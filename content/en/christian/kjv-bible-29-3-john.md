## Third John 1

The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.  {id="1:1"}

Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  {id="1:2"}

For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.  {id="1:3"}

I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.  {id="1:4"}

Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; <sup>1:6</sup> Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: <sup>1:7</sup> Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.  {id="1:5"}

We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.  {id="1:8"}

I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.  {id="1:9"}

Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.  {id="1:10"}

Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.  {id="1:11"}

Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.  {id="1:12"}

I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: <sup>1:14</sup> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.  {id="1:13"}
