Strainer of Vasu art thou. Thou art heaven. Earth art
thou. Thou art Mātarisvan's caldron.

Law Supreme, and do not totter. Nor be thy Lord of
Sacrifice unsteady. {#1:2}

strength therefor. Success attend me.

You two for work, you two for its completion. {#1:6}

Throughout the spacious middle air I travel. {#1:7}

foe's death I set thee on, devoted to priesthood and nobility

mount upward to the sky.

I with the metre Gāyatrī enclose thee. I lay the Trishtup
metre round about thee. With Jagatī metre I confine
and gird thee.[pg 8]

art thou, and a fair seat to rest on. Thou hast both
strengthening food and drink in plenty. {#1:27}

Before the cruel foe's secret departure, Mighty One, raising
high earth, life-bestower, which to the Moon they lifted
by oblations, that earth the sages still point out and worship.
Deposit in its place the sprinkling-water, Thou art the slayer
of the man who hates us. {#1:28}

food, I cleanse for the food's kindling.

A mortal man that he may live. {#3:33}

worshipper.
But now. O Liberal Lord, thy bounty as a God is ever poured
forth more and more. {#3:34}

I, bearing strength, intelligent and happy, come to thee,
House, rejoicing in my spirit. {#3:41}

The home on which the wanderer thinks, where cheerfulness
and joy abound
We call the Home to welcome us. May it know us who
know it well. {#3:42}

Here have the cows been called to us, the goats and sheep
have been called near,
And in our home we have addressed the meath that sweeteneth
our food.
I come to thee for safety and for quiet. May joy be ours,
felicity, and blessing. {#3:43}

We invocate the Maruts, the voracious, eaters of their foes,
Delighting in their mess of meal. {#3:44}

We expiate by sacrifice each sinful act that we have done,
Whether in village or the wild, in company or corporeal
sense. Svāhā! {#3:45}

Let us not here contend with Gods, O Indra, for, Fierce
One! here is thine own sacred portion,
Thine, Mighty One, whose friends, the bounteous Maruts,
his song who pours oblation, streamlike, honours. {#3:46}

The skilful workers have performed their work with voice
that gives delight.
Having performed the work for Gods, go, ye companions, to
your home. {#3:47}

O ever-moving Cleansing Bath, thou movest gliding on thy
way.[pg 23]
With Gods may I wash out the sin that I have sinned
against the Gods, with men the sin against mankind.
Preserve me safe from injury, O God, from him who loudly
roars. {#3:48}

Full, fly away, O spoon, and filled completely fly thou back
to us.
O Satakratu, let us twain barter, like goods, our food and
strength. {#3:49}

Give me, I give thee gifts: bestow on me, and I bestow on
thee.
To me present thy merchandize, and I to thee will give my
wares. {#3:50}

Well have they eaten and regaled: the friends have risen
and passed away.
The sages, luminous in themselves, have praised thee with
their latest hymn.
Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds. {#3:51}

Thee will we reverence, thee, O Lord of Bounty, who art
fair to see.
Thus praised, according to our wish come now with richly-laden
car. Now, Indra, yoke thy two Bay Steeds. {#3:52}

We call the spirit hither with a hero-celebrating strain,
Yea, with the Fathers’ holy hymns. {#3:53}

The spirit comes to us again for wisdom, energy, and life,
That we may long behold the Sun. {#3:54}

O Fathers, may the Heavenly Folk give us the spirit once
again,
That we may be with those who live. {#3:55}

[pg 24]

O Soma, with the spirit still within us, blest with progeny,
May we be busied in thy law. {#3:56}

O Rudra, this is thine allotted portion. With Ambikā thy
sister kindly take it. This, Rudra, is thy share, the rat
thy victim. {#3:57}

We have contented Rudra, yea, put off Tryambaka the God,
That he may make us wealthier, may make us yet more
prosperous, may make us vigorous to act. {#3:58}

Thou art a healing medicine, a balm for cow and horse and
man, a happiness to ram and ewe. {#3:59}

Tryambaka we worship, sweet augmenter of prosperity.
As from its stem a cucumber, may I be freed from bonds of
death, not reft of immortality.
We worship him, Tryambaka, the husband-finder, sweet to
smell.
As from its stem a cucumber, hence and not thence may I
be loosed. {#3:60}

This, Rudra, is thy food: with this depart beyond the
Mūjavāns.
With bow unstrung, with muffled staff, clothed in a garment
made of skin, gracious, not harming us, depart. {#3:61}

May Jamadagni's triple life, the triple life of Kasyapa,
The triple life of Deities—may that same triple life be ours. {#3:62}

[pg 25]

Gracious, thy name; the thunder is thy father. Obeisance
be to thee: forbear to harm me.
I shave thee for long life, for food to feed thee, for progeny,
for riches in abundance, for noble children, for heroic
vigour. {#3:63}

[pg 26]

## BOOK THE FOURTH. {#4}

WE have reached this earth's place of sacrificing, the place
wherein all Deities delighted.
Crossing by Rik, by Sāman, and by Yajus, may we rejoice
in food and growth of riches.
Gracious to me be these Celestial Waters!
Protect me, Plant. O Knife, forbear to harm him.

The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers
of holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us.
For, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement. I rise up
from them purified and brightened.
The form of Consecration and of Fervour art thou. I put
thee on, the kind and blissful, maintaining an agreeable
appearance. {#4:2}

The Great Ones’ milk art thou. Giver of splendour art
thou: bestow on me the gift of splendour.
Pupil art thou of Vritra's eye. The giver of eyes art thou.
Give me the gift of vision. {#4:3}

Purify me the Lord of Thought! Purify me the Lord of
Speech! Purify me God Savitar with perfect strainer, with
the beams of Sūrya![pg 27]
Of thee, Lord of the Strainer! who art by the strainer
purified,
With what desire I purify myself, may I accomplish it. {#4:4}

We come to you for precious wealth, O Gods, as sacrifice
proceeds.
O Gods, we call on you to give blessings that wait on sacrifice. {#4:5}

Svāhā! from mind the sacrifice. Svāhā! from spacious
firmament.
Svāhā! from Dyaus and Prithivī. Svāhā! from Wind I
seize. Svāhā! {#4:6}

To Resolution, Motive, Agni, Svāhā! All-hail to Wisdom,
and to Mind, and Agni!
All-hail to Consecration, Fervour, Agni! Hail to Sarasvatī,
Pūshan, and Agni!
Ye vast, divine, all-beneficial Waters, ye Heaven and Earth
and spacious Air between them,
Let us adore Brihaspati with oblation. All-hail! {#4:7}

May every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding
God.
Each one solicits him for wealth: let him seek fame to prosper
him. {#4:8}

Rik's, Sāman's counterparts are ye. I touch you. Protect
me till the sacrifice be ended.
Thou art a place of refuge. Give me refuge. Obeisance
unto thee! Forbear to harm me. {#4:9}

Strength of Angirases art thou. Wool-soft, bestow thou
strength on me.
Thou art the garment-knot of Soma. Vishnu's refuge art
thou, the Sacrificer's refuge.[pg 28]
Thou art the womb of Indra. Make the crops produce
abundant grain.
Stand up erect, O Tree. Protect me from harm until this
sacrifice be ended. {#4:10}

Prepare ye vow-food. Agni is the Brahman, Agni is sacrifice,
the tree is holy.
For aid we meditate divine Intelligence, most merciful,
Free-giver, bringing worship May it guide us gently, as
we would.
Favour us Gods, mind-horn, endowed with mind and intellectual
might! All-hail to them! May they be our protectors. {#4:11}

Waters that we have drunk! become refreshing, become
auspicious draughts within our belly.
Free from all sin and malady and sickness, may they be
pleasant to our taste, divine Ones, immortal, strengtheners
of eternal Order. {#4:12}

This is thy sacrificial form.
Not offspring, waters I discharge. Freeing from sin and
consecrate by Svāhā enter ye the earth. Be thou united
with the earth. {#4:13}

O Agni, watch thou well. May we take joy in most refreshing
sleep.
Protect us with unceasing care. From slumber waken us
again. {#4:14}

[pg 29]

Thought hath returned to me, and life; my breath and
soul have come again.
Our bodies' guard, unscathed, Vaisvānara Agni preserve us
from misfortune and dishonour. {#4:15}

Thou, Agni, art the guardian God of sacred vows among
mankind, thou meet for praise at holy rites.
Grant this much, Soma! bring yet more. God Savitar who
giveth wealth hath given treasure unto us. {#4:16}

This is thy form, O Bright One, this thy lustre. Combine
with this thy form and go to splendour.
Impetuous art thou, upheld by mind, and Vishnu loveth
thee. {#4:17}

Moved by thine impulse who hast true impulsion, may I
obtain a prop to stay my body.
Pure art thou, glistering art thou, immortal, dear to all the
Gods. {#4:18}

Thought art thou, mind, intelligence, the Guerdon, royal,
worshipful, Aditi with a double head. Succeed for us in
going forth, succeed for us in thy return. May Mitra
bind thee by the foot. May Pūshan guard thy pathways
for Indra whose eye is over all. {#4:19}

[pg 30]

Thy mother give thee leave to go, thy father, thine own
brother, and thy friend of the same herd with thee!
Go thou, O Goddess, to the God. To Soma go for Indra's
sake.
May Rudra turn thee back. Return safely with Soma as
thy friend. {#4:20}

Thou art a Vasvī, thou art Aditi, thou art an Ādityā, thou
art a Rudrā, thou art a Chandrā.
Brihaspati vouchsafe thee rest and comfort! Rudra with
Vasus looks on thee with favour. {#4:21}

On Aditi's head I sprinkle thee, on the earth's place of
sacrifice.
Footstep of Idā art thou, filled with fatness. Hail!
Rejoice in us. Thy kinship is in us. In thee are riches.
Mine be riches! Let us not be deprived of abundant
riches. Thine, thine are riches. {#4:22}

I with my thought have commerced with divine far-sighted
Dakshinā.
Steal not my life. I will not thine. May I, O Goddess, in
thy sight find for myself a hero son. {#4:23}

Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Gāyatrī.
For me say this to Soma: This is thine allotted Trishtup
share.
Tell Soma this for me: This is thy share allied with Jagatī.
Tell Soma this for me: Win thou sole lordship of the metres’
names.
Ours art thou: pure thy juice for draught. Let separators
pick thee out. {#4:24}

[pg 31]

I sing my song of praise to him, Savitar, God between the
Bowls, strong with the wisdom of the wise, of true impulsion,
wealth-giver, the well-beloved thoughtful Sage.
To him at whose impulsion shone aloft in heaven the splendid
light.
Most wise, the Golden-handed hath measured the sky with
skilled design.
For living creatures, thee. Let living creatures breathe
after thee. Breathe after living creatures. {#4:25}

Thee who art pure, with what is pure I purchase, the bright
with bright, immortal with immortal.
The Sacrificer keep thy cow. Let thy gold pieces be with us.
Fervour's form art thou, and Prajāpati's nature. With the
most noble animal art thou purchased. May I increase
with thousandfold abundance. {#4:26}

As friend, the giver of good friends, approach us!
Take thou thy seat on the right thigh of Indra, yearning on
yearning, pleasing on the pleasing.
Anghāri, Svāna, Bhrāja, and Bambhāri, O Hasta, and Suhasta
and Krisānu,
These are your prices for the Soma purchase. Keep them
securely, let them never fail you. {#4:27}

Keep me, O Agni, from unrighteous conduct: make me a
sharer in the path of goodness.[pg 32]
I, following Immortals, have arisen with longer life, with a
good life before me. {#4:28}

Now have we entered on the path that leads to bliss without
a foe,
The path whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers
wealth. {#4:29}

The skin of Aditi art thou. Sit on the lap of Aditi.
The Bull hath propped the sky and air's mid-region, the
compass of the broad earth hath he measured.
He, King Supreme, approached all living creatures. Truly
all these are Varuna's ordinances. {#4:30}

Over the woods the air hath he extended, put milk in kine
and vigorous speed in horses,
Set intellect in hearts and fire in houses, Sūrya in heaven
and Soma on the mountain. {#4:31}

Ascend the eye of Sūrya, mount the pupil set in Agni's eye
Where, radiant through the Wise One, thou speedest along
with dappled steeds. {#4:32}

Approach, ye oxen, fit to bear the yoke; be yoked without
a tear.
Slaying no man, urging the Brahman forward, go happily
to the Sacrificer's dwelling. {#4:33}

Lord of the World, thou art my gracious helper: move forward
on thy way to all the stations.
Let not opponents, let not robbers find thee, let not malignant
wolves await thy coming.
Fly thou away having become a falcon. Go to the dwelling
of the Sacrificer. That is the special place for us to rest in. {#4:34}

[pg 33]

Do homage unto Varuna's and Mitra's eye: offer this solemn
worship to the Mighty God,
Who seeth far away, the Ensign born of Gods. Sing praises
unto Sūrya, to the Son of Dyaus. {#4:35}

Thou art a prop for Varuna to rest on. Ye are the pins that
strengthen Varuna's pillar.
Thou art the lawful seat where Varuna sitteth. Sit on the
lawful seat where Varuna sitteth. {#4:36}

Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour,
may they all invest our worship.
Wealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the
brave, come, Soma, to our houses. {#4:37}

* * *

[pg 34]

## BOOK THE FIFTH {#5}

BODY of Agni art thou. Thee for Vishnu. Body of Soma art
thou. Thee for Vishnu. Thou art the Guest's Reception.

thee with the Trishtup metre. I rub and churn thee with,
the Jagatī metre. {#5:2}

Be ye for us one-minded, be one-thoughted, free from spot
and stain.
Harm not the sacrifice, harm not the sacrifice's lord. Be
kind to us this day, Omniscient Ones! {#5:3}

Preserver from the curse, Son of the Rishis, Agni is active
having entered Agni.
Here for us kindly with fair worship offer oblation to the
Gods with care unceasing. Svāhā! {#5:4}

For him who flies around and rushes onward I take thee,
for Tanūnapāt the mighty, the very strong, of all-surpassing
vigour.[pg 35]
Strength of the Gods, inviolate, inviolable still art thou, the
strength that turns the curse away, uncursed and never
to be cursed.
May I go straight to truth. Place me in comfort. {#5:5}

O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, in
thee
Whatever form there is of thine, may that same form be
here on me: un thee be every form of mine.
O Lord of Vows, let our vows be united. May Dīkshā's
Lord allow my Consecration, may holy Fervour's Lord
approve my Fervour. {#5:6}

May every stalk of thine wax full and strengthen for Indra
Ekadhanavid, God Soma!
May Indra grow in strength for thee: for Indra mayest thou
grow strong.
Increase us friends with strength and mental vigour. May
all prosperity be thine, God Soma. May I attain the
solemn Soma-pressing.
May longed-for wealth come forth for strength and fortune.
Let there be truth for those whose speech is truthful. To
Heaven and Earth be adoration offered. {#5:7}

That noblest body which is thine, O Agni, laid in the lowest
deep, encased in iron, hath chased the awful word, the
word of terror. Svāhā!
That noblest . . . . . . encased in silver, etc. Svāhā
That noblest . . . . with gold around it, etc. Svāhā! {#5:8}

[pg 36]

For me thou art the home of the afflicted. For me thou art
the gathering-place of riches. Protect me from the, woe
of destitution.
Protect me from the state of perturbation.
May Agni know thee, he whose name is Nabhas. Go, Agni,
Angiras, with the name of Āyu.
Thou whom this earth containeth, down I lay thee with each
inviolate holy name thou bearest.
Thou whom the second earth, etc. Thou whom the third
earth, etc.
Thee, further, for the Gods’ delight. {#5:9}

A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be fitted for the Gods.
A foe-subduing lioness art thou: be purified for Gods.
A foe-subduing lioness art thou: adorn thyself for Gods. {#5:10}

Indra's shout guard thee in the front with Vasus. The Wise
One guard thee from the rear with Rudras. The Thought-swift
guard thee on the right with Fathers. The Omnific
guard thee, leftward, with Ādityas.
This heated water I eject and banish from the sacrifice. {#5:11}

[pg 37]

Firm art thou, steady thou the earth. Firm-seated art thou,
steady thou the air.
Movelessly set art thou, steady the sky. Agni's completion
art thou. {#5:13}

The priests of him the lofty Priest well-skilled in hymns
harness their spirits, yea harness their holy thoughts.
He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea,
lofty is the praise of Savitar the God. All-hail! {#5:14}

Forth through This All strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he
planted, and the whole was gathered in his footstep's dust.
All-hail! {#5:15}

Rich in sweet food be ye, and rich in milch-kine, with fertile
pastures, fair to do men service.
Both these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed asunder, and
firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it. {#5:16}

Heard by the Gods, ye twain, to Gods proclaim it.
Go eastward, O ye twain, proclaiming worship. Swerve ye
not: bear the sacrifice straight upward.
To your own cow-pen speak, ye godlike dwellings.
Speak not away my life, speak not away my children.
On the earth's summit here may ye be joyful. {#5:17}

[pg 38]

Now will I tell the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who
measured out the earthly regions.
Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting
down his foot and widely striding.
For Vishnu thee. {#5:18}

Either from heaven or from the earth, O Vishnu, or, Vishnu,
from the vast wide air's mid-region,
Fill both thy hands full with abundant riches, and from the
right and from the left bestow them.
For Vishnu thee. {#5:19}

For this his mighty deed is Vishnu lauded, like some wild
beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming,
He within whose three wide-extended paces all living creatures
have their habitation, {#5:20}

Thou art the frontlet for the brow of Vishnu. Ye are the
corners of the mouth of Vishnu. Thou art the needle
for the work of Vishnu. Thou art the firmly-fastened knot
of Vishnu. To Vishnu thou belongest. Thee for Vishnu. {#5:21}

By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins
and with hands of Pūshan.
Thou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Rākshasas away.
Mighty art thou, mighty the sound thou makest. Utter thy
mighty-sounding voice to Indra: {#5:22}

Fiend-killing, charm-destroying voice of Vishnu.
Here I cast out that charm of magic power which stranger
or housemate for me hath buried.[pg 39]
Here I cast out the charm of magic power buried for me
by equal or unequal.
Here I cast out the charm that hath been buried for me by
non-relation or relation.
I cast the charm of magic out. {#5:23}

Self-ruler art thou, conquering foes. Ruler for ever art
thou, killing enemies.
Men's ruler art thou, slaying fiends. All ruler, killing foes,
art thou. {#5:24}

I sprinkle you whom Vishnu owns, killers of fiends and evil
charms.
I buy down you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and
wicked charms.
I scatter you whom Vishnu loves, killers of fiends and
wicked charms.
You two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms
do I lay down.
You two whom Vishnu loves, who kill fiends and ill charms
I compass round.
To Vishnu thou belongest. Ye are Vishnu's. {#5:25}

By impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,
with the hands of Peahen.
Thou art a woman. Here I cut the necks of Rākshasas away.
Barley art thou. Bar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.
Thee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for air's region.
Pure be the worlds, the Fathers’ dwelling-places. Thou art
the habitation of the Fathers. {#5:26}

[pg 40]

Prop heaven, fill full the air, on earth stand firmly. Dyutāna,
offspring of the Maruts, plant thee!, Mitra and Varuna
with firm upholding.
I close thee in, thou winner of the Brahmans, winner of
Nobles and abundant riches.
Strengthen the Brahmans, strengthen thou the Nobler,
strengthen our vital power, strengthen our offspring. {#5:27}

Firm-set art thou. Firm be this Sacrificer within this home
with offspring and with cattle.
O Heaven and Earth, be ye filled full of fatness.
Indra's mat art thou, shelter of all people. {#5:28}

Lover of song, may these our songs encompass thee on every
side;
Strengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear
delights to thee {#5:29}

A sea art thou of all-embracing compass. Aja art thou, who
hath one foot to bear him. Thou art the Dragon of the
Depths of ocean. Speech art thou, thou the Sadas, thou
art Indra's. Doors of the sacrifice, do not distress me!
Lord, Ruler of the pathways, lead me onward. In this God-reaching
path may I be happy. {#5:33}

Look ye upon me with the eye of Mitra.
O Agnis, ye, receivers of oblations, are by a lauded name
lauded together. Protect me, Agnis! with your glittering
army. Fill me with riches, Agnis! be my keepers. To
you be adoration. Do not harm me. {#5:34}

Thou art a light that wears all forms and figures, serving
the general host of Gods as Kindler.[pg 42]
Thou, Soma, wilt withhold thy wide protection from body-wounding
hatreds shown by others. All-hail!
Let the Swift graciously enjoy the butter. All-hail! {#5:35}

By goodly paths lead us to riches, Agni, thou God who
knowest every sacred duty.
Remove the sin that makes us stray and wander: most
ample adoration will we bring thee. {#5:36}

Wide room and comfort may this Agni give us, and go before
us cleaving down our foemen.
May he win booty in the fight for booty: May he quell foes
in his triumphant onset. {#5:37}

O Vishnu, stride thou widely forth, give ample room for our
abode.
Drink butter, homed in butter! Still speed on the sacrifice's
lord. All-hail! {#5:38}

To thee, God Savitar, belongs this Soma. Guard him securely:
let not demons harm thee.
Now hast thou joined the Gods as God, God Soma: men
have I joined here through abundant riches.
All-hail! from Varuna's noose am I delivered. {#5:39}

O Agni, Guardian of the Vow, O Guardian of the Vow, on
me whatever form of thine path been, may that same
form be upon thee. Whatever form of mine hath been on
thee, may that he here on me.
O Lord of Vows, our vows have been accomplished. Dīkshā's
Lord hath approved my Consecration, and holy Fervour's
Lord allowed my Fervour. {#5:40}

O Vishnu, stride thou widely forth, make ample room for
our abode.
Drink butter, homed in butter! Still speed on the sacrifice's
lord. All Hail! {#5:41}

[pg 43]

I have passed others, not approached to others. On the near
side of those that were more distant, and farther than
the nearer have I found thee.
So, for the worship of the Gods, with gladness we welcome
thee God, Sovran of the Forest! Let the Gods welcome
thee for the Gods’ service. For Vishnu thee. Plant, guard!!
Axe, do not harm it! {#5:42}

Graze not the sky. Harm not mid-air. Be in accordance with
the earth.
For this well-sharpened axe hath led thee forth to great
felicity.
Hence, with a hundred branches, God, Lord of the Forest,
grow thou up.
May we grow spreading with a hundred branches. {#5:43}

BY impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,
with the hands of Pūshan. Thou art a woman. Here
I cut the necks of Rākshasas away. Barley art thou.
Bar off from us our haters, bar our enemies.
Thee for heaven, thee for earth, thee for the welkin. Pure
be the worlds, the Fathers’ dwelling-places. Thou art the
habitation of the Fathers.

Thou art a leader, easy, to Unnetars, of access. Know
this. It will stand upon thee.
Savitar, God, anoint thee with sweet butter. Thee for the
plants laden with goodly fruitage!
Thou with thy top hast touched the sky, hast with thy
middle filled the air, and steadied with thy base the earth. {#6:2}

Those seats of thine which we desire to visit, where there
are many-horned and nimble. oxen,
There, of a truth, was mightily imprinted the loftiest step
of widely-striding Vishnu.
I close thee in, the winner of the Brāhmans, winner of
Nobles and abundant riches.
Strengthen the Brāhmans, strengthen thou the Nobles,
strengthen our vital power, strengthen our offspring. {#6:3}

Look ye on Vishnu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra,
close-allied,
Hath let his holy ways be seen. {#6:4}

The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where
Vishnu is,
Laid as it were an eye in heaven. {#6:5}

Thou art invested. Heavenly hosts invest thee! Riches of
men invest this Sacrificer!
Heaven's son art thou. This is thine earthly station. Thine
is the beast whose home is in the forest. {#6:6}

Encourager art thou. The hosts of heaven have come to
yearning Gods, the best conductors.
God Tvashtar, make the wealth of cattle quiet. Delightful
to the taste be thine oblations. {#6:7}

Joy, wealthy ones! Brihaspati, save our riches.
I bind thee with the noose of holy Order, thou offering to
the Gods. Bold be the Slayer. {#6:8}

By impulse of God Savitar I bind thee, with arms of Asvins
and with hands of Pūshan, thee welcome unto Agni and
to Soma.
Thee for the waters, thee for plants. Thy mother grant
thee permission, and thy father, brother born of one dam,
thy friend, thy herd-companion. I sprinkle thee welcome
to Agni-Soma. {#6:9}

Drinker art thou of water. May the Waters, the Goddesses,
add sweetness to the oblation prepared for Gods, even
though already sweetened.[pg 46]
Thy breath join wind, thy limbs those meet for worship, the
sacrifice's lord the boon he prays for. {#6:10}

Balmed, both of you, with butter, guard the cattle. Grant,
Rich! the Sacrificer's prayer. Approach thou.
Meeting with heavenly Wind, from air's mid-region. Be
thou united with this offering's body.
O Great One, lead the sacrifice's master on to a sacrifice of
loftier order. All-hail to Gods! To Gods All-hail! {#6:11}

O widely-spread, be adoration.
Advance, unhindered, on thy way. To rivers of butter
move along the paths of Order. {#6:12}

and well-provided. May we become providers well-provided. {#6:13}

I cleanse thy voice, thy breath, thine eye, thine ear, thy
navel, and thy feet, thy sexual organ, and thy rump. {#6:14}

Let thy mind, voice, and breath increase in fulness, thine

Whatever there is in thee sore or wounded, may that be
filled for thee, cleansed and united.
Blest be the days. Plant, guard! Axe, do not harm him. {#6:15}

Thou art the demons’ share. Expelled are demons. Here
I tread down; here I repel the demons; here lead the
demons into lowest darkness.[pg 47]
Invest, ye two, the heaven and earth with fatness.
O Vāyu, eagerly enjoy the droppings. Let Agni eagerly
enjoy the butter. All-hail!
Go, both of you, by Svāhā consecrated, to Ūrdhvanabhas,
offspring of the Maruts. {#6:16}

Ye Waters, wash away this stain and whatsoever taint be here,
Each sinful act that I have done, and every harmless curse
of mine.
May Waters rid me of that guilt, and Pavamāna set me free. {#6:17}

Be they united, with the Mind thy mind, and with the Breath
thy breath.
Thou quiverest. Let Agni make thee ready. Waters have
washed together all thy juices.
Thee for the Wind's rush, for the speed of Pūshan. From
heated vapour may it reel and totter,—the disconcerted
hatred of our foemen. {#6:18}

Ye drinkers-up of fatness, drink the fatness; drink up the
gravy, drinkers of the gravy! Thou art the oblation of the
air's mid-region. All-hail!
The regions, the fore-regions, the by-regions, the intermediate
and the upper regions,—to all the regions Hail! {#6:19}

In every limb is Indra's out-breath seated, in every limb is
Indra's in-breath settled.
God Tvashtar, let thine ample forms be blended, that what
wears different shapes may be one-fashioned.

thee as to the Gods thou goest. {#6:20}

Agni. All hail! Bestow upon me mind and heart.
Thy smoke mount to the sky, to heaven thy lustre. Fill
thou the spacious earth full with thine ashes. {#6:21}

Harm not the Waters, do the Plants no damage. From every
place, King Varuna, thence save us.
Their saying that we swear our oath by sacred cows, by
Varuna,
O Varuna, save us therefrom.
To us let Waters and let Plants be friendly; to him who
hates us, whom we hate, unfriendly. {#6:22}

These waters teem with sacred food: rich in that food, one
longs for them.
Rich be the holy rite therein. In sacred food be Sūrya rich. {#6:23}

I set you down in Agni's seat whose home is indestructible.
Indra-and-Agni's share are ye, Mitra-and-Varuna's share are
ye.
The share of all the Gods are ye.
May waters gathered near the Sun, and those wherewith the
Sun is joined,
Speed on this sacred rite of ours. {#6:24}

may this man win him riches. {#9:6}

It was the wind, or it was thought, or the Gandharvas

These at the first harnessed the horse: they set the power

Brihaspati's portion, O ye Horses. {#9:9}

ways and meting out the courses! {#9:13}

Bound by the neck and at the flanks and in the mouth,

Drawing himself together as his strength allows, Dadhikrās
speeds along the windings of the paths. All-hail! {#9:14}

His pinion, rapid runner, fans him on his way, as of a bird
that hastens onward to its aim,
And, as it were a falcon's gliding through the air, strikes
Dadhikrāvan's side as he speeds on with might. All-hail! {#9:15}

Bless us the Coursers when we call, while slowly they move,
strong singers, to the Gods’ assembly.
Crushing the wolf, the serpent, and the demons, may they
completely banish all affliction. All-hail! {#9:16}

May all those vigorous Coursers listen to our cry, hearers
of invocation, speeders on their way;
Winners of thousands, fain to win where meed is won, who

help us in each fray for booty.
Drink of this meath, be satisfied, be joyful: then go on
paths which Gods are wont to travel. {#9:18}

these, Heaven and Earth, who wear each form and figure!
Hither may Father come to me, and Mother. Soma with
immortality approach me! {#9:19}

HARNESSING, first of all, the mind, Savitar having stretched
the thought
With reverent look upon the light of Agni bore them up

By impulse of God Savitar we with our spirit harnessed strive
With might to win the heavenly. {#11:2}

Savitar, having harnessed Gods who go to light and heavenly
thought,
Who will create the lofty light—Savitar urge them on their
way! {#11:3}

The priests of him the lofty priest well skilled in hymns,
harness their spirit, yea, harness their holy thoughts.
He only, skilled in rules, assigns their priestly tasks. Yea,
lofty is the praise of Savitar the God. {#11:4}

I yoke with prayer your ancient inspiration: may the laud
rise as on the prince's pathway.
All Sons of the Immortal One shall hear it, who have resorted
to celestial dwellings. {#11:5}

Even he, the God whose going forth and majesty the other
Deities have followed with their might,
He who hath measured the celestial regions out by his great
power, he is the Courser Savitar. {#11:6}

Our sacrifice, God Savitar! speed forward: speed to his share

God Savitar, speed this God-loved sacrifice of ours,
friend-finding, ever-conquering, winning wealth and heaven.
Speed praise-song with the sacred verse, Rathantara with
Gāyatra, Brihat that runs in Gāyatra. All-hail! {#11:8}

By impulse of God Savitar I take thee, with arms of Asvins,
with the hands of Pūshan, in Angiras’ manner, with
Gāyatrī metre.
From the earth's seat bring thou Purīshya Agni, as Angiras
was wont, with Trishtup metre. {#11:9}

Spade art thou; woman art thou. Ours be power with thee
to dig out Agni in his dwelling, as Angiras was wont, with
Jagatī metre. {#11:10}

Savitar, bearing in his hand the gold spade which he took
therewith,
Looking with reverence on the light of Agni, raised it from
the earth,
With the Anushtup metre and as Angiras was wont to do. {#11:11}

Run hither, urged to speed, O Horse, along the most extended
space.[pg 89]

Upon this course, O lords of wealth, harness; ye twain, the
Ass who bears
Agni, and kindly favours us. {#11:13}

In every need, in every race we call, as friends, to succour us,
Indra, the mightiest of all. {#11:14}

Come speeding on and trampling imprecations; come
gladdening to the chieftainship of Rudra.
Speed through the wide air thou whose paths are pleasant,
with Pūshan for thy mate, providing safety. {#11:15}

From the Earth's seat, like Anginas, bring thou Purīshya
Agni forth.
After the wont of Angiras we to Purīshya Agni go.
Agni Purīshya we will bear after the went of Angiras. {#11:16}

Agni hath looked along the van of Mornings, looked on the
days, the earliest Jātavedas,

O Courser, having come to earth, seek Agni with a longing
wish.
Tell us by trampling on the ground where we may dig him

Heaven is thy back, the earth thy seat, the air thy soul,
the sea thy womb.
Looking around thee with thine eye trample the adversaries
down. {#11:20}

Wealth-giver, Courser, from this place step forth to great
felicity.
May we enjoy Earth's favour while we dig forth Agni from
her {#11:21}

Down hath he stepped, wealth-giver, racer, courser. Good
and auspicious room on earth thou madest.
Thence let us dig forth Agni, fair to look on, while to the
loftiest vault we mount, to heaven. {#11:22}

I thoughtfully besprinkle thee with butter, thee dwelling
near to all existing creatures.
Broad, vast through vital power that moves transversely,
conspicuous, strong with all the food that feeds thee. {#11:23}

I sprinkle him who moves in all directions: may he accept
it with a friendly spirit.
Agni with bridegroom's face and lovely colour may not be
touched when all his form is fury. {#11:24}

Round the oblation bath he paced, Agni the wise, the Lord
of Strength,
Giving the offerer precious boons. {#11:25}

We set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni, thee a Sage,
Of hero lineage, day by day destroyer of our treacherous foes. {#11:26}

Thou, Agni, with the days, fain to shine hitherward, art
brought to life from out the waters, from the stone,[pg 91]
From out the forest trees and herbs that grow on ground.

At Savitar's, the Shining One's, impulsion, with arms of
Asvins and with hands of Pūshan,
As Angiras was wont to do, I dig thee forth from the seat
of Earth, Agni Purīshya.
Thee, Agni, luminous and fair of aspect, resplendent with
imperishable lustre, gracious to living creatures, never
harming,
As Angiras was wont to do, we dig thee forth from the seat
of Earth, Agni Purīshya. {#11:28}

Thou art the Waters’ back, the womb of Agni, around the
ocean as it swells and surges.
Waxing to greatness, resting on the lotus, spread thou in
amplitude with heaven's own measure. {#11:29}

Yea are a shelter and a shield, uninjured both, and widely
spread.
Do ye; expansive, cover him: bear ye Purīshya Agni up. {#11:30}

Cover him, finders of the light, united both with breast and
self,
Bearing between you Agni, the refulgent, everlasting One. {#11:31}

Thou art Purīshya, thou support of all. Atharvan was the
first, Agni, who rubbed thee into life.
Agni, Atharvan brought thee forth by rubbing from the
lotus, from
The head of Visva, of the Priest. {#11:32}

Thee too as Vritra-slayer, thee breaker of forts, the Sage
Dadhyach,
Son of Atharvan, lighted up. {#11:33}

Pāthya the Bull, too, kindled thee the Dasyus’ most
destructive foe,
Winner of spoil in every fight. {#11:34}

Sit, Hotar, in the Hotar's place, observant: lay down the
sacrifice in the place of worship.
Thou, dear to Go is, shalt serve them with oblation. Agni,
give long life to the Sacrificer. {#11:35}

Accustomed to the Hotar's place, the Hotar hath seated him,
bright, splendid, passing mighty,
Whose foresight keeps the Law from violation, excellent,
pure-tongued, bringing thousands, Agni. {#11:36}

Seat thee, for thou art mighty: shine, best entertainer of
the Gods.
Worthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke, ruddy
and beautiful to see. {#11:37}

Pour heavenly Waters honey-sweet here for our health, for
progeny.
Forth from the place whereon they fall let plants with goodly
berries spring. {#11:38}

May Vāyu Mātarisvan heal and comfort thy broken heart as
there supine thou liest.
Thou unto whom the breath of Gods gives motion, to Ka,
yea, unto thee, O God, be Vashat! {#11:39}

He, nobly born with lustre, shield and refuge, hath sat down
in light.
O Agni, Rich in Splendour, robe thyself in many-hued attire. {#11:40}

Lord of fair sacrifice; arise! With Godlike thought protect
us well.[pg 93]
With great light splendid to behold come, Agni, through
sweet hymns of praise. {#11:41}

Rise up erect to give us aid, stand up like Savitar the God;
Erect as strength-bestower when we call aloud, with unguents
and with priests on thee. {#11:42}

Thou, being horn, art Child of Earth and Heaven, parted, fair
Babe, among the plants, O Agni.
The glooms of night thou, brilliant child, subduest, and art
come forth, loud roaring, from the Mothers. {#11:43}

Steady be thou, and firm of limb. Steed, be a racer fleet of
foot.
Broad be thou, pleasant as a seat, bearing the store which
Agni needs. {#11:44}

Be thou propitious, Angiras, to creatures of the human race.
Set not on fire the heaven and earth, nor air's mid-region,
nor the trees. {#11:45}

Forth with loud neighing go the Steed, the Ass that shouteth
as he runs.
Bearing Purīshya Agni on, let him not perish ere his time,
Male bearer of male Agni, Child of Waters, Offspring of the
Sea. Agni, come hither to the feast. {#11:46}

The Law the Truth, the Law the Truth. As Angiras was
wont to do, we bear Purīshya Agni on.
Ye Plants, with joyous welcome greet this Agni, auspicious
One who cometh on to meet you.
Removing all distresses and afflictions, here settle down and
banish evil purpose. {#11:47}

[pg 94]

Welcome him joyfully, ye Plants, laden with bloom and
goodly fruit.
This seasonable Child of yours hath settled in his ancient
seat. {#11:48}

Resplendent with thy wide-extending lustre dispel the terrors
of the fiends who hate us.
May lofty Agni be my guide and shelter, ready to hear our
call, the good Protector. {#11:49}

Ye, Waters, are beneficent, so help ye us to energy
That we may look on great delight. {#11:50}

Give us a portion of the sap, the most propitious that ye
have.
Like mothers in their longing love. {#11:51}

To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye lead us
on:
And, Waters, give us procreant strength. {#11:52}

Mitra, having commingled earth and ground together with
the light
For health to creatures mix I thee Omniscient and nobly
born. {#11:53}

The Rudras, having mixed the earth, set all aglow the lofty
light.
Bright and perpetual their light verily shines among the
Gods. {#11:54}

The lump of clay that hath been mixed by Vasus, Rudras,
by the wise,
May Sinīvālī with her hands soften and fit it for the work. {#11:55}

May Sinīvālī with fair braids, with beauteous crest, with
lovely locks,
May she, O mighty Aditi, bestow the Fire-pan in thy hands. {#11:56}

[pg 95]

Aditi shape the Fire-pan with her power, her arms, her
intellect,
And in her womb bear Agni as a mother, in her lap, her
son. {#11:57}

With Gāyatrī, like Angiras the Vasus form and fashion thee!
Stedfast art then, thou art the Earth. Establish in me progeny,
command of cattle, growth of wealth, kinsmen for
me the worshipper.
With Trishtup may the Rudras, like Angiras, form and
fashion thee.
Stedfast art thou, thou art the Air. Establish in me, etc.,
as above.
With Jagatī, like Angiras, Ādityas form and fashion thee!
Stedfast art thou, thou art the Sky. Establish in me, etc.
Friends of all men, the All-Gods with Anushtup form thee
Angiras-like.
Stedfast art thou, thou art the Quarters. Establish in me,
etc. {#11:58}

The zone of Aditi art thou. Aditi seize thy hollow space.
She, having made the great Fire-pan, a womb for Agni,
formed of clay,
Aditi, gave it to her Sons and, Let them bake it, were her
words. {#11:59}

The Vasus make thee fragrant, as Angiras did, with Gāyatrī!
The Rudras make thee fragrant with the Trishtup, as did
Angiras!
With Gāyatrī, like Angiras, may the Ādityas perfume thee.
Dear to all men, may the All-Gods with the Anushtup
sweeten thee, as Angiras was wont to do.
May Indra make thee odorous. May Varuna make thee
odorous. May Vishnu make thee odorous. {#11:60}

[pg 96]

Pit! Angiras-like may Aditi the Goddess, beloved by all
Gods, dig thee in Earth's bosom.
Pan! Angiras-like may the Gods’ heavenly Consorts, dear
to all Gads, in the Earth's bosom place thee.
Pan! Angiras-like may Dhishanās, Divine Ones, dear to alt
Gods, in the Earth's bosom light thee.
Pan! Angiras-like may the divine Varūtrīs, dear to all Gods,
in the earth's bosom heat thee,
Pan! Angiras-like may the celestial Ladies, dear to all Gods,
in the earth's bosom bake thee.
Angiras-like may the celestial Matrons, beloved by all the
Gods, with unclipped pinions, within the lap of Earth,
O Fire pan, bake thee. {#11:61}

The gainful grace of Mitra, God, supporter of the race of
man,
Is glorious, of most wondrous fame. {#11:62}

With lovely arms, with lovely hands, with lovely fingers
may the God Savitar make thee clean, yea, by the power
be hath.
Not trembling on the earth fill thou the regions, fill the
Quarters full. {#11:63}

Having arisen wax thou great, yea, stand thou up
immovable.
To thee, O Mitra, I entrust this Fire-pan for security. May
it remain without a break. {#11:64}

Thee may the Vasus, Angiras-like, fill with the metre
Gāyatrī.
Thee may the Rudras, Angiras-like, fill with the Trishtup
metre full.[pg 97]
Thee may Ādityas, Angiras-like, fill with the metre Jagatī.
With the Anushtup metre may the All-Gods, dear to all
men, fill thee full, as Angiras was wont. {#11:65}

Intention, Agni. Motive, Hail! Mind, Wisdom, Agni, Motive,
Hail!
Thought, Knowledge, Agni, Motive, Hail! Rule of Speech,
Agni, Motive, Hail!
To Manu Lord of creatures, Hail! To Agni dear to all men,
Hail! {#11:66}

May every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding God.
Each one solicits him for wealth: let him seek fame to
prosper him. All-hail! {#11:67}

Break not, nor suffer any harm. Endure, O Mother, and
be brave;
This work will thou and Agni do. {#11:68}

Be firm for weal, O Goddess Earth. Made in the wonted
manner thou
Art a celestial design.
Acceptable to Gods he this oblation. Arise thou in this
sacrifice uninjured. {#11:69}

Wood-fed, bedewed with sacred oil, ancient, Invoker,
excellent,
The Son of Strength, the Wonderful. {#11:70}

Abandoning the foeman's host, pass hither to this company:
Assist the men with whom I stand. {#11:71}

From the remotest distance come, Lord of the Red Steeds,
hitherward.
Do thou Purīshya, Agni, loved of many, overcome our foes. {#11:72}

[pg 98]

O Agni, whatsoever be the fuel that we lay on thee,
May that he butter unto thee. Be pleased therewith, Most
Youthful God. {#11:73}

That which the termite eats away, that over which the
emmet crawls—
Butter be all of this to thee. Be pleased therewith, Most
Youthful God. {#11:74}

Bringing to him, with care unceasing, fodder day after day
as to a stabled courser,
Joying in food and in the growth of riches, may we thy
neighbours, Agni, ne’er be injured. {#11:75}

While on earth's navel Agni is enkindled, we call, for
ample increase of our riches,
On Agni joying in the draught, much-lauded, worshipful;
victor conquering in battle. {#11:76}

Whatever hosts there are, fiercely assailant, charging in
lengthened lines, drawn up in order,
Whatever thieves there are, whatever robbers, all these I
cast into thy mouth, O Agni. {#11:77}

Devour the burglars with both tusks, destroy the robbers
with thy teeth.
With both thy jaws, thou Holy One, eat up those thieves
well champed and chewed. {#11:78}

The burglars living among men, the thieves and robbers in
the wood,
Criminals lurking in their lairs, these do I lay between thy
jaws. {#11:79}

Him who would seek to injure us, the man who looks oh
us with hate
Turn thou to ashes, and the man who slanders and would
injure us. {#11:80}

[pg 99]

Quickened is this my priestly rank, quickened is manly
strength and force,
Quickened is his victorious power of whom I am the Household
priest. {#11:81}

The arms of these men have I raised, have raised their
lustre and their strength
With priestly power I ruin foes and lift my friends to high
estate. {#11:82}

A share of food, O Lord of Food, vouchsafe us, invigorating
food that brings no sickness.
Onward, still onward lead the giver. Grant us maintenance
both for quadruped and biped. {#11:83}

* * *

[pg 100]

## BOOK THE TWELFTH. {#12}

FAR hath he shone abroad like gold to look on, beaming
imperishable life for glory.
Agni by vital powers became immortal when his prolific
Father Dyaus begat him.

Night and Dawn, different in hue, accordant, meeting
together, suckle one same infant.
Golden between the heaven and earth he shineth. The
wealth-possessing Gods supported Agni. {#12:2}

The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped
and biped he hath brought forth good.
Excellent Savitar hath looked on heaven's high vault: he
shineth after the outgoings of the Dawn. {#12:3}

Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: thou hast the Trivrit for
thy head.
Gāyatra is thine eye, thy wings are Brihat and Rathantara.
The hymn is self, the metres are his limbs, the formulas his
name.
The Vāmadevya Sāman is thy form, the Yajñāyajñiya thy
tail, the fire-hearths are thy hooves.
Thou art the goodly-pinioned Bird: go skyward, soar to
heavenly light. {#12:4}

[pg 101]

Thou art the riyal-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the
Gāyatra metre: stride along the earth.
Thou art the foe-destroying stride of Vishnu. Mount the
Trishtup metre: stride along mid-air.
Thou art the traitor-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount the
Jagatī metre: stride along the sky.
Thou art the foeman-slaying stride of Vishnu. Mount
Anushtup metre: stride along the Quarters. {#12:5}

Agni roared out like Dyaus what time he thunders: licking
full oft the earth round plants he flickered.
At once, when born, he looked about, enkindled: he shineth
forth between the earth and heaven. {#12:6}

Return to me, thou still-returning Agni, with life, with
lustre, progeny, and treasure,
With profit, wisdom, riches, and abundance. {#12:7}

A hundred, Agni Angiras! be thy ways, a thousand thy
returns.
With increment of increase bring thou back to us what we
have lost. Again bring hitherward our wealth. {#12:8}

Return again with nourishment; Agni, again with food and
life. Again preserve us from distress. {#12:9}

Agni, return with store of wealth. Swell with thine overflowing
stream that feedeth all on every side. {#12:10}

I brought thee: thou hast entered in. Stand stedfast and
immovable.
Lot all the people long for thee. Let not thy kingship fall
away. {#12:11}

Varuna, from the upmost bond release us, let down the
lowest and remove the midmost.
So in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O
thou Āditya. {#12:12}

[pg 102]

High hath the Mighty risen before the Mornings, and come
to us with light from out the darkness.
Fair-shapen Agni with white-shining splendour hath filled
at birth all human habitations. {#12:13}

The Hamsa homed in light, the Vasu in mid-air, the Priest
beside the altar, Guest within the house,
Dweller in noblest place, mid men, in truth, in sky, born
of flood, kine, truth, mountain, he is holy Law. The Great. {#12:14}

Knowing all holy ordinances, Agni, be seated in the lap of
this thy mother.
Do not with heat or glowing flame consume her: shine thou
within her with refulgent lustre. {#12:15}

Within this Fire-pan with thy light, O Agni, in thy proper seat,
Glowing with warmth, be gracious thou, O Jātavedas, unto her. {#12:16}

Being propitious unto me, O Agni, sit propitiously.
Having made all the regions blest, in thine own dwelling
seat thyself. {#12:17}

First Agni sprang to life from out of heaven, the second
time from us came Jātavedas.
Thirdly the Manly-souled was in the waters. The pious
lauds and kindles him Eternal. {#12:18}

Agni, we know thy three powers in three stations, we know
thy forms in many a place divided.
We know what name supreme thou hast in secret: we know
the source from which thou hast proceeded. {#12:19}

The Manly-souled lit thee in sea and waters, Man's Viewer
lit thee in the breast of heaven.
There as thou stoodest in the third high region the Bulls
increased thee in the waters’ bosom. {#12:20}

[pg 103]

Agni roared out, etc. (verse 6 repeated). {#12:21}

The spring of glories and support of riches, rouser of
thoughts and guardian of the Soma,
Good Son of Strength, a King amid the waters, in forefront
of the Dawns he shines enkindled. {#12:22}

Germ of the world, ensign of all creation, he sprang to life
and filled the earth and heaven.
Even the firm rock he cleft when passing over, when the
Five Tribes brought sacrifice to Agni. {#12:23}

So among mortals was immortal Agni stablished as cleansing,
wise, and eager envoy.
He waves the red smoke that he lifts above him, striving
to reach the heaven with radiant lustre. {#12:24}

Far hath he shone, etc. (verse 1 repeated). {#12:25}

Whoso this day, O God whose flames are lovely, makes thee
a cake, O Agni, mixed with butter,
Lead thou and further him to higher fortune, to bliss bestowed
by Gods, O thou Most Youthful. {#12:26}

Endow him, Agni, with a share of glory, at every, song of
praise sung forth enrich him.
Dear let him be to Sūrya, dear to Agni, preëminent with son
and children's children. {#12:27}

While, Agni, day by day men pay thee worship they win
themselves all treasures worth the wishing.
Allied with thee, eager and craving riches, they have disclosed
the stable filled with cattle. {#12:28}

Agni, man's gracious Friend, the Soma's keeper, Vaisvānara,
hath been lauded by the Rishis.
We will invoke benignant Earth and Heaven: ye Deities,
give us wealth with hero children. {#12:29}

Pay service unto Agni with your fuel, rouse your Guest
with oil:
In him present your offerings. {#12:30}

[pg 104]

May all the Gods, O Agni, bear thee upward with their earnest
thoughts:
Not to be looked on, rich in light, be thou propitious unto us, {#12:31}

Agni, go forth resplendent, thou with thine auspicious flames
of fire.
Shining with mighty beams of light harm not my people
with thy form. {#12:32}

Agni roared out, etc. (verse 21 repeated.) {#12:33}

Far famed is this the Bharata's own Agni: he shineth like
the Sun with lofty splendour.
He who hath vanquished Pūru in the battle, the heavenly
Guest hath shone for us benignly. {#12:34}

Receive these ashes, ye celestial Waters, and lay them in a
fair place full of fragrance.
To him bow down the nobly-wedded Matrons! Bear this on
waters as her son a mother. {#12:35}

Agni, thy home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest
way,
And as their child art born anew. {#12:36}

Thou art the offspring of the plants, thou art the offspring
of the trees:
The offspring thou of all that is, thou, Agni, art the Waters’
Child, {#12:37}

With ashes having reached the womb, the waters, Agni
and the earth,
United with the mothers, thou blazing hast seated thee again. {#12:38}

Seated again upon thy seat, the waters, Agni! and the earth,
In her, thou, most auspicious One, liest as in a mother's lap {#12:39}

[pg 105]

40, 41 Return again, etc. Agni, return, etc. (verses 9 and 10
repeated).

Mark this my speech, Divine One, thou Most Youthful,
offered to thee by him who gives most freely:
One hates thee, and another sings thy praises. I thine
adorer laud thy form, O Agni. {#12:42}

Be thou for us a liberal Prince, Giver and Lord of precious
things.
Drive those who hate us far away.
To the Omnific One All-hail! {#12:43}

Again let the Ādityas, Rudras, Yams, and Brahmans with
their rites light thee, Wealth-bringer!
Increase thy body with presented butter: effectual be the
Sacrificer's wishes. {#12:14}

Go hence, depart, creep off in all directions, both ancient
visitors and recent comers:
Yama hath given a place on earth to rest in. This place
for him the Fathers have provided. {#12:45}

Knowledge art thou: accomplishment of wishes. In me be
the fulfilment of thy wishes.
Thou art the ashes, thou the mould of Agni. Rankers are
ye, rankers around. Rankers right upward, be ye fixed. {#12:46}

[pg 106]

This is that Agni where the longing Indra took the pressed
Soma deep within his body.
Winner of spoils in thousands like a courser, with prayer art
thou exalted, Jātavedas. {#12:47}

The splendour which is thine in heaven, O Agni, in earth, O
Holy One, in plants, in waters,
Wherewith thou hast o’erspread mid-air's broad region, that
light is brilliant, billowy, man-surveying. {#12:48}

O Agni, to the flood of heaven thou mountest, thou tallest
hither Gods, the thought-inspirers.
The waters, those beyond the light of Sūrya, and those
that are beneath it here, approach thee. {#12:49}

May the Purīshya Agnis in accord with those that spring
from floods,
May they, benevolent, accept the sacrifice, full, wholesome
draughts. {#12:50}

As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker give wealth in cattle,
lasting, rich in marvels.
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this
thy gracious will to us-ward. {#12:51}

This is thine ordered place of birth whence, sprung to life,
thou shonest forth.
Knowing this, Agni, mount on high and cause our riches to
increase. {#12:52}

Ranker art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that Deity.
Ranker-round art thou: Angiras-like sit steady with that
Deity. {#12:53}

[pg 107]

Fill up the room, supply the void, then settle steady in thy
place.
Indr-Āgni and Brihaspati have set thee down in this abode. {#12:54}

The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught
of Soma juice—
Clans in the birthplace of the Gods, in the three luminous
realms of heaven. {#12:55}

All sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea,
The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord
of Strength. {#12:56}

Combine ye two and harmonize together, dear to each other,
brilliant, friendly-minded,
Abiding in one place for food and vigour. {#12:57}

Together have I brought your minds, your ordinances, and
your thoughts.
Be thou our Sovran Lord, Agni Purīshya; give food and
vigour to the Sacrificer. {#12:58}

Thou art Purīshya Agni, thou art wealthy, thou art prosperous.
Having made all the regions blest, here seat thee in thine
own abode. {#12:59}

Be ye one-minded unto us, both of one thought, free from
deceit.
Harm not the sacrifice, harm not the Patron of the sacrifice.
Be gracious unto us to-day, ye knowers of all things that be. {#12:60}

Even as a mother bears her son, Earth, Ukhā hath borne
within her womb Purīshya Agni.
Maker of all, accordant with the All-Gods and Seasons, may
Prajāpati release her. {#12:61}

Seek him who pours not, offers not oblation; follow the
going of the thief and robber.[pg 108]
This is thy way; leave us and seek some other. To thee,
O Goddess Nirriti, be homage. {#12:62}

To thee, sharp-pointed Nirriti, full homage! Loose and
detach this iron bond that binds him.
Unanimous with Yama and with Yamī to the sublimest
vault of heaven uplift him. {#12:63}

Thou, Awful One, thou in whose mouth I offer for the unloosing
of these binding fetters,
Whom people hail as Earth with their glad voices, as Nirriti
in every place I know thee. {#12:64}

The binding noose which Nirriti the Goddess hath fastened
on thy neck that none may loose it,
I loose for thee as from the midst of Āyus. Sped forward
now, eat thou the food we offer:
To Fortune, her who hath done this, be homage. {#12:65}

Establisher, the gatherer of treasures, he looks with might
on every form and figure.
Like Savitar the God whose laws are constant, like Indra,
he hath stood where meet the pathways. {#12:66}

Wise, through desire of bliss with Gods, the skilful bind the
traces fast, and lay the yokes on either side. {#12:67}

Lay on the yokes and fasten well the traces; formed is the
furrow sow the seed within it.
Through song may we find hearing fraught with plenty:
near to the ripened grain approach the sickle. {#12:68}

[pg 109]

Happily let the shares turn up the ploughland, happily go
the ploughers with the oxen!
Suna and Sīra, pleased with our oblation, cause ye our
plants to bear abundant fruitage. {#12:69}

Approved by Visvedevas and by Maruts, balmed be the
furrow with sweet-flavoured fatness.
Succulent, teeming with thy milky treasure, turn hitherward
to us with milk, O Furrow. {#12:70}

The keen-shared plough that bringeth bliss, good for the
Soma-drinker's need,
Shear out for me a cow, a sheep, a rapid drawer of the car,
a blooming woman, plump and strong! {#12:71}

Milk out their wish, O Wishing-Cow, to Mitra and to Varuna,
To Indra, to the Asvins, to Pūshan, to people and to plants. {#12:72}

Be loosed, inviolable, Godward-farers! We have attained
the limit of this darkness: we have won the light. {#12:73}

The year together with the darksome fortnights; Dawn with
the ruddy-coloured cows about her; the Asvins with
their wonderful achievements; the Sun together with his
dappled Courser; Vaisvānara with Idā and with butter.
Svāhā! {#12:71}

Herbs that sprang up in time of old, three ages earlier than
the Gods,—
Of these, whose hue is brown, will I declare the hundred
powers and seven. {#12:75}

[pg 110]

Ye, Mothers, have a hundred homes, yea, and a thousand are
your growths.
Do ye who have a thousand powers free this my patient from
disease. {#12:76}

Be glad and joyful in the Plants, both blossoming and bearing
fruit,
Plants that will lead us to success like mares who conquer in
the race. {#12:77}

Plants, by this name I speak to you, Mothers, to you the
Goddesses:
Steed, cow, and garment may I win, win back thy very self,
O man. {#12:78}

The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna
tree:
Winners of cattle shall ye be if ye regain for me this man. {#12:79}

He who hath store of Herbs at hand like Kings amid a crowd
of men,—
Physician is that sage's name, fiend-slayer, chaser of disease. {#12:80}

Herbs rich in Soma, rich in steeds, in nourishment in strengthening
power,
All these have I provided here, that this man may be whole
again. {#12:81}

The healing virtues of the Plants stream forth like cattle
from the stall,—
Plants that shall win me store of wealth, and save thy vital
breath, O man. {#12:82}

Reliever is your mother's name, and hence Restorers are ye
called.
Rivers are ye with wings that fly: keep far whatever brings
disease. {#12:83}

Over all fences have they passed, as steals a thief into the fold.
The Plants have driven from the frame whatever malady was
there. {#12:84}

When, bringing back the vanished strength, I hold these herbs
within my hand,
The spirit of disease departs ere he can seize upon the life. {#12:85}

He through whose frame, O Plants, ye creep member by
member, joint by joint,
From him ye drive away disease like some strong arbiter of
strife. {#12:86}

Fly, Spirit of Disease, begone, with the blue jay and kingfisher.
Fly, with the wind's impetuous speed, vanish together with
the storm. {#12:87}

[pg 111]

Help every one the other, lend assistance each of you to
each,
All of you be accordant, give furtherance to this speech of
mine. {#12:88}

Let fruitful Plants, and fruitless, those that blossom, and
the blossomless,
Urged onward by Brihaspati, release us from our pain and
grief; {#12:89}

Release me from the curse's plague and woe that comes from
Varuna;
Free me from Yama's fetter, from sin and offence against the
Gods. {#12:90}

What time, descending from the sky, the Plants flew earthward,
thus they spake:
No evil shall befall the man whom while he liveth we
pervade. {#12:91}

Of all the many Plants whose King is Soma, Plants of hundred
forms,
Thou art the Plant most excellent, prompt to the wish, sweet
to the heart. {#12:92}

O all ye various Herbs whose King is Soma, that o’erspread
the earth,
Urged onward by Brihaspati, combine your virtue in this
Plant. {#12:93}

All Plants that hear this speech, and those that have
departed far away,
Come all assembled and confer your healing power upon
this Herb. {#12:94}

Unharmed be he who digs you up, unharmed the man for
whom I dig:
And let no malady attack biped or quadruped of ours. {#12:95}

With Soma as their Sovran Lord the Plants hold colloquy
and say:
O King, we save from death the man whose cure a Brāhman
undertakes. {#12:96}

Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant: thy vassals are the
trees.
Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to
injure us. {#12:97}

Banisher of catarrh art thou, of tumours and of hemorrhoids;
Thou banished Pākāru and Consumption in a hundred
forms. {#12:98}

[pg 112]

Thee did Gandharvas dig from earth, thee Indra and
Brihaspati.
King Soma, knowing thee, O Plant, from his Consumption
was made free. {#12:99}

Conquer mine enemies, the men who challenge me do thou
subdue.
Conquer thou all unhappiness: victorious art thou, O Plant. {#12:100}

Long-lived be he who digs thee, Plant, and he for whom I
dig thee up.
So mayst thou also, grown long-lived, rise upward with a
hundred shoots. {#12:101}

Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant; thy vassals are the
trees.
Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to
injure us. {#12:102}

May he not harm me who is earth's begetter, nor he whose
laws are faithful, sky's pervades;
Nor he who first begot the lucid waters. To Ka the God
let us present oblation. {#12:103}

Turn thyself hitherward, O Earth, to us with sacrifice and
milk.
Thy covering skin Agni, urged forth, hath mounted. {#12:104}

All, Agni, that in thee is bright, pure, cleansed, and meet
for sacrifice,
That do we bring unto the Gods. {#12:105}

I from this place have fed on strength and vigour, the
womb of holy Law, stream of the mighty.
In cows let it possess me and in bodies. I quit decline and
lack of food, and sickness. {#12:106}

Agni, life-power and fame are thine: thy fires blaze mightily,
thou rich in wealth of beams!
Sage, passing bright, thou givest to the worshipper, with
strength, the food that merits laud. {#12:107}

With brilliant, purifying sheen, with perfect sheen thou
liftest up thyself in light.
Thou, visiting both thy Mothers, aidest them as Son: thou
joinest close the earth and heaven. {#12:108}

[pg 113]

O Jātavedas, Son of Strength, rejoice thyself, gracious, in
our fair hymns and songs.
In thee are treasured various forms of strengthening food,
born nobly and of wondrous help. {#12:109}

Agni, spread forth, as Ruler, over living things: give wealth
to us, Immortal God.
Thou shinest out from beauty fair to look upon: thou
leadest us to conquering power. {#12:110}

To him, the wise, who orders sacrifice, who hath great riches
under his control,
Thou givest blest award of good, and plenteous food, givest
him wealth that conquers all. {#12:111}

The men have set before them for their welfare Agni, strong,
visible to all, the Holy.
Thee, Godlike One, with ears to hear, most famous, men's
generations magnify with praise-songs. {#12:112}

Soma, wax great. From every side may vigorous powers
unite in thee.
Be in the gathering-place of strength. {#12:113}

In thee be juicy nutriments united, and power and mighty
foe-subduing vigour.
Waxing to immortality, O Soma, win highest glory for
thyself in heaven. {#12:114}

Wax, O most gladdening Soma, great through all thy
filaments, and be
A friend of most illustrious fame to prosper us. {#12:115}

May Vatsa draw thy mind away, even from thy loftiest
dwelling-place,
Agni, with song that yearns for thee. {#12:116}

Agni, best Angiras, to thee all people who have pleasant
homes
Apart have turned to gain their wish. {#12:117}

In dear homes, Agni, the desire of all that is and is to be,
Shines forth the One Imperial Lord. {#12:118}

[pg 114]

## BOOK THE THIRTEENTH {#13}

I TAKE within me Agni first, for increase of my wealth,
good offspring, manly strength:
So may the Deities wait on me.

Thou art the waters’ back, the womb of Agni, around the
ocean as it swells and surges.
Waxing to greatness, resting on the lotus, spread forth in
amplitude with heaven's own measure. {#13:2}

Eastward at first was Brahma generated. Vena o’erspread
the bright Ones from the summit,
Disclosed his deepest nearest revelations, womb of existent
and of non-existent. {#13:3}

In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all
created being.
He fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. Worship
we Ka the God with our oblation. {#13:4}

The Drop leaped onward through the earth and heaven,
along this place and that which was before it.[pg 115]
I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop still
moving to the common dwelling. {#13:5}

Homage be paid to Serpents unto all of them that are on
earth,
To those that dwell in air, to those that dwell in sky be
homage paid. {#13:6}

To those that are the demons’ darts, to those that live upon
the trees,
To all the Serpents that lie low in holes be adoration paid. {#13:7}

Or those that are in heaven's bright sphere, or those that
dwell in the Sun's beams:
Serpents, whose home has been prepared in waters, homage
unto them! {#13:8}

Put forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour: go like a
mighty King with his attendants.
Thou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the
fiends with darts that burn most fiercely. {#13:9}

Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them
closely glowing in thy fury.
Spread with thy tongue the wingèd flames, O Agni: unfettered
cast thy firebrands all around thee. {#13:10}

Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion: be, ne’er
deceived, the guardian of this people
From him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no
trouble sent from thee o’ercome us. {#13:11}

Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us, burn down our
foes, thou who hast sharpened arrows.
Him, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume
thou utterly like dried-up stubble. {#13:12}

Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make
manifest thine own celestial vigour.
Slacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our
foemen whether kin or stranger.
I settle thee with Agni's fiery ardour. {#13:13}

[pg 116]

Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth
is he:
He quickeneth the waters’ seed.
I settle thee with the great strength of Indra. {#13:14}

Thou art the leader of the rite and region to which with
thine auspicious teams thou tendest.
Thy light-bestowing head to heaven thou liftest, making
thy tongue the oblation-bearer, Agni! {#13:15}

Steady art thou, sustainer, laid by Visvakarman in thy
place.
Let not the ocean nor the bird harm thee: unshaking, steady
earth. {#13:16}

Thee let Prajāpati settle on the waters’ back, in Ocean's
course,
Thee the capacious, widely spread. Thou art the Wide
One: spread thee wide {#13:17}

Thou art the earth, the ground, thou art the all-sustaining
Aditi, she who supporteth all the world.
Control the earth, steady the earth, do thou the earth no
injury. {#13:18}

For all breath, out-breath; through-breath, upward-breathing,
for high position, for prescribed observance,
May Agni keep thee safe with great well-being, with the
securest shelter. As aforetime with Angiras, with that
Deity lie steady. {#13:19}

Upspringing from thine every joint, upspringing from each
knot of thine,[pg 117]
Thus with a thousand, Dūrvā! with a hundred do thou
stretch us out. {#13:20}

Thou spreading with a hundred, thou that branched with
a thousand shoots,
Thee, such, with our oblation will we worship, O celestial
Brick. {#13:21}

Thy lights, O Agni, in the Sun that with their beams
o’erspread the sky,—
With all of those assist thou us to-day to light and progeny. {#13:22}

23\. Lights of yours in the Sun, O Gods, or lights that are in
kine and steeds,
O Indra-Agni, with all those vouchsafe us light, Brihaspati!

The Far.-Refulgent held the light. The Self-Refulgent held
the light.
Thee, luminous, may Prajāpati settle upon the back of Earth.
Give, to all breathing, all the light, to out-breath, to diffusive
breath.
Thy Sovran Lord is Agni. With that Deity, as with Angiras,
lie firmly settled in thy place. {#13:24}

Madhu and Mādhava, the two Spring seasons—thou art
the innermost cement of Agni.
May Heaven and Earth, may Waters, Plants and Agnis
help, separate, accordant, my precedence.
May all the Fires ’twixt heaven and earth, one-minded,
well-fitted, gather round these two Spring seasons,
As the Gods gathering encompass Indra: firm with that
Deity, Angiras-like, be seated. {#13:25}

Thou art Ashādhā, Conquering One. Conquer our foemen,
conquer thou the men who fain would-fight with us.
A thousand manly powers hast thou: so do thou aid and
quicken me. {#13:26}

[pg 118]

The winds waft sweets, the rivers pour sweets for the man
who keeps the Law:
So may the plants be sweet for us. {#13:27}

Sweet be the night and sweet the dawns, sweet the terrestrial
atmosphere:
Sweet be our Father Heaven to us. {#13:28}

May the tall tree be full of sweets for us and, and full of
sweets the Sun:
May our milch-kine be sweet for us. {#13:29}

Seat thyself in the deepness of the waters, lest Sūrya, lest
Vaisvānara Agni scorch thee.
With wing unclipped, survey created beings: may rain
that cometh down from heaven attend thee. {#13:30}

He crept across the three heaven-reaching oceans, the Bull
of Bricks, the Master of the Waters.
Clad in the world with his, the Well-Made's, vesture, go
whither those before thee have departed. {#13:31}

May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, besprinkle this our
sacrifice,
And feed us full with nourishments. {#13:32}

Look ye on Vishnu's works whereby the Friend of Indra,
close allied,
Hath let his holy ways be seen. {#13:33}

[pg 119]

Firm art thou, a sustainer. Hence engendered, forth from
these wombs at first came Jātavedas.
By Gāyatrī, by Trishtup, by Anushtup, may he who knows
bear to the Gods oblation. {#13:34}

Take thou thine ease for food, for store of riches, for might
in splendour, and for strength and offspring.
Thou art all-ruling, independent Ruler: both fountains of
Sarasvatī protect thee! {#13:35}

O radiant Agni, harness thou thy steeds which are most excellent!
They bear thee as thy spirit wills. {#13:36}

Yoke, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invoke the
Gods:
As ancient Hotar take thy seat. {#13:37}

Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves
in inmost heart and spirit.
I look upon the flowing streams of butter: the golden reed
is in the midst of Agni. {#13:38}

Thee for the praise-verse, thee for sheen, thee for bright
splendour, thee for light.
This hath become the energetic spirit of all the world and of
Vaisvānara Agni. {#13:39}

Agni, all-luminous with light, splendid with splendour, golden
One.
Giver of thousands art thou: for a thousand thee. {#13:40}

[pg 120]

Balm thou with milk the unborn babe Āditya, wearing all
forms, creator of a thousand.
Spare, him with heat, nor plot against him: give him a
hundred years of life while thou art building. {#13:41}

The wind's impetuous rush, Varuna's navel! the horse that
springs to life amid the waters!
The rivers’ tawny child, based on the mountain, harm not,
O Agni, in the loftiest region. {#13:42}

Unwasting Drop, red, eager, pressing forward, Agni I worship
with repeated homage.
Forming thyself with joints in proper order, harm not the
Cow, Aditi widely ruling! {#13:43}

Her who is Tvashtar's guardian, Varuna's navel, the Ewe
brought forth from out the loftiest region,
The Asura's mighty thousandfold contrivance, injure not in
the highest sphere, O Agni. {#13:44}

The Agni who from Agni had his being, from heat of Earth
or also heat of Heaven,
Whereby the Omnific One engendered creatures, him may
thy fierce displeasure spare, O Agni. {#13:45}

The brilliant presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of
Mitra, Varuna, and Agni.
The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the Sun hath
filled the air, and earth and heaven. {#13:46}

Injure not, thousand-eyed, while thou art building for sacrifice,
this animal, the biped.[pg 121]
Accept as pith man's counterfeit the victim, Agni: therewith
building thy forms, be settled.
Let thy flame reach man's counterfeit: let thy flame reach
the man we hate. {#13:47}

Harm not this animal whose hooves are solid, the courser
neighing in the midst of coursers.
I dedicate to thee the forest Gaura: building thy bodies up
with him be settled.
Let thy flame reach the Gaura, let thy flame reach him whom
we detest. {#13:48}

Thousandfold, with a hundred streams, this fountain,
expanded in the middle of the waters,
Infinite, yielding butter for the people, harm not, O Agni,
in the highest region.
This wild bull of the forest I assign thee: building thy
bodies up therewith be settled.
Let thy flame reach the wild hull, etc. (as in 48). {#13:49}

This creature clothed in wool, Varuna's navel, the skin of
animals quadruped and biped,
The first that was produced of Tvashtar's creatures, O Agni,
harm not in the highest region.
The forest buffalo do I assign thee: building, etc., as above
*mutato mutando*. {#13:50}

From Agni's warmth the he-goat had his being: he looked
at first upon his generator.
Thereby the Gods at first attained to Godhead: those meet
for worship to the height ascended.
The forest Sarabha do I assign thee: building, etc. {#13:51}

Do thou, Most Youthful God, protect the men who offer,
hear their songs,
Protect his offspring and himself. {#13:52}

[pg 122]

swelling of the waters. I set thee in the ashes of the
waters. I set thee in the lustre of the waters. I set

the offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow. {#15:47}

O Agni, be our nearest Friend, be thou a kind deliverer and
a gracious Friend.
Come as good Agni, come as excellent and give us wealth
most splendidly renowned.

prayer for happiness for our friends. {#15:48}

[pg 138]

With what devotion, winning light, the Rishis came, kindling
Agni, to the Holy session,
Even with that in heaven I stablish Agni whom men call
him whose sacred grass is scattered. {#15:49}

Gods, let us follow him with wives beside us, with sons, with
brothers, with our gold adornments,
Grasping the sky up in the world of virtue, on the third
height, the luminous realm of heaven. {#15:50}

This Agni mounted up to Speech's Centre, Lord of the
Brave, observant, ever-active.
Laid on the back of Earth, may he, resplendent, cast under
foot those who would fight against us. {#15:51}

May this most manly Agni, strength-bestower, giver of thousands,
shine with care that fails not.
Resplendent in the middle of the water, make thine approach
to the celestial mansions. {#15:52}

Make him go forth from all sides: meet, Approach ye. O
Agni, make the paths for Godward travel.
Making the Parents young with life's renewal, the out spun
thread in thee have they extended. {#15:53}

Wake up, O Agni, thou, and keep him watchful. Wish and
fruition, meet, and he, together.
In this and in the loftier habitation be seated, All-Gods!
and the Sacrificer. {#15:54}

Convey our sacrifice to heaven that it may reach the God
with that[pg 139]
Whereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands and all
precious things. {#15:55}

56 This is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life
thou shonest forth.
Knowing this, Agni, rise thou up and cause our riches to
increase. {#15:6}

Tapa, Tapasya, pair of Dewy Seasons: thou art, etc. (as
in XIII. 25). {#15:57}

On the sky's back may Parameshthin lay thee, etc. (as in

Like a horse neighing, eager for the pasture, when he hath
stepped forth from the great enclosure:
Then the wind following blows upon his splendour, and,
straight, the path is black which thou hast travelled. {#15:62}

In Āyu's seat I set thee, in the shadow of the protector in
the heart of Ocean,
Thee luminous, bright with eyes, thee who illumest the sky,
the earth, and air's broad realm between them. {#15:63}

On the sky's back may Parameshthin set thee, etc. (as in
XIV. 12, substituting sky for air and Sūrya for Vāyu). {#15:64}

Thou art the measure of a thousand. Thou art the representative
of a thousand. Thou art the equivalent of a thousand. Thou art
worth a thousand. Thee for a thousand. {#15:65}

Let thy shot missiles burn others than us: be thou cleanser,
propitious unto us. {#17:11}

To him who dwells in man, Hail! To him who dwells in
waters, Hail!
To him who dwells in sacred grass, Hail! To him who dwells
in the wood, Hail! To him who finds the light, Hail! {#17:12}

[pg 150]

Worshipful Gods of Gods who merit worship, those who sit
down beside their yearly portion,
Let them who eat not sacrificial presents drink in this rite
of honey and of butter. {#17:13}

Those Gods who have attained to Godhead over Gods, they
who have led the way in this our holy work,
Without whose aid no body whatsoever moves, not on heaven's
heights are they, nor on the face of earth. {#17:14}

Giver of breath, of out-breath, breath diffusive, giver of
lustre, giving room and freedom,
Let thy shot missiles burn others than us: be thou cleanser,
propitious unto us. {#17:15}

May Agni with his sharpened blaze cast down each fierce
devouring fiend.
May Agni win us wealth by war. {#17:16}

He who sate down as Hotar priest, the Rishi, our Father
offering, up all things existent
He, seeking with his wish a great possession, came among
men on earth as archetypal. {#17:17}

What was the place whereon he took his station? What was
it that upheld him? What the manner,
Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with
mighty power disclosed the heavens? {#17:18}

[pg 151]

He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on
all sides, arms and feet on all sides,
He the sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them
with his arms as wings together. {#17:19}

What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from
which they fashioned out the earth and heaven?
Ye thoughtful men, inquire within your spirit whereon he
stood when he established all things. {#17:20}

Thine highest, lowest sacrificial natures, and these thy
midmost here, O Visvakarman,
Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessèd, and come thy-
self, exalted, to our worship. {#17:21}

Bring those, thyself exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman,
Earth and Heaven to worship.
Let enemies around us live in folly: here let us have a rich
and liberal patron. {#17:22}

23, 24. = VIII. 45, 46.

The Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these
worlds submerged in fatness.
Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens
and the earth were far extended. {#17:25}

Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer,
and most lofty Presence.[pg 152]
Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only
One beyond the Seven Rishis. {#17:26}

Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races
and all things existing,
Even he alone, the Deities’ name-giver,—him other beings
seek for information. {#17:27}

To him in sacrifice they offered treasures,—Rishis of old, in
numerous troops, as singers,
Who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all
these things that have existence. {#17:28}

That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the
Asuras and Gods had being,
What was the germ primeval which the waters received where
the first Gods beheld each other? {#17:29}

The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the
Gods were gathered all together.
It rested set upon the Unborn's navel, that One wherein abide
all things existing. {#17:30}

Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another
thing hath risen up among you.
Enwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymn-chanters
wander and are discontented. {#17:31}

First was the God engendered, Visvakarman: then the
Gandharva sprang to life as second.
Third in succession was the plants’ begetter: he laid the
waters’ germ in many places. {#17:32}

Swift, rapidly striking, like a bull who sharpens his horns,
terrific, stirring up the people,
With eyes that close not, bellowing, Sole Hero, Indra subdued
at once a hundred armies. {#17:33}

[pg 153]

With him loud-roaring, ever watchful, Victor, bold, hard to
overthrow, Rouser of battle,
Indra the Strong, whose hand bears arrows, conquer, ye
warriors, now, now vanquish in the combat. {#17:34}

He rules with those who carry shafts and quivers, Indra who
with his band brings hosts together,
Foe-conquering, strong of arm, the Soma-drinker, with mighty
bow, shooting with well-laid arrows. {#17:35}

Brihaspati, fly with thy chariot hither, slayer of demons,
driving off our foemen.
Be thou protector of our cars, destroyer, victor in battle,
breaker-up of armies. {#17:36}

Conspicuous by thy strength, firm, foremost fighter, mighty
and fierce, victorious, all-subduing,
The Son of Conquest, passing men and heroes, kine-winner,
mount thy conquering car, O Indra. {#17:37}

Cleaver of stalls, kine-winner, armed with thunder, who quells
an army and with might destroys it,
Follow him, brothers! quit yourselves like heroes, and like
this Indra show your zeal and courage. {#17:38}

Piercing the cow-stalls with surpassing vigour, Indra, the
pitiless Hero, wild with anger,
Victor in fight, unshaken and resistless,—may he protect our
armies in our battles. {#17:39}

Indra guide these: Brihaspati precede them, the guerdon,
and the sacrifice, and Soma;
And let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly
hosts that conquer and demolish. {#17:40}

Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna, and
Maruts, and Ādityas.
Uplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, high-minded Gods
who cause the worlds to tremble. {#17:41}

Bristle thou up, O Bounteous Lord, our weapons: excite the
spirits of my warring heroes.
Urge on the strong steeds’ might, O Vritra-slayer, and let the
din of conquering cars go upward. {#17:42}

May Indra aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be
the arrows of our army.
May our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Gods protect
us in the shout of onset. {#17:43}

[pg 154]

Bewildering the senses of our foemen, seize thou their bodies
and depart, O Apvā.
Attack them, set their hearts on fire and burn them: so let
our foes abide in utter darkness. {#17:44}

Loosed from the bowstring fly awry, O Arrow, sharpened by
our prayer.
Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one of
them escape. {#17:45}

Advance, O heroes, win the day. May Indra be your sure
defence.
Exceeding mighty be your arms, that none may wound or
injure you. {#17:46}

That army of our enemies, O Maruts, that comes against
us with its might, contending,
Meet ye and wrap it in unwelcome darkness so that not one
of them may know another. {#17:47}

There where the flights of arrows fall like boys whose locks
are yet unshorn,
May Indra, may Brihaspati, may Aditi protect us well, protect
us well through all our days. {#17:48}

Thy vital parts I cover with thine armour: with immortality
King Soma clothe thee.
Varuna give thee what is more than ample, and in thy
triumph may the Gods be joyful. {#17:49}

Worshipped with butter, Agni, lead this man to high
preeminence.
Vouchsafe him growth of riches and multiply him with
progeny. {#17:50}

[pg 155]

Indra, lead him to eminence: controller of his foes be he.
Vouchsafe him lustre: let him give their sacred portions to
the Gods. {#17:51}

The man within whose house we pay oblation, Indra, prosper
him.
May the Gods bless and comfort him, they and this
Brahmanaspati. {#17:52}

May the All-Gods, O Agni, bear and lift thee upward with
their thoughts.
Fair to be looked on, rich in light, he thou propitious unto
us. {#17:53}

May the Five Regions guard, divine, our worship, Goddesses
chasing lack of thought and hatred,
Giving the Sacrificer growth of riches. Let sacrifice be based
on growth of riches. {#17:54}

Inspirited above enkindled Agni, adorable, winged with
hymns, was it accepted,
When the Gods offered sacrifice with viands, circling the
heated caldron, paving worship. {#17:55}

Lord of a hundred draughts. benign, God-serving—to him
divine, establisher, protector,
The Gods approached the sacrifice, encircling. Gods for the
Gods stood fain for sacred service. {#17:56}

When the fourth sacrifice reaches the oblation, accepted offering
which hath been made ready, fit for the Inmolator's
sacrificing,
Thence bless us prayers and holy recitations! {#17:57}

Savitar, golden-hued, hath lifted eastward, bright with the
sunbeams, his eternal lustre,
He at whose furtherance wise Pūshan marches surveying all
existence like a herdsman. {#17:58}

[pg 156]

He sits, the measurer, in the midst of heaven, filling the two
world-halves and air's mid-region.
He looks upon the rich far-spreading pastures between the
eastern and the western limit. {#17:59}

Steer, Sea, Red Bird with strong wings, he hath entered the
dwelling-place of the Primeval Father.
A gay-hued Stone set in the midst of heaven, he hath gone
forth and guards the air's two limits. {#17:60}

All sacred songs have glorified Indra expansive as the sea,
The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the Very Lord
of strength. {#17:61}

May God-invoking sacrifice bring the Gods hitherward to us.
May bless-invoking sacrifice bring the Gods hitherward to us.
May Agni, God, make offering and hither bring the Gods to
us. {#17:62}

May the abundant growth of wealth with elevation lift me
up,
And with his subjugating power may Indra keep my foemen
down. {#17:63}

Upraising and depression and devotion may the Gods increase.
May Indra, too, and Agni drive my foes away to every side. {#17:64}

Go ye by Agni to the sky bearing the Ukhya in your hands.
Reaching the heights of sky and heaven stay intermingled
with the Gods. {#17:65}

Agni, go forward to the eastern region, well-skilled, be here
the fire in front of Agni.
Illuming all the quarters, shine with splendour: supply with
food our quadrupeds and bipeds. {#17:66}

[pg 157]

From earth to air's mid-region have I mounted, and from
mid-air ascended up to heaven.
From the high pitch of heaven's cope I came into the world
of light. {#17:67}

Mounting the sky they look not round: they rise to heaven
through both the worlds—
Sages who span the sacrifice that pours its stream on every side. {#17:68}

Foremost of those who seek the Gods come forward, thou
who art eye of Gods and men, O Agni.
Accordant with the Bhrigus, fain to worship, to heaven in
safety go the Sacrificers. {#17:69}

Night and Dawn, different in hue, accordant, etc., as in XII. 2. {#17:70}

O Agni, thousand-eyed and hundred-headed, thy breaths are
hundred, thy through-breaths a thousand.
Thou art the Lord of thousandfold possessions. To thee;
for strength, may we present oblation. {#17:71}

Thou art the Bird of goodly wing: be seated on the ridge
of earth.
Fill air's mid-region with thy glow, supporting with thy
light the sky, confirm the quarters with thy sheen. {#17:72}

Receiving offerings, fair of aspect, eastward be duly seated
in thy place, O Agni.
In this the more exalted habitation be seated All-Gods and
the Sacrificer. {#17:73}

That wondrous all-mankind-embracing favour of Savitar,
choice-worthy, I solicit,
Even his which Kanva wont to milk, the mighty, the teeming
Cow who yields a thousand milk-streams. {#17:74}

[pg 158]

May we adore thee in thy loftiest birth place, Agni! with
praise-songs in thy lower station.
The place whence those hast issued forth I worship. In thee,
well kindled, have they paid oblations {#17:75}

Shine thou before us, Agni, well enkindled, with flame, most
youthful God, that never fadeth.
Unceasing unto thee come sacred viands. {#17:76}

Agni, this day with lands, etc., as in XV. 44. {#17:77}

I dedicate the thought with mind and butter so that the
Gods may come who love oblation, strengthing Law,
To Visvakarman, Lord of all the earth, I offer up day after
day the inviolable sacrifice. {#17:78}

Seven fuel logs hast thou, seven tongues, O Agni, seven Rishis
hast thou, seven belovèd mansions.
Seven-priests in sevenfold manner pay thee worship. Fill
full—All-hail to thee!—seven wombs with butter. {#17:79}

Purely-Bright, Wonderfully-Bright, Really-Bright,
All-Luminous,
Bright, Law's-Protector, Safe-from-Ill; {#17:80}

Such, Other-Looking, Equal, Similar, Measured, Commensurate,
Jointly-Bearing-up. {#17:81}

Right, Real, Firm, Strong-to-Support, Bearer, Disposer,
Manager. {#17:82}

Winner-of-Right, Winner-of-Truth, Host-Conquering,
Lord-of-Goodly-Host,
Whose-Friends-are-Near-at-Hand, Whose-Banded-Enemies-are-Far-Away: {#17:83}

[pg 159]

To day in this our sacrifice be present, Such, Looking-Thus,
Same, Similar-in-appearance,
Measured, Commensurate, Joint-Bearers, Maruts! {#17:84}

Self-Powerful, Voracious-One, Kin-to-the-Sun, The
House-holder,
Play-Lover, Mighty, Conqueror.
Fierce, Terrible, The Resonant, The Roaring. Victorious,
Assailant, and Dispeller, All-Hail! {#17:85}

The Maruts, clans divine, became the followers of Indra; as
The Maruts, clans divine, became the followers of Indra, so
May clans divine and human he the Sacrificer's followers. {#17:86}

Drink in the middle of the flood, O Agni, this breast stored
full of sap, teeming with water.
Welcome this fountain redolent of sweetness. O Courser,
enter those thy watery dwelling. {#17:87}

Oil hath been mixed: oil is his habitation. In oil he rests:
oil is his proper province.
Come as thy wont is. O thou Steer, rejoice thee. Bear off
the oblation duly consecrated. {#17:88}

Forth from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together
with the stalk it turned to Amrit,
That which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Gods’
tongue is truly Amities centre. {#17:89}

Let us Declare aloud the name of Ghrita, and at this sacrifice
held it up with homage.
So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the
four-horned Buffalo emitted. {#17:90}

[pg 160]

Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him: his
heads are two, his hands are seven in number.
Bound with a triple bond the Bull roars loudly: the mighty
God hath entered into mortals. {#17:91}

That oil in triple shape the Gods discovered laid down with-
in the Cow, concealed by Panis.
Indra produced one shape, Sūrya another: by their own
power they formed the third from Vena. {#17:92}

From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down these
rivers which the foe beholds not.
I look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo! the
Golden Reed is there among them. {#17:93}

Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves
in inmost heart and spirit.
The streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the wild
beasts that fly before the bowman. {#17:94}

As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the
wind the vigorous currents,
The streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser
bursting through the fences. {#17:95}

[pg 161]

Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling,
they incline to Agni.
The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and Jātavedas joyfully
receives them. {#17:96}

As maidens deck themselves with gay adornment to join the
bridal feast, I now behold them.
Where Soma flows and sacrifice is ready, thither the streams
of holy oil are running. {#17:97}

Send to our eulogy a herd of cattle: bestow upon us excellent
possessions.
Bear to the Gods the sacrifice we offers the streams of oil flow
pure and full of sweetness. {#17:98}

The universe depends upon thy power and might within the
sea, within the heart, within all life.
May we attain that sweetly-flavoured wave of thine, brought,
at this gathering, o’er the surface of the floods. {#17:99}

Teeming with milk for me he all the regions. {#18:36}

Thee by the radiant Savitar's impulsion, with arms of Asvins,

Centre of earth, heaven's head art thou, essence of waters

Eternal, far spread refuge. Homage to the Path! {#18:54}

Attached thou standest at the head of all the world. Thy
heart is in the sea, thy life is in the floods. Give water:
cleave the reservoir.[pg 169]
Help us with rain sent from the sky, Parjanya, firmament,
or earth. {#18:55}

By Bhrigus and by Vasus hath prayer-granting sacrifice
been paid.
Come, Wealth, into the house of him our dear, our well-beloved
one. {#18:56}

May Agni, served with sacrifice and gifts, protect our offered
food:
This homage be Good-speed to Gods! {#18:57}

That which hath flowed from purpose or from judgment, or
gathered from the wind or from the vision,
Follow ye to the region of the pious whither have gone the
first-born ancient Rishis. {#18:58}

To thee I trust this man. Celestial Dwelling! treasure which
Jātavedas shall bring hither.
After you will the Sacrificer follow. Here recognize him in
the highest heaven. {#18:59}

Acknowledge him, ye Gods, in highest heaven. Ye who are
present, know the shape he weareth.
When he approacheth by the God-ward pathways, reveal to
him the meed of pious actions. {#18:60}

Wake up, O Agni, etc., as in XV. 54. {#18:61}

Convey our sacrifice to heaven, etc., as in XV. 55, {#18:62}

With Darbha-bunch, with fencing-wood, with spoon, with
altar, holy grass,
With laud, lead this our sacrifice to go to heaven among
the Gods. {#18:63}

Our gifts, our charitable grants, our pious works, our fees to
priests,
May the Omnific's Agni set all this among the Gods in heaven. {#18:64}

[pg 170]

There where all never-failing streams of honey and of butter
flow,
May Agni, Visvakarman's own, place us in heaven among
the Gods. {#18:65}

Agni am who know by birth all creatures. Mine eye is
butter, in my mouth is nectar.
I am the triple light, the region's meter: exhaustless heat
am I, named burnt oblation. {#18:66}

Praise-verses, sacrificial texts, and chanted hymns am I in name.
Thou art the best of all the Fires among the fivefold race
of man
That burn upon this earth of ours. Speed thou us on to
lengthened life. {#18:67}

O Indra, for the strength that slays Vritra and conquers in
the fight
We torn thee hitherward to us. {#18:68}

Thou, Indra, much-invoked, didst crush to pieces, Kunāru,
handless fiend who dwelt with Dānus.
Thou with might, Indra, smotest dead the scorner, the footless
Vritra as he waxed in vigour. {#18:69}

O Indra, beat our foes away, etc. as in VIII. 44. {#18:70}

Like some dread wild beast roaming on the mountain thou
hast approached us from the farthest distance.
Whetting thy bolt and thy sharp blade, O Indra, crush thou
the foes and scatter those who hate us. {#18:71}

To aid us let Vaisvānara come from the distance far away:
Come Agni, to our eulogies! {#18:72}

Sought in the sky, sought on the earth, sought after, all
plants that grow on ground hath Agni entered.
May Agni, may Vaisvānara with vigour, sought for, by day
and night from harm preserve us. {#18:73}

[pg 171]

Help its that we may gain this wish, O Agni, gain riches,
Wealthy One! with store of heroes.
Desiring strength from thee may we be strengthened, and
win, Eternal! thine eternal glory. {#18:74}

Approaching with raised hands and adoration, we have this
day fulfilled for thee thy longing.
Worship the Gods with most devoted spirit as Priest with
no unfriendly thought. O Agni. {#18:75}

Home-hider Agni, Indra, and Brahma, and bright Brihaspati—
May the All Gods, one-minded, guard our sacrifice in happy
place. {#18:76}

Guard thou the Sacrificer's men, O Youthfullest, etc., as in
XIII. 52. {#18:77}

## BOOK THE NINETEENTH. {#19}

SWEET with the sweet, I sprinkle thee with Soma, strong
with the strong, the nectar with the nectar,
The honey-sweet with what is sweet as honey.
Soma art thou. Get dressed for the Asvins. Get dressed
for Sarasvatī. Get dressed for Indra the Good Deliverer.

Hence pour ye forth the flowing juice, Soma, best Sacrificial
food.
He who, man's friend, hath run within the waters hath with
the pressing-stones poured out the Soma. {#19:2}

Purified by Vāyu's strainer, Soma that has passed away forward
is Indra's proper friend.
Purified by Vāyu's strainer, Soma that has passed away
backward is Indra's proper friend. {#19:3}

By means of this eternal sieve may Sūrya's Daughter purify
The Soma that flows forth from thee. {#19:4}

Soma with Wine, pressed; filtered for the banquet, cleanses
priest, noble, brilliancy and vigour.
God, with the Bright give Deities enjoyment: give food with
flavour to the Sacrificer. {#19:5}

[pg 173]

What then? As men whose fields are full of barley, etc., as
in X. 32.
Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee for the Asvin Pair.
Thee for Sarasvatī. Thee for Indra the Good Deliverer.
This is thy home. For splendour thee. Thee for mans’
vigour. Thee for strength. {#19:6}

For each of you is made a God-appointed place: so grant to
me a portion in the highest sphere.
Surā the strong art thou. This here is Soma. Entering
thine own place do me no mischief. {#19:7}

Taken upon a base art thou. Splendour of Asvins, Sarasvatī's
manly vigour, might of Indra.
This is thy home. I take thee for enjoyment. I take thee
for delight, take thee for greatness. {#19:8}

Thou art lustre: give me lustre, Thou art manly vigour:
give me manly vigour.
Thou art strength: give me strength. Thou art energy:
give me energy.
Thou art passion: Give me passion. Thou art conquering
might: give me conquering might. {#19:9}

My she, Vishūchikā, who guards these two, the tiger and
the wolf,
The lion and the wingèd hawk, may she guard this man
from distress. {#19:10}

When, a delighted boy, I bruised my mother as I sucked
her breast,[pg 174]
Free from my debt, O Agni, I become thereby. My parents
are by me unharmed.
United are ye all: with bliss unite me. Parted are ye, keep
me apart from evil. {#19:11}

The Asvins, the Physicians, Gods, stretched out the healing
sacrifice,
Sarasvatī with speech was a Physician, all with heroic powers
investing Indra. {#19:12}

Symbols of Dīkshā are grass buds, of Prāyanīya sprouts of
corn,
Of Soma-purchasing fried grains are symbols, Soma-shoots
and meath. {#19:13}

Ātithya's sign is Māsara, the Gharma's symbol Nagnahu.
Three nights with Surā poured, this is the symbol of the
Upasads. {#19:14}

Emblem of purchased Soma is Parisrut, foaming drink effused:
Indra's balm milked for Indra by the Asvins and Sarasvatī. {#19:15}

The Sacrificer's seat is the throne's symbol, the jar containing
Surā of the Altar.
The mid-space is the northern Altar's symbol: the cloth for
filtering is the physician. {#19:16}

Altar by Altar is produced, power, holy grass by holy grass.
The stake is by the stake obtained, by Agni Agni carried
forth. {#19:17}

The Asvins are the Soma store, Sarasvatī the sacred hearth.
For Indra formed is Indra s seat, the Matrons' Hall, the
house-lord's fire. {#19:18}

[pg 175]

Orders he gains by orders, by Āprīs Āprīs of sacrifice,
Post-offerings by fore-offerings, and by calls of Vashat Āhutis. {#19:19}

By victims he gains victims, by ground rice-cakes sacrificial
food,
By metres kindling-verses, and Vashat-calls by Inviting
prayers. {#19:20}

Grain roasted, gruel, barley-meal, grains of rice roasted, milk
and curd
Are types of Soma: mingled milk, sweet whey, of sacrificial
food. {#19:21}

Type of parched corn is jujube-fruit; wheat of the roasted
grains of rice; Jujube the type of barley-meal, and Indra-grains
of gruel-groats. {#19:22}

Symbol of milk are barley-grains, symbol of curd are
jujube-fruits.
Whey is the type of Soma, and milk-mixture type of
Soma's pap. {#19:23}

The Strophe is the cry, Bid hear? the answer is the antistrophe.
Sacrifice! is the Dhāyyā's form, Pragāthas’ the Yajāmahas. {#19:24}

By verse-halves comes the Ukthas’ type, Nivids by Padas he
obtains.
The type of Sastras is obtained by Pranavas, Soma by milk. {#19:25}

[pg 176]

Gained by the Asvins is the morn's libation, Indra's libation
of mid-day by Indra.
Sarasvatī obtains the third outpouring, the offering sacred
to the Visve Devas. {#19:26}

By Vāyu cups he gains the cups of Vāyu, and by the basket
gains the vat for Soma.
By the two jars he gains two cleansing-vessels, and by the
cooking-pot the pot for cooking. {#19:27}

By sacrificial texts are gained the Grahas, and by the Grahas
lauds and laud-arrangements.
By metres are obtained Ukthas and praise-songs, and by the
Sāma-chant the Avabhritha. {#19:23}

Draughts he obtains by pouring out libations, and wishes
by the utterance of praises,
By Samyu he obtains Patnīsamyājas, and Consummation by
Samishtayajus. {#19:29}

He gains by vow of fasting Consecration, by Consecration
gains the priestly guerdon.
He gains by priestly guerdon faith: by faith comes knowledge
of the truth. {#19:30}

So far the type of sacrifice was formed by Brahma, and the
Gods.
All this he gains, when juice is shed, in the Santrāmanī
sacrifice. {#19:31}

The rite with sacred grass, wine, store of heroes, the mighty
ones speed on with adorations.
May we, sweet-singing sacrificers, setting Soma mid Gods in
heaven, give joy to Indra. {#19:32}

[pg 177]

All essence of thine own in plants collected, all strength of
Soma when poured out with Surā—
Therewith impel with joy the sacrifice, Sarasvatī, the Asvins,
Indra, Agni. {#19:33}

That which Sarasvatī poured out for Indra, by Asvins
brought from Namuchi the demon,
This flowing drop, brilliant and full of sweetness, I drink
and feed on here, the King, the Soma. {#19:34}

Whatever portion of the savoury fluid is clinging here,
what Indra drank with powers,
That drop thereof with pure and holy spirit I drink and
feed upon, the King, the Soma. {#19:35}

To Fathers who claim Svadhā be Svadhā and homage!
To Grandfathers who claim Svadhā be Svadhā and homage!
To Great-grandfathers who claim Svadhā be Svadhā and
homage!
The Fathers have eaten. The Fathers have rejoiced. The
Fathers have been satisfied, Fathers, be ye purified. {#19:36}

Cleanse me the Fathers who enjoy Soma! Grandfathers
make me clean!
May Great-grandfathers cleanse me with a sieve that brings
a century.
May my Grandfathers cleanse me, may my Great-grand-fathers
make me clean.
With sieve that brings a century may I obtain full length
of life. {#19:37}

Agni, thou poorest life: send down upon us food and vigorous
strength.
Drive thou misfortune far away. {#19:33}

[pg 178]

Cleanse me the companies of Gods! May thoughts with
spirit make me clean.
Cleanse me all things that be! Do thou, O Jātavedas, make
me clean. {#19:39}

Purify me, O Agni, God, refulgent with thy pure bright
sieve,
With powers according to thine own. {#19:40}

O Agni, may the cleansing sieve, diffused through all thy
fiery glow,
Holy devotion, make me clean. {#19:41}

May Pavamāna with his sieve, Guest of all tribes, cleanse
us to-day,
He who is Cleanser make us clean. {#19:42}

Savitar, God, by both of these, libation, purifying power,
Purify me on every side. {#19:43}

Dear to all Gods hath come the cleansing Goddess, she who
contains these many smooth-backed figures.
Through her may we in sacrificial banquets taking our pleasure
be the lords of riches. {#19:44}

The Fathers who in Yama's realm are equal and unanimous—
Their world is Svadhā, reverence. To Gods let sacrifice be
paid. {#19:45}

Equals, unanimous, my folk yet living among those who
live—
On me be set their glory through a hundred years in this
our world. {#19:46}

[pg 179]

I have heard mention of two several pathways, way of the
Fathers, way of Gods and mortals.
On these two roads each moving creature travels, each
thing between the Father and the Mother. {#19:47}

May this my sacrifice bring store of children, with ten
brave sons, full-companied, for welfare—
Life-winning, winning offspring, winning cattle, winning this
world of ours and peace and safety.
May Agni make nay progeny abundant. Do ye confer food,
milk, and wanly vigour. {#19:48}

May they ascend, the lowest, highest, midmost, the Fathers
who deserve a share of Soma.
May Fathers who have gained the world of spirits, gentle
and righteous, aid us when we call them. {#19:49}

Our Fathers are Angirases, Navagvas, Atharvans, Bhrigus,
who deserve the Soma.
May these the holy look on us with favour: may we enjoy
their gracious loving-kindness. {#19:50}

Our ancient Fathers who deserve the Soma, who came, most
noble, to our Soma banquet—
With these let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing
eat our offerings at his pleasure. {#19:51}

Thou, Soma, art preeminent for wisdom: along the straightest
path thou art our leader.
Our prudent Fathers by thy wisdom, Soma, dealt out
among the Gods their share of treasure. {#19:52}

For our sage Fathers, Soma Pavamāna, of old performed by
thee their sacred duties.
Fighting unvanquished, open the enclosures: enrich us
with large gifts of steeds and heroes. {#19:53}

[pg 180]

Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself
abroad through earth and heaven.
So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become
the lords of riches. {#19:54}

Fathers who sit on sacred grass, come help us: these offerings
we have made for you; accept them.
So come to us with most auspicious favour, and give us
health and strength without a trouble. {#19:55}

I have attained the gracious-minded Fathers, have gained
a son and progeny from Vishnu.
They who enjoy pressed juices with oblation, seated on
sacred grass, come oftenest hither. {#19:56}

May they, the Fathers, worthy of the Soma, invited to their
favourite oblations
Laid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen: may they
be gracious unto us and bless us. {#19:57}

May they our Fathers whom the flames have tasted, worthy
of Soma, come on God-ward pathways.
Enjoying at this sacrifice their portion, may they be gracious
unto us and bless us. {#19:58}

Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh:
ye kindly leaders, take ye each your proper place.
Eat sacrificial food presented on the grass: grant riches
with a multitude of hero sons. {#19:59}

[pg 181]

For those who, burnt with fire or not cremated, joy in their
portion in the midst of heaven,
May the Self-Ruler form the world of spirits and this their
body as his pleasure wills it. {#19:60}

We call the Agnishvāttas, true to seasons, those who drank
Soma in the Nārāsamsa.
Prompt to give ear to us be they, the sages, and then let
us be lords of wealth and treasure. {#19:61}

Bowing the bended knee and seated southward, accept ye,
all, this sacrifice with favour.
Injure us not for any sin, O Fathers, which we through
human frailty have committed. {#19:62}

Lapped in the bosom of the purple Mornings give riches
to the man who brings oblation.
Grant to his sons a portion of your treasure, and, present,
give us energy, ye Fathers. {#19:63}

O Agni Kavyavāhana, cause us to praise before the Gods,
As our associate meet for lauds, wealth which e’en thou reputest
wealth. {#19:64}

May Agni, Kavya-bearer, who hath worshipped Fathers
true to Law.
Announce to Gods and Fathers these our sacrificial offerings. {#19:65}

Thou. Agni Kavya-bearer, when entreated, didst bear the
offerings which thou madest fragrant,
And gayest to the Fathers who did eat them with Svadhā.
Eat, thou God, the gifts we bring thee. {#19:66}

[pg 182]

Thou, Jātavedas, knowest well the number of Fathers who
are here and who are absent,
Of Fathers whom we know and whom we know not. Accept
the sacrifice arranged with portions. {#19:67}

Now let us pay this homage to the Fathers, to those who
passed of old and those who followed,
Those who have rested in the earthly region and those who
dwell among the Mighty Races. {#19:68}

As in the days of old our ancient Fathers speeding the work
of holy worship, Agni!
Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises, they cleft
the ground and made red Dawns apparent. {#19:69}

Right gladly do we set thee down, right gladly make thee
burn and glow.
Gladly bring yearning Fathers nigh to eat the food of
sacrifice. {#19:70}

Indra, with waters’ foam didst thou wrench off the head of
Namuchi,
Subduing all contending hosts. {#19:71}

King Soma, pressed, the Drink of Life, left Death behind
with Soma-dregs.
By Law came truth and Indra-power, the pure bright drinking-off
of juice. The power of Indra was this sweet immortal
milk. {#19:72}

The Snipe of Angiras by thought from out the waters
drank up milk.
By Law came truth, etc., as in 72. {#19:73}

[pg 183]

The Hamsa throned in light drank up by metre Soma from
the floods.
By Law, etc. {#19:74}

Prajāpati by Brahma drank the essence from the foaming
food, the princely power, milk, Soma juice. By Law, etc. {#19:75}

The generative part enters the *yoni:* it leaves aside the
*retas* and the *mūtra*.
The caul-invested embryo leaves by its birth the covering
folds. By Law, etc. {#19:76}

Viewing both forms Prajāpati gave truth and falsehood
different shapes.
Prajāpati assigned the lack of faith to falsehood, faith to
truth. By Law, etc. {#19:77}

By holy lore Prajāpati drank up both forms, pressed and
unpressed.
By Law, etc. {#19:78}

Seeing the farming liquor's sap, Prajāpati with the bright
drank nut the bright the milk, the Soma juice. By Law,
etc. {#19:79}

Wise, with mind, lead, and thread of wool the sages twine
an amulet.
Sarasvatī, Savitar, Varuna, the Asvins span sacrifice and
healed his form for Indra. {#19:80}

This his immortal shape with mighty powers three Deities
bestowing gifts compounded.
His hair they made with sprouts of grass and barley, and
roasted grain with skin and flesh supplied him. {#19:81}

His inner shape Sarasvatī arranges and, borne on bright
paths, the Physician Asvins:
With Māsaras and sieve his bone and marrow, as on the
Oxen's hide they lay the liquor. {#19:82}

[pg 184]

By thought Sarasvatī with both Nāsatyas forms lovely treasure
and a beauteous body.
Like shuttle through the loom the steady ferment mixes
the red juice with the foaming spirit. {#19:83}

By milk they generated bright immortal, productive seed,
by Surā seed from urine,
Chasing afar folly and ill intention, crude food and wind
and meat that loads the stomach. {#19:84}

Heart with his heart Indra Good Guardian gendered: with
rice-cake Savitar gave truth its being.
Varuna, doctoring the lungs and liver, forms, as with Vāyu
cups, the gall and kidneys. {#19:85}

Cooking-pots pouring honey were the entrails: like a
well-milking cow the pans were bowels.
A hawk's wing was the spleen: through mighty powers the
stool as mother was navel and belly. {#19:86}

The pitcher was the father of the rectum by powers, the
womb which first contained the infant.
Plain was the hundred-streaming fount as penis: the jar
poured forth libations to the Father. {#19:87}

His face the basket, thence his head; the strainer his
tongue, his mouth Sarasvatī and Asvins.
The Chapya was his rump, his leech the filter, the bladder
was his penis keen with ardour. {#19:88}

Asvins with both cups made his eye immortal, the goat and
cooked oblation gave it keenness.
With wheat eyelashes and with jujube eyebrows they clothe
as ’twere a black and brilliant figure. {#19:89}

The sheep, the ram to give his nostril vigour. the immortal
path of breath by both libations.
By Indra-grains and sacrificial jujubes Sarasvatī produced
through-breath and nose hairs. {#19:90}

[pg 185]

The hull for strength made Indra's form: the immortal
bearing for both his ears by two libations.
Barley and sacred grass composed his eyebrows: from his
mouth came the jujube and sweet honey. {#19:91}

Hair of the wolf was on his waist and body: the beard upon
his face was hair of tigers.
Lions hair were his locks, for fame and beauty, worn on
his head, his crest and sheen and vigour. {#19:92}

The Asvins, Leeches, joined his limbs and body, Sarasvatī
put limbs and frame together,
Giving the form and vital power of Indra, hundredfold,
deathless and delightful lustre. {#19:93}

Sarasvatī, as Consort of the Asvins, bears in her womb the
nobly fashioned Infant.
King Varuna with waters’ wealthy essence begetting Indra
in the floods for glory. {#19:94}

Splendour of victims, powerful oblation, honey and meath
with milk and foaming liquor,
Healing Sarasvatī effused, and Asvins; from pressed and
unpressed Soma, deathless Indu. {#19:95}

My hair is effort and attempt, my skin is reverence and
approach.
My flesh is inclination, wealth my bone, my marrow reverence. {#20:13}

Gods, Deities, whatever fault of ours have stirred the wrath
of Gods,
May Agni set me free from that iniquity and all distress. {#20:14}

If in the day-time or at night we have committed acts of sin,
May Vāyu set me free from that iniquity and all distress. {#20:15}

[pg 188]

If when awake or in our sleep we have committed acts of
sin,
May Sūrya set me free from that iniquity and all distress. {#20:16}

Each fault in village or in wild, company or corporeal sense,
Each sinful act that we have done to Sūdra or Arya, or to
either's disadvantage, e’en of that sin thou art the expiation. {#20:17}

Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have
come
To Sūrya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent. {#20:21}

To the fast-vow and faith I come. I, consecrated, kindle

Fain would I know that holy world where Deities with

in his auspicious favour.
May helpful Indra as our Good Preserver drive from us even
from afar, our foemen. {#20:52}

Come hither, Indra, with Bay Steeds, joyous, with tails like
peacock plumes,
Let no men check thy course as fowlers stay the bird: pass
o’er them as o’er desert lands. {#20:53}

One whose arm wields thunder.
Praised, may he guard our wealth in men and cattle. Ye
Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings. {#20:54}

form, wealth that shall bring us room and rest. {#20:83}

desire with eager love our sacrifice.
S5 She who awakens sounds of joy, inspires our hymns, Sarasvatī,
she hath allowed our sacrifice. {#20:84}

thee, thus by fine fingers purified. {#20:87}

Urged by the holy singer, sped by song, come, Indra, to the
prayers of the libation-pouring priest. {#20:88}

prayer: in our libations take delight. {#20:89}

## BOOK THE TWENTY-THIRD. {#23}

IN the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc:

Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee welcome to Prajāpati.
This is thy place: Sūrya thy majesty.
The majesty that has accrued to thee in the day, in a year,
that majesty which has accrued in the wind, in the firmament,
to that majesty of thine, to Prajāpati, to the Gods,
All-hail! {#23:2}

Who, by his, grandeur hath become sole Ruler of all the.
moving world that breathes and slumbers;
He who is Sovran of these men and cattle—what God shall
we adore with our oblation? {#23:3}

Taken upon a base art thou. I take thee welcome to Prajāpati,
This is thy place: the Moon thy majesty.
Thy majesty that has accrued to thee by night, in a year,
thy majesty that has accrued in the earth, in Agni, in the
stars and in the Moon, to that majesty of thine, to Prajāpati
and to the Gods, All-hail! {#23:4}

They who stand round hills as he moves harness the bright,
the ruddy Steed:
The lights are shining in the sky. {#23:5}

On both sides to the car they yoke the two. Bay Coursers
dear to him,
Bold; tawny, bearers of the Chief. {#23:6}

When, swift as wind, the Horse has reached the form that
Indra loves, the flood,
Again, O singer, by this path bring thou our Courser hitherward. {#23:7}

[pg 211]

Let the Vasus anoint thee with Gāyatrī metre. Let the
Rudras anoint thee with Trishtup metre. Let the Ādityas
anoint thee with Jagatī metre. Earth! Ether! Heaven!
O Gods, eat this food, parched grains and groats in the
product of barley and in the product of cows: eat this
food, Prajāpati. {#23:8}

Who moveth single and alone? Who is brought forth to life
again?
What is the remedy of cold, or what the great receptacle? {#23:9}

The Sun moves single and alone. The Moon is brought to
life again,
Fire is the remedy of cold; Earth is the great receptacle. {#23:10}

What was the antecedent thought? What was the bird of
mighty size?
The slippery matron, who was she? Who was the
reddish-coloured one? {#23:11}

Heaven was the antecedent thought. The Courser was the
mighty bird.
The slippery matron was the earth, Night was the
reddish-coloured one. {#23:12}

Vāyu help thee with cooked viands! Blackneck with goats;
Nyagrodha with cups; Salmali with increase; this Stallion
here, good for the chariot—let him verily come with
his four feet. Brahmākrishna help us! Obeisance to Agni! {#23:13}

[pg 212]

The car is fitted with the rein, the steed is fitted with the rein.
Fitted in waters, water-born, is Brahmā following Soma's lead. {#23:14}

Steed, from thy body, of thyself, sacrifice and accept thyself.
Thy greatness can be gained by none but thee. {#23:15}

No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by
fair paths to the Gods thou guest,
May Savitar the God in that world place thee where dwell
the pious, whether they have journeyed. {#23:16}

Agni was the victim. With him they sacrificed. He won this
world in which Agni is. This shall become thy world.
This shalt thou win. Drink these waters. Vāyu was the
victim. With him they sacrificed. He won this world
in which Vāyu is. This shall become, etc., as above.
Sūrya was the victim, etc, He won the world in which
Sūrya is. This shall become, etc. {#23:17}

To vital breath, Hail! To out-breathing, Hail! To diffusive
breath, Hail!
Ambā! Ambikā! Ambālikā! No one is taking me away.
The sorry horse will lie beside another, as Subhadrā, the
dweller in Kāmpila. {#23:18}

[pg 213]

Thee we invoke, troop-lord of troops, Thee we invoke, the
loved ones’ lord.
Thee, lord of treasures, we invoke. My precious wealth!
.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .
.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . {#23:19}

Now have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikrāvan,
conquering steed,
Sweet may he make our mouths: may he prolong the days
we have to live. {#23:32}

Gāyatrī, Trishtup, Jagatī, and Pankti with Anushtup joined,
Brihatī, Kakup, Ushnihā pacify thee with needle-points! {#23:33}

Two-footed, those that have four feet, those with three feet
and those with five,
Metteless, with one metre; these pacify thee with needle-points! {#23:34}

May Mahānāmnīs, Revatīs, all far-spread Regions of the sky,
Voices, and lightnings from the cloud pacify thee with needle-points! {#23:35}

May married dames of human birth skilfully separate thy hair:
The Regions, Consorts of the Gods, pacify thee with needle-points! {#23:36}

[pg 214]

They, made of silver, gold, and lead, are used as helpers in
the work.
As lines on the strong Courser's skin may they console and
give thee rest. {#23:37}

What then? As men whose fields are full of barley, etc., as
in X. 32. {#23:38}

Who flays thee? Who dissects thee? Who prepares thy limbs
for sacrifice?
Who is the Sage that slaughters thee? {#23:39}

In due time let the seasons as thy Slaughterers divide thy
joints,
And with the splendour of the Year sacrifice thee with holy
rites. {#23:40}

Let the Half-months and let the Months, while sacrificing,
flay thy limbs:
Let Day and Night and Maruts mend each fault in sacrificing
thee. {#23:41}

Let the divine Adhvaryus flay thy body and dissect thy
frame,
And let the sacrificing lines prepare thy members joint by
joint, {#23:42}

May Sky, Earth, Air, and Wind supply each failing and
defect of thine:
May Sūrya with the Stars of heaven duly prepare a world
for thee. {#23:43}

Well be it with thine upper parts, well be it with the parts
below!
Well he it with thy bones and with thy marrow and with all
thy frame! {#23:44}

Who moveth singly? etc., as in verse 9. {#23:45}

The Sun moves singly, etc., as in verse 10. {#23:46}

What lustre is like Sūrya's light? What lake is equal to the
Sea?[pg 215]
What is more spacious than the Earth? What thing is that
which naught can mete? {#23:47}

Brahma is lustre like the Sea. Heaven is a flood to match
the Sea.
Indra is vaster than the Earth. Beyond all measure is the
Cow. {#23:48}

Friend of the Gods, I ask, for information, if thou in spirit
hast obtained the knowledge,
Hath Vishnu this whole Universe pervaded in the three steps
wherein the God is worshipped? {#23:49}

I also am in those three steps of Vishnu wherewith this Universe
he permeated.
The earth and heaven I circle in a moment and this heaven's
summit with a single organ. {#23:50}

What are the things which Purusha hath entered? What
things hath Purusha contained within him?
This riddle we propound to thee, O Brahman. Why dost
thou give no answer to my question? {#23:51}

Within five things hath Purusha found entrance; these
Purusha hath within himself connected.
This is the thought which I return in answer. Thou art
not my superior in wisdom. {#23:52}

What was the antecedent thought? etc., as in verse 11. {#23:53}

Heaven was the antecedent thought, etc., as in 12. {#23:54}

Who, tell me, is the yellowish she? Who is the darkly-
yellowish?
Who moves with rapid spring and bound? Who glides and
winds along the path? {#23:55}

[pg 216]

The she-goat, Sir, is yellowish, dark-yellowish is the porcupine.
The hare moves swift with leap and bound: the snake creeps
winding on the path. {#23:56}

How many different forms hath this, how many syllables,
burnt-oblations, brands for kindling?
Here, of the rites of sacrifice I ask thee. How many Hotars
in due season worship? {#23:57}

Sixfold its form, its syllables a hundred, eighty burnt-offerings,
just three brands for kindling.
To thee I tell the rites of sacrificing. Seven Hotars worship
in appointed season. {#23:68}

Who knoweth this world's central point? Who knoweth the
heaven, the earth, and the wide air between them?
Who knows the birthplace of the mighty Sūrya? Who knows
the Moon, whence he was generated? {#23:59}

I know the centre of the world about us. I know heaven,
earth, and the wide air between them.
I know the birthplace of the mighty Sūrya. I know the
Moon, whence he was generated. {#23:60}

I ask thee of the earth's extremest limit, where is the
centre of the world, I ask thee.
I ask thee of the Stallion's genial humour, I ask of highest
heaven where Speech abideth. {#23:61}

This altar is the earth's extremest limit; this sacrifice of
ours is the world's centre.
This Soma is the Stallion's genial humour, this Brahman
highest heaven where Speech abideth. {#23:62}

[pg 217]

The Strong, the Self-existent One, the First, within the
mighty flood
Laid down the timely embryo from which Prajāpati was born. {#23:63}

Let the Hotar sacrifice to Prajāpati from the Mahiman-Soma.
Let him accept. Let him drink the Soma. Hotar, sacrifice. {#23:64}

Prajāpati, thou only, etc., as in X. 20. {#23:65}

ducts; hocks with his spleen; Ant-hills with his lungs;
Shrubs with his heart-vessels; Streams with his veins;
Lakes with his flanks; Sea with his belly; Vaisvānara
with his ashes. {#25:8}

[pg 226]

I gratify Separation with his navel; Butter with his flavour;
the Waters with his broth; Sunbeams with his drops of
fat; Hoar-frost with his heat; Ice with his marrow; Hailstones
with his tears; Thunderbolts with the rheum of
his eyes; Rākshasas with his blood; Bright things with
his limbs; Stars with his beauty; Earth with his skin.
All-hail to Jumbaka! {#25:9}

In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc., as in XIII. 4;
XXIII. 1. {#25:10}

Who by his grandeur, etc., as in XXIII. 3. {#25:11}

Whose, by his might, are these snow-covered mountains,
and men call sea and Rasā his possession:
Whose are these arms, whose are these heavenly regions.
What God shall we adore with our oblation? {#25:12}

Giver of vital breath, of power and vigour, he whose
commandment all the Gods acknowledge:
The Lord of death, whose shade is life immortal. What
God shall we adore with our oblation? {#25:13}

May powers auspicious come to us from every side, never
deceived, unhindered and victorious,
That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians
day by day, unceasing in their care. {#25:14}

May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us
descend the bounty of the righteous Gods.
The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so
may the Gods extend our life that we may live. {#25:15}

[pg 227]

We call them hither with a hymn of olden time, Bhaga, the
friendly Daksha, Mitra, Aditi,
Aryaman, Varuna, Soma, the Asvins. May Sarasvatī, auspicious,
grant felicity. {#25:16}

May the Wind waft to us that pleasant medicine, may Earth
our Mother give it, and our Father Heaven,
And the joy-giving stones that press the Soma's juice. Asvins,
may ye, for whom our spirits long, hear this. {#25:17}

Him we invoke for aid who reigns supreme, the Lord of all
that stands or moves, inspirer of the soul,
That Pūshan may promote the increase of our wealth, our
keeper and our guard infallible for our good. {#25:18}

Illustrious far and wide, may Indra prosper us: may Pūshan
prosper us, the Master of all wealth.
May Tārkshya with uninjured fellies prosper us: Brihaspati
vouchsafe to us prosperity. {#25:19}

The Maruts, Sons of Prisni, borne by spotted steeds, moving
in glory, oft visiting holy rites,
Sages whose tongue is Agni and their eyes the Sun,——hither
let all the Gods for our protection come. {#25:20}

Gods, may we with our ears listen to what is good, and with
our eyes see what is good, ye Holy Ones.
With limbs and bodies firm may we extolling you attain the
term of life appointed by the Gods. {#25:21}

A hundred autumns stand before us, O ye Gods, within
whose space ye bring our bodies to decay;
Within whose space our sons become fathers in turn. Break
ye not in the midst our course of fleeting life. {#25:22}

Aditi is the heaven, Aditi is mid-air, Aditi is the Mother
and the Sire and Son.[pg 228]
Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath
been born and shall be born. {#25:23}

Slight us not Varuna, Aryaman, or Mitra, Ribhukshan,
Indra, Āyu, or the Maruts,
When we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the
Strong Steed, God-descended. {#25:24}

What time they bear before the Courser, covered with
trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation,
The dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the
place dear to Indra and to Pūshan. {#25:25}

Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pūshan, is first led
forward with the vigorous Courser,
While Tvashtar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable
for sacrifice, to glory. {#25:26}

When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who
goeth to the Gods as meet oblation,
The goat precedeth him, the share of Pūshan, and to the
Gods the sacrifice announceth. {#25:27}

Invoker, ministering priest, stoner, fire-kindler, Soma-presser,
sage, reciter,
With this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full
the channels of the rivers. {#25:28}

The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those
who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake;
Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,—may
the approving help of these promote our work. {#25:29}

Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his
smooth back is come; my prayer attends him.
In him rejoice the singer and the sages. A good friend
have we won for the Gods’ banquet. {#25:30}

[pg 229]

May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the headstall
and the girths and cords about him,
And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,—among
the Gods, too, let all these be with thee. {#25:31}

What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left
sticking to the post or hatchet,
Or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,—among the
Gods, tog, may all this he with thee. {#25:32}

Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of
raw flesh remaining,
This let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice
with perfect cooking. {#25:33}

What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou
art set upon the spit, distilleth,—
Let not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing
Gods let all be offered. {#25:34}

They who, observing that the Horse is ready, call out and
say, The smell is good; remove it;
And, craving meat, await the distribution,—may their
approving help promote our labour. {#25:35}

The trial-fork of the flesh cooking caldron, the vessels out
of which the broth is sprinkled,
The warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks,
carving-boards,—all these attend the Charger. {#25:36}

Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor
glowing caldron smell and break to pieces.
Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,—such Charger
do the Gods accept with favour. {#25:37}

The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes
wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened,
The water that he drank, the food he tasted,—among the
Gods, too, may all these attend thee. {#25:38}

The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the
upper covering and the golden trappings,
The halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,—all
these, as grateful to the Gods, they offer. {#25:39}

If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his
heel or with his whip distressed thee,
All these thy woes, as with oblation's ladle at sacrifices,
with my prayer I banish. {#25:40}

The four-and-thirty ribs of the swift Courser, kin to the
Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces.[pg 230]
Cut ye with skill so that the parts be flawless, and piece by
piece declaring them dissect them. {#25:41}

Of Tvashtar's Courser there is one dissector: this is the
custom: two there are who guide him.
Such of his limbs as I divide in order, all these, amid the
lumps, in fire I offer. {#25:42}

Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the
hatchet linger in thy body.
Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints,
mangle thy limbs unduly. {#25:43}

No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: only by easy
paths to Gods thou goest.
Both Bays, both Spotted Mares are now thy fellows, and to
the Ass's pole is yoked the Courser. {#25:44}

May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in
good kine, good horses, manly offspring.
Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us; the Steed with
our oblations gain us lordship! {#25:45}

We will, with Indra and all Gods to help us, bring these
existing worlds into subjection.
With the Ādityas, with the band of Maruts, may Indra
give us medicine to heal us.
Our sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspring may Indra
regulate with the Ādityas. {#25:46}

O Agni, be our nearest Friend, etc., as in III. 25.
To thee then, O Most Bright, etc., as in III. 26. {#25:47}

Dear may I be to Gods and guerdon-giver. Fulfilled be this

Give us, Brihaspati, that wondrous treasure, that which

The heat that wasteth not, we seek.
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for Vaisvānara.
This is thy home: thee for Vaisvānara. {#26:6}

Still in Vaisvānara's grace may we continue: yea, he is
King Supreme o’er all things living.
Sprung hence to life upon this All he looketh. Vaisvānara
hath rivalry with Sūrya.
Taken upon a base art thou, etc., as in verse 6. {#26:7}

Hitherward come Vaisvānara to succour us from far away,
Agni through laud that brings him near!
Taken upon a base, etc, as in verse 6. {#26:8}

Agni is Pavamāna, Sage, the Tribe-Priest of the Races Five:
To him of mighty wealth we pray.
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for lustre. This is thy
home. Thee for lustre. {#26:9}

May mighty Indra, thunder-armed, may Shodasī protect us
well, and slay the wicked man who hateth us.
Taken upon a base art thou. Thee for Mahendra. This is
thy home. Thee for Mahendra. {#26:10}

As cows low to their calves in stalls so with our songs we
glorify
This Indra, e’en your wondrous God who checks assault,
who joys in the delicious juice. {#26:11}

Agni's is the most fetching song. Shine mightily, thou rich
in light!
Like the Chief Consort of a King, riches and strength proceed
from thee. {#26:12}

[pg 233]

Come, here, O Agni, will I sing verily other songs to thee,
And with these drops shalt thou grow strong. {#26:13}

The Seasons spread thy sacrifice! the Mouths protect thine
offering!
May the Year guard our sacrifice for thee and keep our children
safe. {#26:14}

There where the mountains downward slope, there by the
meeting of the streams
The sage was manifest with song. {#26:15}

High is thy juice's birth: though sat in heaven, on earth it
hath obtained
Strong sheltering power and great renown. {#26:16}

Finder of room and freedom, flow for Indra, meet for worship,

For Varuna and the Marut host. {#26:17}

Striving to win, with him we gain all wealth of the ungodly
one,
Yea, all the glories of mankind. {#26:18}

May we be prosperous with brave sons, cattle, horses, each
wish of ours, and varied blessings,
With quadrupeds, and with the men about us. May the
Gods guide our sacrifice in season. {#26:19}

O Agni, bring thou hitherward the yearning Consorts of the
Gods
Bring Tvashtar to the Soma-draught. {#26:20}

O Neshtar girt by Dames, accept our sacrifice: with Ritu
drink,
For thou art he who giveth wealth. {#26:21}

He with the Ritus fain would drink, Wealth-river, from the
Neshtar's bowl.
Begin, pay offerings: hasten ye. {#26:22}

Sit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these
drops into thy belly, Indra. {#26:28}

Come unto us, ye swift to listen! as at home, upon the
sacred grass sit and enjoy yourselves.
And, Tvashtar, well content be joyful in the juice with Gods
and Goddesses in gladsome company. {#26:24}

In sweetest and most gladdening stream flow pure, O Soma,

## BOOK THE TWENTY-SEVENTH {#27}

HALF-YEARS and Seasons strengthen thee, O Agni, the Years
and all the Verities and Rishis!
Flash forth with thy celestial effulgence: illumine all four
regions of the heaven.

Kindle thee, Agni, rake this man to knowledge: rise up
erect for great and happy fortune.
Agni, be those uninjured who adore thee, thy priests be
glorious and none beside them! {#27:2}

The Brahmans present here elect thee, Agni: be thou
propitious in our sanctuary.
Slayer of rivals, Agni, quell our foemen: watch in thy house
with care that never ceases. {#27:3}

Even here do thou, O Agni, stablish wealth: let not oppressors
injure thee by thinking of thee first.
Light be thy task of ruling, Agni, with thy power: may he
who worships thee wax strong, invincible. {#27:4}

Kind to the people, grasp thy power, O Agni: contend thou
with the Friend by way of friendship.
Placed, Agni, in the centre of our kinsmen, flash forth to be
invoked by Kings around thee. {#27:5}

Past those who slay, past enemies, past thoughtless men,
past those who hate,—
Yes, Agni, drive away all woe and trouble: vouchsafe us
opulence with men about us. {#27:6}

Holder of sway, shine here refulgent, Agni! invincible,
unconquered Jātavedas.
Light all the regions, chasing human terrors: with happy
helps guard us to-day for increase. {#27:7}

[pg 236]

Brihaspati, Savitar, give this man knowledge: sharpen him
thoroughly though already sharpened.
To great and high felicity exalt him: in him let all the Gods
rejoice and triumph. {#27:8}

As thou, Brihaspati, from curse hast freed us, from dwelling
yonder in the realm of Yama,
The Asvins, Leeches of the Gods, O Agni, have chased Death
far from us with mighty powers. {#27:9}

Looking upon the loftier light, etc., as in XX. 21. {#27:10}

Uplifted are the brands that are his fuel: lofty and brilliant
are the flames of Agni,
Splendidly bright of the Son fair of aspect. {#27:11}

Tanūnapāt the Asura, all-possessing, God among Gods, the
God with mead and butter shall bedew the paths. {#27:13}

With mead to sacrifice thou comest, Agni, earnest as friendly-
minded Narāsamsa, and Savitar righteous God who brings
all blessings. {#27:13}

He cometh hitherward with power and fatness, the luminous,
implored with adoration.
While rites proceed the ladles move to Agni. {#27:14}

Let him pay worship to this Agni's greatness, daintily fed:
he verily gives enjoyments:
The wisest Vasu he, and best wealth giver. {#27:15}

Widely expansive, ruling by foundation, the Doors divine—
and, after, all—
Preserve this Agni's holy works. {#27:16}

May Dawn and Night protect—his heavenly Consorts—in
a his home this our sacrificial worship. {#27:17}

Ye two celestial Hotars, greet with praises this lofty rite of
ours, the tongue of Agni.
Cause that our sacrifice be well conducted. {#27:18}

[pg 237]

Upon this grass three Goddesses be seated, Idā, Sarasvatī,
Bhāratī the Mighty glorified with song. {#27:19}

This our productive wondrous flow may Tvashtar pour down
on this man's kin, and wealth and heroes. {#27:20}

Vanaspatī, presenting of thyself, send God-ward! Let Agni,
Immolator, season our oblation. {#27:21}

Pay sacrifice to Indra, Jātavedas Agni! with Hail! All Gods
accept the gift we offer! {#27:22}

Wise, bright, arranger of his teams, he seeketh men with
rich food whose treasures are abundant.
They have stood firm of one accord with Vāyu: yea, the
men wrought all noble operations. {#27:23}

The God whom both these worlds brought forth for riches,
whom heavenly Dhishanā for our wealth appointeth—
His team of harnessed horses waits on Vāyu and, foremost,
on the radiant treasure-holder. {#27:24}

What time the mighty waters came containing the universal
germ, producing Agni,
Thence sprang the Gods’ one spirit into being. What God
shall we adore with our oblation? {#27:26}

Who in his might surveyed the floods enclosing productive
force and generating Worship,
He who is God mid Gods, and none beside him—What God
shall we adore with our oblation? {#27:26}

The teams wherewith thou seekest him who offers, within
his house, O Vāyu, to direct him,
Therewith send wealth to us with full enjoyment, a hero son
and gifts of kine and horses. {#27:27}

With thy yoked teams in hundreds and in thousands come
to our sacrifice and solemn worship.
O Vāyu, make thee glad at this libation. Preserve us evermore,
ye Gods, with blessings. {#27:28}

[pg 238]

Drawn by thy team, O Vāyu, come: to thee is offered this,
the pure.
Thou visitest the presser's house. {#27:29}

Vāyu, the bright is offered thee, best of the meath at holy
rites.
Come thou to drink the Soma juice, God longed-for, on thy
team-drawn car. {#27:30}

Lover of worship, leader, come Vāyu with thought, to sacrifice,
Propitious with propitious teams! {#27:31}

With all the thousand chariots that are thine, O Vāyu, come
to us,
Team-drawn, to drink the Soma juice. {#27:32}

Come thou with one, and ten, O Self-Existent! with two
unto the sacrifice, and twenty.
Three are the teams and thirty which convey thee. O Vāyu,
in this place unyoke thy coursers. {#27:33}

Wonderful Vāyu, Lord of Truth, thou who art Tvashtar's
Son in-law,
Thy saving succour we elect. {#27:34}

Like kine unmilked we call aloud, Hero, to thee and sing
thy praise,
Looker on heavenly light, Lord of this moving world, Lord,
Indra! of what moveth not. {#27:35}

None other like to thee, of earth or of the heavens, hath
been or ever will be born.
Desiring horses, Indra, Bounteous Lord! and kine, as men
of might we call on thee. {#27:36}

That we may win us wealth and power, we poets call on
only thee.
In war men call on thee, Indra! the hero's Lord, in the
steed's race-course call on thee. {#27:37}

As such, O Wonderful, whose hand holds thunder, praised
as mighty, Caster of the Stone![pg 239]
Pour on us boldly, Indra, kine and chariot-steeds ever to be
the conqueror's strength. {#27:38}

What succour will he bring to us, wonderful, ever-prospering
Friend?
With what most mighty company? {#27:39}

What, genuine and most liberal draught will spirit thee with
juice to burst
Open e’en strongly-guarded wealth {#27:40}

Do thou who art protector of us thy friends who praise thee
With hundred aids approach us. {#27:41}

Sing to your Agni with each song, at every sacrifice, for
strength.
Come, let us praise the Wise and Everlasting God even as a
well-belovèd Friend. {#27:42}

Protect us, Agni, through the first, protect us through the
second hymn.
Protect us through three hymns, O Lord of Power and Might;
through four hymns, Vasu! guard thou us. {#27:43}

The Son of Strength; for is he not our Friend? Let us serve
him for offering our gifts.
In battles may he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the
saviour of our lives. {#27:44}

Thou art Samvatsara; thou art Parivatsara; thou art
Idāvatsara; thou art Idvatsara; thou art Vatsara.
Prosper thy Dawns! Prosper thy Day-and-Nights! Prosper
thy Half-months, Months, Seasons, and Years!
Combine them for their going and their coming, and send
then forward on their ordered courses.
In eagle's shape thou art piled up and layered. With that
divinity, Angiras-like, lie steady. {#27:45}

## BOOK THE TWENTY-NINTH. {#29}

DECKING the treasure-house of prayers, O Agni, enkindled,
pouring forth sweet-tasted butter,
Swift-moving, bearing curd, O Jātavedas, bear what they
love to the Gods’ habitation.

Balming the paths that lead to heaven with fatness, let the
Steed go unto the Gods well-knowing.
Courser, the Quarters of the sky attend thee! Bestow thou
food upon this Sacrificer. {#29:2}

Thou, Steed, art meet for laud and veneration; swift, fit for
sacrifice art thou, O Courser.
In concert with the Gods and Vasus Agni Omniscient waft
thee a contented bearer! {#29:3}

Pleased with much Sacred Grass which we have scattered
wide spread upon the earth, a pleasant carpet,
Joined with the Gods may Aditi, accordant, bestowing bliss
award it happy fortune. {#29:4}

May these your Doors divine that wear all colours, auspicious,
with uplifted leaves unfolding,
Lofty and closely fitted and sonorous, rich in adornment,
offer easy passage. {#29:5}

Your two Dawns rich in gold and varied colour, travelling
on ’twixt Varuna and Mitra,
Acquainted with the face of sacrifices, I settle here within
the home of Order. {#29:6}

Your two chief Hotars have I pleased, bright-coloured, borne
on one car, Gods who behold all creatures,
Those who prepare your rules and ordinances and make you
see the light by their direction. {#29:7}

Bhāratī with Ādityas love our worship! Sarasvatī with
Rudras be our helper,
And Idā in accord, invoked with Vasus! Goddesses, place
our rite among the Immortals. {#29:8}

[pg 248]

The God-devoted son Tvashtar produces: from Tvashtar
springs to life your fleet-foot Courser.
Tvashtar gave being to this All about us. Priest, worship
here the mighty work's achiever. {#29:9}

Let the Steed seek his home, and balmed with butter go of
himself unto the Gods in season.
To the Gods’ world Vanaspatī, well-knowing, bear our oblations
which the fire has tasted! {#29:10}

Thou, waxing by Prajāpati's strong fervour, born quickly,
guardest sacrifice, O Agni.
With consecrated offering go, preceding, and let the Sādhyas,
Gods, eat our oblation. {#29:11}

What time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding
from the sea or cloudy vapour,
Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed,
thy birth is high and must be lauded. {#29:12}

This Steed, bestowed by Yama, Trita harnessed, and Indra
was the first to mount and ride him.
His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the
Sun ye fashioned forth the Courser. {#29:13}

Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art Āditya; Trita art thou
by secret operation.
From Soma thou art thoroughly divided. They say there
are three bonds in heaven that hold thee. {#29:14}

Three bonds, they say, thou hast in heaven to bind thee,
three in the waters, three within the ocean.[pg 249]
To me thou seemest Varuna, O Courser, there where they
say is thy sublimest birthplace. {#29:15}

Here, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee;
here are the traces of thy hooves as winner.
Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which
those who guard the holy Law keep safely. {#29:16}

Thyself from far I recognized in spirit, a Bird that from
below flew through the heaven.
I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled
by dust, pleasant to travel. {#29:17}

Here I beheld thy form matchless in beauty, eager to win
thee food at the Cow's station.
Whene’er a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou
swallowest the herbs, most greedy eater. {#29:18}

After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine
come after, and the charm of maidens.
Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern
of thy vigour Gods have followed. {#29:19}

His horns are golden and his feet are iron. Less fleet than
he, though swift as thought, was Indra.
The Gods came only to the oblation-banquet of him who
mounted first of all the Courser. {#29:20}

Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like
heroes, the celestial Coursers
Put forth their strength like swans in lengthened order when
they, the Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway. {#29:21}

A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the
wind in motion is thy spirit.
Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions; they move
with restless beat in wildernesses. {#29:22}

[pg 250]

The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering
with a mind directed God-ward.
The goat who is his kin is led before him: the sages and the
singers follow after. {#29:23}

The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto
his Father and his Mother.
This day shall he approach the Gods, most welcome: then
he declares good gifts to him who worships. {#29:21}

Thou in the house of man this day enkindled worshippest
Gods, a God, O Jātavedas.
Wealthy in friends! observant, bring them hither. Thou
art a sapient envoy, full of wisdom. {#29:25}

Tanūnapāt, fair-tongued, with sweet mead balming the
paths and ways of Order, make them pleasant.
Convey our sacrifice to heaven, exalting with holy thoughts
our hymns of praise and worship. {#29:26}

With sacrifice to these we with laudations will honour holy
Narāsamsa's greatness—
To these the pure, most wise, the thought-inspirers, Gods
who enjoy both sorts of our oblations. {#29:27}

Invoked, deserving laud and adoration, O Agni, come accordant
with the Vasus.
Thou art, O vigorous One, the Gods’ Invoker, so, best of
Sacrificers, bring them quickly. {#29:28}

By rule the Sacred Grass is scattered eastward, a robe to
clothe the earth when dawns are breaking.
Widely it spreads around and far extended, fair for the Gods
and bringing peace and freedom. {#29:29}

Let the expansive Doors be widely opened, like wives who
deck their beauty for their husbands.
Lofty, celestial, all-impelling Portals, admit the Gods and
give them easy access. {#29:30}

[pg 251]

Pouring sweet dews, let holy Night and Morning, each
close to each, be seated at their station—
Lofty, celestial Dames, with gold to deck them, assuming
all their fair and radiant beauty. {#29:31}

Come the two chief celestial sweet-voiced Hotars, arranging
sacrifice for man to worship,
As singers who inspire us in assemblies, showing the eastward
light with their direction! {#29:32}

Let Bhāratī come quickly to our worship, and Idā showing
like a human being.
So let Sarasvatī and both her fellows, deft Goddesses, on
this fair grass be seated. {#29:33}

Hotar more skilled in sacrifice, bring hither with speed today
God Tvashtar, thou who knowest,
Even him who framed these two, the Earth and Heaven,
the Parents, with their forms, and every creature. {#29:34}

Send to our offerings which thyself thou balmest the
Companies of Gods in ordered season.
Agni, Vanaspatī, the Immolator sweeten our offered gift
with mead and butter. {#29:35}

Agni as soon as he was born made ready the sacrifice and
was the Gods’ preceder.
May the Gods eat our offering consecrated according to the
true Priest's voice and guidance. {#29:36}

Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men!
where form was not,
Wast born together with the Dawns. {#29:37}

The warrior's look is like a thunderous rain-cloud's when,
armed with mail, he seeks the lap of battle.
Be thou victorious with unwounded body: so let the thickness
of thine armour save thee. {#29:38}

With Bow let us win kine, with Bow the battle, with Bow
be victors in our hot encounters.
The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with
the Bow may we subdue all regions. {#29:39}

[pg 252]

Close to his ear, as fain to speak, She presses, holding her
well-loved Friend in her embraces.
Strained on the Bow, She whispers like a woman—this
Bow-string that preserves us in the combat. {#29:40}

These, meeting like a woman and her lover, bear,
mother-like, their child upon their bosom.
May the two Bow-ends, starting swift asunder scatter, in
unison, the foes who hate us. {#29:41}

With many a son, father of many daughters, He clangs and
clashes as he goes to battle.
Slung on the back, pouring his brood, the Quiver vanquishes
all opposing bauds and armies. {#29:42}

Upstanding in the Car the skilful Charioteer guides his
strong Horses on whitherso’er he will.
See and admire the strength of those controlling Reins which
from behind declare the will of him who drives {#29:43}

Horses whose hoofs rain dust are neighing loudly, yoked to
the Chariots, showing forth their vigour.
With their forefeet descending on the foemen, they, never
flinching, trample and destroy them. {#29:44}

Car-bearer is the name of his oblation, whereon are laid his
Weapons and his Armour.
So let us here, each day that passes, honour the helpful Car
with hearts exceeding joyful. {#29:45}

In sweet association lived the fathers who gave us life,
profound and strong in trouble,
Unwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, free,
real heroes, conquerors of armies. {#29:46}

[pg 253]

The Brāhmans, and the Fathers meet for Soma draughts,
and, graciously inclined, unequalled Heaven and Earth.
Guard us from evil, Pūshan! guard us strengtheners of
Law! let not the evil-wisher master us. {#29:47}

Her tooth a deer, dressed in an eagle's feathers, bound with
cow-hide, launched forth, She flieth onward.
There where the heroes speed hither and thither, there may
the arrows shelter and protect us. {#29:48}

Avoid as thou whose flight is straight, and let our bodies
be as stone.
May Soma kindly speak to us, and Aditi protect us well. {#29:49}

He lays his blows upon their backs, He deals his strokes
upon their thighs.
Thou Whip who urgest horses, drive sagacious chargers in
the fray. {#29:59}

It compasses the arm with serpent windings, fending away
the friction of the bowstring:
So may the Brace, well skilled in all its duties, guard manfully
the man from every quarter. {#29:51}

Lord of the Wood, be firm and strong in body: be, bearing
us, a brave victorious hero.
Show forth thy strength, compact with straps of leather,
and let thy rider win all spoils of battle. {#29:52}

Its mighty strength was borrowed from the heaven and earth
its conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood.
Honour with holy gifts the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car
bound round with straps, the vigour of the floods. {#29:53}

Thou bolt of Indra, Vanguard of the Maruts, close knit to
Varuna and Child of Mitra,—
As such, accepting gifts which here we offer, receive, O Godlike
Chariot, these oblations. {#29:54}

Send forth thy voice aloud through earth and heaven, and
let the world in all its breadth regard thee;
O Drum, accordant with the Gods and Indra, drive thou
afar, yea, very far, our foemen. {#29:55}

[pg 254]

Thunder out strength and fill us fall of vigour: yea, thunder
forth and drive away all dangers.
Drive hence, O War-drum, drive away misfortune: thou art
the Fist of Indra: show thy firmness. {#29:56}

Drive hither those, and these again bring hither: the
War-drum speaks aloud as battle's signal.
Our heroes, winged with horses, come together. Let our
car-warriors, Indra, be triumphant. {#29:57}

The black-necked victim belongs to Agni; the ewe to
Sarasvatī; the brown victim is Soma's; the dusky Pūshan's;
the white-backed is Brihaspati's; the dappled belongs to
the All-Gods; the red to Indra; the spotted to the Maruts;
the strong-bodied to Indra-Agni; one with white marks below
to Savitar; to Varuna a black ram with one white foot {#29:58}

To Agni Anīkavān is sacrificed a red-marked ox; two with
white spots below are for Savitar; two with silvery navels
for Pūshan; two yellow hornless he-goats for the All-Gods;
a spotted one for the Maruts; the black-faced he-goat is
Agni's; the ewe is Sarasvatī's; the ram is Varuna's. {#29:59}

To Agni of the Gāyatrī, of the Trivrit hymn and of the
Rathantara Sāman is to be offered a rice-cake on eight
potsherds; to Indra of the Trishtup, the Pañchadasa
hymn and the Brihat Sāman one on eleven potsherds; to
the All-Gods of the Jagatī, the Seventeenfold hymn
and the Vairūpa Sāman, one on twelve potsherds; to
Mitra-Varuna of the Anushtup, the Ekavimsa hymn, and
the Vairāja Sāman, a mess of curdled milk; to Brihaspati
of the Pankti metre, the Trinava hymn, and the Sākvara
Sāman, an oblation of rice boded in milk; to Savitar of
the Ushnih, the Thirty-threefold hymn, and the Raivata
Sāman, a rice-cake on eight potsherds; a mess of boiled
rice is to be made for Prajāpati; the same for Vishnu's
Consort Aditi; to Agni Vaisvānara is to be offered a
rice-cake on twelve potsherds, and to Anumati one on eight. {#29:60}

[pg 260]

## BOOK THE THIRTY-FIRST. {#31}

PURUSHA hath a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a
thousand feet.
Pervading earth on every side he fills a space ten fingers
broad.

Purusha is in truth this All, what hath been and what yet
shall be;
Lord, too, of immortality which waxes greater still by food. {#31:2}

So mighty in his grandeur; yea, greater than this is Purusha.
All creatures are one fourth of him, three fourths eternal
life in heaven. {#31:3}

[pg 261]

With three fourths Purusha rose up: one fourth of him
again was here.
Thence he moved forth to every side over what eats not
and what eats. {#31:4}

From him Virāj was born; again Purusha from Virāj was
born.
When born, he spread to west and east beyond the boundaries
of earth. {#31:5}

From that great General Sacrifice the dripping fat was
gathered up.
He formed the creatures of the air and animals both wild
and tame. {#31:6}

From that great General Sacrifice Richas and Sāma hymns
were born:
Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus
had its birth from it. {#31:7}

From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows
of teeth
From it were generated kine, from it were goats and sheep
produced. {#31:8}

They balmed as victim on the grass Purusha born in earliest
time.
With him the Deities and all Sādhyas and Rishis sacrificed. {#31:9}

When they divided Purusha how many portions did they
make?[pg 262]
What was his mouth? what were his arms? what are the
names of thighs and feet? {#31:10}

The Brāhman was his mouth, of both his arms was the
Rājanya made.
His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sūdra was
produced. {#31:11}

The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye
the Sun had birth;
Vāyu and Prāna from his ear, and from his mouth was Agni
born. {#31:12}

Forth from his navel came mid-air; the sky was fashioned
from his head;
Earth from his feet, and from his ear the Quarters. Thus
they formed the worlds. {#31:13}

When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as offering
Spring was the butter, Autumn the oblation, Summer was
the wood. {#31:14}

Then seven were his enclosing-sticks, his kindling-brands
were three times seven,
When Gods, performing sacrifice, bound as their victim
Purusha. {#31:15}

Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim: these were the earliest
holy ordinances.
The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where
the Sādhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling. {#31:16}

[pg 263]

In the beginning he was formed, collected from waters, earth,
and Visvakarman's essence.
Fixing the form thereof Tvashtar proceedeth. This was at
first the mortal's birth and godhead. {#31:17}

I know this mighty Purusha whose colour is like the Sun,
beyond the reach of darkness.
He only who knows him leaves Death behind him. There is
no path save this alone to travel. {#31:18}

In the womb moves Prajāpati: he, never becoming born, is
born in sundry figures.
The wise discern the womb from which he springeth. In
him alone stand all existing creatures. {#31:19}

He who gives light and heat to Gods, first, foremost Agent
of the Gods,
Born ere the Gods—to him the bright, the holy One, be
reverence {#31:20}

Thus spake the Gods at first, as they begat the bright and
holy One:
The Brahman who may know thee thus shall have the Gods
in his control. {#31:21}

Beauty and Fortune are thy wives: each side of thee are
Day and Night.
The constellations are thy form: the Asvins are thine open
jaws.
Wishing, wish yonder world for me, wish that the Universe
be mine. {#31:22}

## BOOK THE THIRTY-SECOND. {#32}

AGNI is That; the Sun is That; Vāyu and Chandramās are
That.
The Bright is That; Brahma is That, those Waters, that
Prajāpati.

All twinklings of the eyelid sprang from Purusha,
resplendent One.
No one hath comprehended him above, across, or in the
midst. {#32:2}

There is no counterpart of him whose glory verily is great.
In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, etc. Let not him
harm me, etc. Than whom there is no other born, etc. {#32:3}

This very God pervadeth all the regions; yea, born aforetime,
in the womb he dwelleth.
He verily born and to be born hereafter meeteth his offspring,
facing all directions. {#32:4}

Before whom naught whatever sprang to being; who with
his presence aids all living creatures,
Prajāpati, rejoicing in his offspring, he, Shodasī, maintains
the Three great Lustres. {#32:5}

By whom the heavens are strong and earth stands firmly,
by whom light's realm and sky-vault are supported;
By whom the regions in mid-air were measured. What
God shall we adore with our oblation? {#32:6}

[pg 265]

To whom, supported by his help, two armies embattled look
while trembling in their spirit,
Where over them the risen Sun is shining. What God shall
we adore with our oblation?
What time the mighty waters, etc. He in his might surveyed, etc. {#32:7}

The Sage beholdeth That mysterious Being wherein this
All hath found one only dwelling.
Therein unites the Whole, and thence it issues: far-spread it
is the warp and woof in creatures. {#32:8}

Knowing Eternity, may the Gandharva declare that station,
parted, kept in secret.
Three steps thereof in mystery are hidden: he who knows
these shall be the father's father. {#32:9}

He is our kin, our Father and Begetter: he knows all beings
and all Ordinances,
In whom the Gods obtaining life eternal have risen upward
to the third high station. {#32:10}

Having encompassed round existing creatures, the world;
and all the Quarters and Mid-quarters,
Having approached the first-born Child of Order he with his
Self into The Self hath entered. {#32:11}

[pg 266]

Having gone swiftly round the earth and heaven, around
the worlds, around the sky, the Quarters,
Having spread out the lengthened thread of Order, he views,
and he becomes and is That Being. {#32:12}

To the Assembly's wondrous Lord, to Indra's lovely Friend
who gives
Wisdom. have I drawn near in prayer. {#32:13}

That wisdom which the Companies of Gods, and Fathers,
recognize,
Even with that intelligence, O Agni, make me wise to-day.
All-hail! {#32:14}

Varuna grant me wisdom! grant it Agni and Prajāpati!
Wisdom may Indra, Vāyu grant. May the Creator grant it
me. All-hail! {#32:15}

Let these the Priests and Nobles both enjoy the splendour
that is mine.
Best splendour may the Gods bestow on me. To thee, that
splendour, hail! {#32:16}

* * *

[pg 267]

## BOOK THE THIRTY-THIRD. {#33}

His be the fires, eternal, purifying, protectors of our homes,
whose smoke is shining,
White, waxing in their strength, for ever stirring, and seated
in the wood: like winds are Somas.

Gold-coloured, bannered with the smoke, urged by the wind,
aloft to heaven
Rise, lightly borne, the flames of fire.
Bring to us Mitra-Varuna, bring the Gods to the great
sacrifice;
Bring them, O Agni, to thine home. {#33:2}

Yoke, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invoke the
Gods:
As ancient Hotar take thy seat. {#33:4}

To fair goals travel Two unlike in semblance: each in
succession nourishes an infant.
One bears a Godlike Babe of golden colour: bright and
fair-shining is be with the other. {#33:5}

Here by ordainers was this God appointed first Invoker,
best at worship, to be praised at rites,
Whom Apnavāna and the Bhrigus caused to shine,
bright-coloured in the wood, spreading to every house. {#33:6}

Three times a hundred Gods, and thrice a thousand, and
three times ten, and nine have worshipped Agni,
For him spread sacred grass, balmed him with butter, and
stablished him as Priest and Sacrificer. {#33:7}

[pg 268]

Him, messenger of earth and head of heaven, Agni Vaisvānara,
born in holy Order,
The Sage, the King, the Guest of men, a vessel fit for their
mouths, the Gods have generated. {#33:8}

May Agni slay the foemen,—fain for riches, through the
love of song
Kindled, bright, served with sacrifice. {#33:9}

With the All-Gods, with Indra and with Vāyu drink the
Soma mead,
O Agni, after Mitra's laws. {#33:10}

When splendour reached the Lord of men to speed him,
down from the heaven was shed the brilliant moisture.
Agni brought forth to light and filled with spirit the youthful
host benevolent and blameless. {#33:11}

Show thyself strong for mighty bliss, O Agni; most excellent
be thine effulgent splendours.
Make easy to maintain our household lordship and trample
down the might of those who hate us. {#33:12}

We have elected thee as most delightful for thy beams’
glow: hear our great laud, O Agni.
The best men praise thee as the peer of Indra in strength,
mid Gods, like Vāyu in thy bounty. {#33:13}

O Agni who art worshipped well, dear let our princes be to
thee,
Our wealthy patrons who are governors of men, who part in
gifts their stalls of kine. {#33:14}

[pg 269]

Hear, Agni who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of
escort Gods.
Let Mitra, Aryaman, seeking betimes our rite, seat them
upon the sacred grass. {#33:15}

The Freedom of all Gods who merit worship, freely received
as Guest in all men's houses,
Agni who hath secured the Gods’ high favour, may he be
gracious to us, Jātavedas. {#33:16}

In great enkindled Agni's keeping and, for bliss, free from
all sin before Mitra and Varuna,
May we share Savitar's best animating help. We crave this
gracious favour of the Gods to-day. {#33:17}

Like barren cows, moreover, swelled the waters: singers
approached thy holy cult, O Indra.
Come thou to us as to his team comes Vāyu. Thou through
our solemn hymns bestowest bounty. {#33:18}

Ye Cows, protect the fount. The two mighty Ones bless the
sacrifice.
The handles twain are wrought of gold. {#33:19}

Now when the Sun hath risen to-day may sinless Mitra,
Aryaman,
Bhaga, and Savitar speed us forth. {#33:20}

Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the
heaven and earth;[pg 270]
Supply the liquid to the Bull.
Thou in the first old time. See, Vena. {#33:21}

As he was rising up they all revered him: self-luminous he
travels, clothed in splendour.
That is the Bull's, the Asura's lofty nature: he, Omniform,
hath reached the eternal waters. {#33:22}

I laud your Mighty One who joyeth in the juice, him who
is good to all men, who pervadeth all;
Indra whose conquering strength is powerful in war, whose
fame and manly vigour Heaven and Earth revere. {#33:23}

Great is their fuel, strung their laud, wide is their sacrificial
post
Whose Friend is Indra, ever young. {#33:24}

Come, Indra, and delight thee with the juice at all the
Soma feasts,
Conqueror, mighty in thy strength. {#33:25}

Leading his band, Indra encompassed Vritra; weak grew
the wily leader of enchanters.
He who burns fierce in forests slaughtered Vyamsa, and
made the milch-kine of the nights apparent. {#33:26}

Whence comest thou alone, thou who art mighty, Indra,
Lord of the Brave? What is thy purpose?
Thou greetest us, encountering us the Bright Ones. Lord of
Bay Steeds, say what thou hast against us.
Indra, great in his power and might. Ne’er art thou fruitless.
Never art thou neglectful. {#33:27}

[pg 271]

Those men extolled that deed of thine, O Indra, those who
would fain burst through the stall of cattle,
Fain to milk her who bare but once, great, lofty, whose sons
are many and her streams a thousand. {#33:28}

To thee the Mighty One I bring this mighty hymn, for thy
desire hath been gratified by my laud.
In Indra, yea, in him victorious through his might, the
Gods have joyed at feast and when the Soma flowed. {#33:29}

May the Bright God drink glorious Soma-mingled mead,
giving the sacrifice's lord uninjured life;
He who, wind-urged, in person guard our offspring well,
hath nourished them with food and shone o’er many a
land. {#33:30}

His bright rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all
that lives,
Sūrya, that all may look on him. {#33:31}

Pure Varuna, with that same eye wherewith thou lookest
upon one
Actively stirring mid the folk— {#33:32}

Ye two divine Adhvaryus, come hither upon a sun-bright car:
Bedew our sacrifice with stead.
Thou in the first old time. See, Vena. The brilliant presence. {#33:33}

Loved of all men, may Savitar through praises offered as
sacred food come to our synod,
That ye too, through our hymns, ye ever youthful, may
gladden at your visit all our people. {#33:34}

[pg 272]

Whatever, Vritra-slayer! thou Surya hast risen on to-day,
That, Indra, all is in thy power. {#33:35}

Swift, visible to all art thou, O Sūrya, maker of the light,
Illuming all the radiant realm. {#33:36}

This is the Godhead, this the might of Sūrya: he hath
withdrawn what spread o’er work unfinished.
When he hath loosed his horses from their station, straight
over all Night spreadeth out her garment. {#33:37}

In the sky's lap the Sun this form assumeth that Varuna
and Mitra may behold it.
His Bay Steeds well maintain their power eternal, at one
time bright, and darksome at another. {#33:38}

Verily, Sūrya, thou art great; truly, Āditya, thou art great.
As thou art great indeed thy greatness is admired: yea,
verily thou, God, art great. {#33:39}

Yea, Sūrya, thou art great in fame: thou, evermore, O God,
art great.
Thou by thy greatness art the Gods’ Home-Priest, divine,
far-spread, unconquerable light. {#33:40}

Turning, as ’twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all
good things.
When he who will be horn is born with power we look to
treasures as our heritage. {#33:41}

To-day, ye Gods, when Sūrya hath ascended, deliver us
front trouble and dishonour.
This boon may Varuna and Mitra grant us, and Aditi and
Sindhu, Earth and Heaven. {#33:42}

[pg 273]

Throughout the dusky firmament advancing, laying to rest
the immortal and the mortal,
Borne on his golden chariot he cometh, Savitar, God,
beholding living creatures. {#33:43}

Soft to the tread the sacred grass is scattered: these go
like Kings amid the band around them,
At the folk's early call on Night and Morning,—Vāyu, and
Pūshan with his team to bless us. {#33:44}

Indra, Vāyu, Brihaspati, Mitra, Agni, Pūshan, Bhaga,
Ādityas, and the Marut host. {#33:45}

Be Varuna our chief defence, let Mitra guard us with all aids:
Both make us rich exceedingly! {#33:46}

Regard us, Indra, Vishnu, here, ye Asvins, and the Marut
host, us who are kith and kin to you.
Thou in the first old time. See, Vena. O ye eleven Gods.
Loved of all men, may Savitar. With the All-Gods. Ye
Visvedevas who protect. {#33:47}

O Agni, Indra, Varuna, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and
Marut host, and Vishnu.
May both Nāsatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pūshan,
Sarasvatī, Bhaga accept us. {#33:48}

Indra, Agni, Mitra, Varuna, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains,
Maruts, Sky, and Earth and Heaven,
Vishnu I call, Pūshan and Brahmanaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa,
Savitar that they may help. {#33:49}

With us are raining Rudras, clouds accordant in call to
battle at the death of Vritra,
The strong, assigned to him who sings and praises. May
Gods with Indra as their chief protect us. {#33:50}

[pg 274]

Turn yourselves hitherward this day, ye Holy, that fearing
in my heart I may approach you.
Protect us, Gods, let not the wolf destroy us. Save us, ye
Holy, from the pit and falling. {#33:51}

This day come all the Maruts, etc., as in XVIII. 31. {#33:52}

Listen, All-Gods, to this mine invocation, ye who inhabit
heaven and air's mid-region.
All ye; O Holy Ones, whose tongue is Agni, seated upon
this sacred grass be joyful. {#33:53}

For thou at first producest for the holy Gods the noblest of
all portions, immortality.
Thereafter as a gift to men, O Savitar, thou openest existence,
life succeeding life. {#33:54}

I with a lofty song call hither Vāyu all-bounteous, filler of
his car, most wealthy.
Thou, Sage, with bright path, Lord of harnessed horses,
impetuous, promptly honourest the prudent. {#33:55}

These, Indra-Vāyu, have been shed, etc., as in VII. 8. {#33:56}

Mitra of holy strength I call, and foe-destroying Varuna,
Who make the oil-fed rite complete. {#33:57}

Nāsatyas, Wonder-workers, yours are these libations with
clipt grass.
Come ye whose paths are bright with glow. {#33:58}

When Saramā had, found the mountain's fissure, that vast
and ancient place she plundered thoroughly.
In the floods’ van she led them forth, light-footed: she who
well knew came first unto their lowing. {#33:59}

[pg 275]

For nowhere did they find another envoy to lead the way
than this Vaisvānara Agni.
The Gods immortal strengthened the immortal Vaisvānara
to win the land in battle. {#33:60}

The strong, dispellers of the foe, Indra and Agni, we invoke:
May they be kind to one like me. {#33:61}

Sing forth to Indu, O ye men, to him as he is purified,
Fain to pay worship to the Gods. {#33:62}

Drink Soma, Indra, handed with the Maruts who, Boon
Lord! strengthened thee at Ahi's slaughter,
’Gainst Sambara, Lord of Bays! in winning cattle, and now
rejoice in thee, the holy singers. {#33:63}

Thou vast born mighty for victorious valour, exulting,
strongest, full of pride and courage.
There, even there the Maruts strengthened Indra when his
most rapid Mother stirred the Hero. {#33:64}

O thou who slewest Vritra, come, O Indra, hither to our side,
Mighty One with thy mighty aids. {#33:65}

Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.
Father art thou, all-conquering, cancelling the curse: vanquish
the men who fight with us. {#33:66}

Heaven and Earth cling close to thy victorious might
As sire and mother to their child. {#33:67}

The sacrifice obtains the Gods’ acceptance, etc., as in VIII. 4. {#33:68}

Protect our habitation, Savitar, this day with guardian
aids around, propitious, ne’er beguiled.
God of the golden tongue, keep us for newest bliss: let not
the evil-wisher have us in his power. {#33:69}

[pg 276]

For you have flowed, through noble ministration, pressed
by Adhvaryus, bright sweet-flavoured juices.
Drive on thy team and come thou hither, Vāyu: drink for
thy rapture of the sap of Soma. {#33:70}

Ye Cows, protect, etc., as in verse 14. {#33:71}

Come ye foe-slayers to the place of meeting, to the
birth-places of the two great Sages,
With force of intellect unto the dwelling. {#33:72}

Ye two divine Adhvaryus, etc., as in verse 33. Thou in
the time of old. See, Vena. {#33:73}

Transversely was the severing line extended: was it above,
or was it, haply, under?
There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action
here and energy up yonder. {#33:74}

He hath filled heaven and earth and the great realm of light,
when at his birth the skilful held him in their hold.
He like a steed is led forth to the sacrifice, Sage, graciously
inclined, that he may win us wealth. {#33:75}

Call hither with the song and lauds the two best slayers of
the foe,
Delighting even in our hymn. {#33:76}

All Sons of Immortality shall listen to the songs we sing,
And be exceeding good to us. {#33:77}

Mine are devotions, hymns, sweet are libations. Strength
stirs, and hurled forth is my rocky weapon.
They call for me, for me their lauds are longing. To their
libations these my Bay Steeds bear me. {#33:78}

[pg 277]

Nothing, O Bounteous Lord, stands firm before thee: among
the Gods not one is found thine equal.
None born or springing into life comes near thee. Do what
thou hast to do, exceeding mighty! {#33:79}

In all the worlds That was the Best and Highest whence
sprang the mighty God of splendid valour.
Quickly when born he overcomes his foemen, he in whom
all who lend him aid are joyful. {#33:80}

May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast
abundant wealth.
Men skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have
sung them with their lauds to thee. {#33:81}

Good Lord of wealth is he to whom all Āryas, Dāsas here
belong.
E’en over unto thee, the pious Rusama Pavīru, is that
wealth brought nigh. {#33:82}

He, with his might advanced by Rishis thousandfold, hath
like an ocean spread himself.
His majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power
where holy singers rule. {#33:83}

84\. Protect our habitation, Savitar, etc., as in verse 69.

Come, Vāyu, drawn by fair hymns, to our sacrifice that
reaches heaven.
Poured on the middle of the straining-cloth and dressed,
this bright drink hath been offered thee. {#33:85}

Indra and Vāyu, fair to see and swift to hear, we call to us,
That in assembly all, yea, all the folk may be benevolent to
us and free from malady. {#33:86}

[pg 278]

Yea, specially that mortal man hath toiled for service of
the Gods,
Who quickly hath brought near Mitra and Varuna to share
his sacrificial gifts. {#33:87}

Approach ye, and be near to us. Drink, O ye Asvins, of
the mead.
Draw forth the milk, ye mighty, rich in genuine wealth!
Injure us not, and come to us. {#33:38}

May Brahmanaspati draw nigh, may Sūnritā the Goddess
come,
And Gods bring to our rite which gives the fivefold gift the
Hero, lover of mankind. {#33:89}

Within the Waters runs the Moon, he with the beauteous
wings, in heaven.
To yellow-hued abundant wealth, object of many a man's
desire, loud-neighing goes the tawny Steed. {#33:90}

Singing their praise with godlike hymn let us invoke each
God for grace,
Each God to bring you help, each God to strengthen you. {#33:91}

Agni Vaisvānara, set in heaven, with mighty splendour
hath shone forth.
Increasing in his power on earth, benevolent, he quells the
darkness with his light. {#33:92}

First, Indra Agni! hath this Maid come footless unto those
with feet.
Stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue,
she hath gone downward thirty steps. {#33:93}

[pg 279]

For of one spirit are the Gods with mortal man, co-sharers
all of gracious gifts.
May they increase our strength hereafter and to-day, providing
ease and ample room. {#33:94}

Indra who quells the curse blew curses far away, and then
in splendour came to us.
Indra, refulgent with the Marut host! the Gods eagerly
strove to win thy love. {#33:95}

To Indra, to your mighty Chief, Maruts, sing forth a mighty
prayer.
Let Satakratu, Vritra-slayer, kill the fiend with hundred-knotted
thunderbolt. {#33:96}

Indra increased his manly strength at sacrifice, in the wild
rapture of this juice;
And living men to-day, even as of old, sing forth their
praises to his majesty.
May these. Good Lord of wealth. He with his might.
Stand up erect. {#33:97}

[pg 280]

## BOOK THE THIRTY-FOURTH. {#34}

THAT which, divine, mounts far when man is waking, that
which returns to him when he is sleeping,
The lights’ one light that goeth to a distance, may that,
my mind, be moved by right intention.

Whereby the wise and thoughtful in assemblies, active in
sacrifice, perform their duties,
The peerless spirit stored in living creatures, may that, my
mind, be moved by right intention. {#34:2}

That which is wisdom, intellect, and firmness, immortal light
which creatures have within them,
That without which men do no single action, may that, my
mind, be moved by right intention. {#34:3}

Whereby, immortal, all is comprehended, the world which is,
and what shall be hereafter,
Whereby spreads sacrifice with seven Hotars, may that, my
mind, be moved by right intention. {#34:4}

Wherein the Richas, Sāmans, Yajur-verses, like spokes within
a car's nave, are included,
And all the thought of creatures is inwoven, may that, my
mind, be moved by right intention. {#34:5}

Controlling men, as, with the reins that guide them, a skilful
charioteer drives fleet-foot horses,
Which dwells within the heart, agile, most rapid, may that,
my mind, be moved by right intention. {#34:6}

Now will I glorify great strength's upholder, Food,
By whose invigorating might Trita rent Vritra limb from limb. {#34:7}

[pg 281]

Do thou, in truth, Anumati, assent and grant us happiness.
Urge us to strength and energy: prolong the days we have
to live. {#34:8}

Anumati this day approve our sacrifice among the Gods!
Oblation-bearing Agni be, and thou, bliss to the worshipper! {#34:9}

O broad-tressed Sinīvālī, thou who art the sister of the Gods,
Accept the offered sacrifice, and, Goddess, grant us progeny. {#34:10}

Five rivers flowing on their way speed onward to Sarasvatī,
But then became Sarasvatī a fivefold river in the land. {#34:11}

O Agni, thou the earliest Angiras, the Seer, hast, God thyself,
become the Gods’ auspicious Friend.
After thy holy ordinance the Maruts, sage, active through
wisdom, with their glittering spears, were born. {#34:12}

Worthy to be revered, O Agni, God, preserve our wealthy
patrons with thy succours, and ourselves.
Guard art thou of our seed and progeny and cows, incessantly
protecting in thy holy law. {#34:15}

Lay this with care on her who lies extended: straight, when
impregned, hath she brought forth the Hero.
With his bright pillar—radiant is his lustre—in our skilled
task is born the Son of Idā. {#34:14}

In Idā's place, the centre of the earth, will we deposit thee,
That, Agni Jātavedas, thou mayst bear our offerings to the
Gods. {#34:15}

Like Angiras a gladdening laud we ponder to him who loveth
song, exceeding mighty.
Let us sing glory to the far-famed Hero who must be praised
with fair hymns by the singer. {#34:16}

[pg 282]

Unto the Great One bring great adoration, a chant of praise
to him the very potent,
Through whom our sires, Angirases, singing praises, and
knowing well the places, found the cattle. {#34:17}

The friends who offer Soma long to find thee: they pour
forth Soma and present their viands.
They bear, Unmoved, the cursing of the people, for all our
wisdom comes from thee, O Indra. {#34:18}

Not far for thee are mid-air's loftiest regions: start hither,
Lord of Bays, with both Bay Horses.
Pressed for the Firm and Strong are these libations. The
pressing-stones are set, the fire is kindled. {#34:19}

Invincible in fight, saviour in battles, guard of our camp,
winner of light and water,
Born amid hymns, well-housed, exceeding famous, victor, in
thee may we rejoice, O Soma. {#34:20}

To him who worships Soma gives a milch cow, a fleet steed,
and a man of active knowledge,
Skilled in home duties, competent in council, meet for the
court, the glory of his father. {#34:21}

These herbs, these milch-kine, and these running waters, all
these, O Soma, thou hast generated.
The spacious firmament hast thou expanded, and with the
light thou hast dispelled the darkness. {#34:22}

Do thou, God Soma, with thy God-like spirit, victorious,
win for us a share of riches.
Let none prevent thee: thou art Lord of valour. Provide
for these and those in fight for cattle. {#34:23}

The earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three
desert regions, and the Seven Rivers.[pg 283]
God Savitar the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice
treasures to the man who worships. {#34:24}

Savitar, golden-handed, swiftly moving, goes on his way
between the earth and heaven,
Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads
the bright sky through the darksome region. {#34:25}

May, he, gold-handed Asura, kind leader, come hitherward
to us with help and favour.
Driving off Rākshasas and Yātudhānas, the God is present,
praised in hymns at evening. {#34:26}

O Savitar, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established
in the air's mid-region.
O God, come by those paths so fair to travel: preserve thou
us from harm this day and bless us. {#34:27}

Drink our libations, Asvins twain, grant us protection, both
of you,
With aids which none may interrupt. {#34:28}

Make ye our speech effectual, O Asvins, and this our hymn,
ye mighty Wonder-workers.
In luckless game I call on you for succour: strengthen us
also on the field of battle. {#34:29}

With undiminished blessings, O ye Asvins, through days and
nights on every side protect us.
This prayer of ours may Varuna grant, and Mitra, and Aditi
and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven. {#34:30}

Throughout the dusky firmament, etc., as in XXXIII. 43. {#34:31}

Night! the terrestrial realm hath been filled with the
Father's power and might.
Thou spreadest thee on high unto the seats of heaven: terrific
darkness cometh nigh. {#34:32}

[pg 284]

O Dawn enriched with ample wealth, bestow on us that
wondrous gift
Wherewith we may support children and children's sons. {#34:33}

Agni at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuna
and Mitra and the Asvins twain,
Bhaga at dawn, Pūshan and Brahmanaspati, Soma at dawn,
Rudra may we invoke at dawn. {#34:34}

May we invoke strong early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of
Aditi, the great Arranger,
Thinking of whom the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the
King says, Let me share in Bhaga. {#34:35}

Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this
prayer and give us wealth, O Bhaga.
Bhaga, increase our store of kine and horses: Bhaga, may
we be rich in men and heroes. {#34:36}

So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day
approaches, and at noontide;
And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in
the Deities’ loving-kindness. {#34:37}

May Bhaga verily he Bliss-bestower, and through him,
Gods! may happiness attend us.
As such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be
thou our Champion here, O Bhaga. {#34:38}

To this our worship may the Dawns incline them, and come
to the pure place like Dadhikrāvan.
As strong steeds draw a chariot shay they bring us hitherward
Bhaga who discovers treasure. {#34:39}

May friendly Mornings dawn on us for ever, with wealth of
kine, of horses, and of heroes,
Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve
us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#34:40}

[pg 285]

Secure in thy protecting care, O Pūshan, never may we fail:
We here are singers of thy praise. {#34:41}

I praise with eloquence hire who guards all pathways. He,
when his love impelled him, went to Arka.
May he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it: may Pūshan
make each prayer of ours effective. {#34:42}

Vishnu the undeceivable Protector strode three steps, thenceforth
Establishing his high decrees. {#34:43}

This, Vishnu's station most sublime, the singers ever vigilant.
Lovers of holy song, light up. {#34:44}

Filled full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide,
spacious, dropping meath, beautiful in their form,
The Heaven and the Earth by Varuna's decree, unwasting,
rich in seed, stand parted each from each. {#34:45}

Let those who are our foemen stand afar from us: with
Indra and with Agni we will drive them off.
Vasus, Ādityas, Rudras have exalted me, made me preëminent,
mighty, thinker, sovran lord. {#34:46}

Come, O Nāsatyas, with the thrice eleven Gods: come,
O ye Asvins, to the drinking of the meath.
Prolong our days of life, and wipe out all our sins: ward off
our enemies; be with us evermore. {#34:47}

May this your praise, may this your song, O Maruts, sung
by the poet, Māna's son, Māndārya,[pg 286]
Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we
find strengthening food in full abundance. {#34:48}

They who were versed in ritual and metre, in hymns and
rules, were the Seven godlike Rishis.
Viewing the path of those of old, the sages have taken up
the reins like chariot-drivers. {#34:49}

Bestowing splendour, length of life, increase of wealth, and
conquering power,
This brightly shining gold shall be attached to me for victory. {#34:50}

This gold no demons injure, no Pisāchas; for this is might
of Gods, their primal offspring.
Whoever wears the gold of Daksha's children lives a long life
among the Gods, lives a long life among mankind. {#34:51}

This ornament of gold which Daksha's children bound, with
benevolent thoughts, on Satānīka,
I bind on me for life through hundred autumns, that I may
live till ripe old age o’ertakes me. {#34:52}

Let Ahibudhnya also hear our calling, and Aja-Ekapād and
Earth and Ocean.[pg 287]
All Gods Law-strengtheners, invoked and lauded, and Texts
recited by the sages, help us! {#34:53}

These hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever
offer to the Kings Ādityas.
May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varuna,
Daksha, and Amsa. {#34:54}

Seven Rishis are established in the body: seven guard it
evermore with care unceasing.
Seven waters seek the world of him who lies asleep: two
sleepless Gods are feast-fellows of him who wakes. {#34:55}

O Brahmanaspati, arise. God-fearing men, we pray to thee.
May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra,
be thou most swift with them. {#34:56}

Now Brahmanaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn
of praise.
Wherein Indra and Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods have
made their dwelling-place. {#34:57}

O Brahmanaspati, be thou controller of this our hymn, and
prosper thou our children.
All that the Gods regard with love is blessèd. Loud may
we speak, with brave sons, in assembly.
He who sate down. Mighty in mind. Father who made us.
A share of good, O Lord of Food. {#34:58}

## BOOK THE THIRTY-FIFTH. {#35}

BEGONE the Panis, hence away, rebellious, scorners of the
Gods!
The place is his who poured the juice.

Let Savitar approve a spot upon the earth for thy remains:
And let the bulls be yoked for it. {#35:2}

Let Vāyu purify. Let Savitar purify. With Agni's glitter.
With Savitar's lustre. Let the bulls be unyoked. {#35:3}

The Holy Fig Tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna
Tree:
Winners of cattle shall ye be if ye regain for me this man. {#35:4}

Let Savitar lay down thy bones committed to the Mother's
lap.
Be pleasant to this man, O Earth. {#35:5}

Here in the God Prajāpati, near water, Man, I lay thee down:
May his light drive mishap from us. {#35:6}

Go hence, O Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from
that which Gods are wont to travel.
To thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: Touch not our
offspring, injure not our heroes. {#35:7}

[pg 289]

Pleasant to thee be wind and sun, and pleasant be the bricks
to thee.
Pleasant to thee be the terrestrial fires: let them not scorch
thee in their flames. {#35:8}

Prosper for thee the regions and the waters, and let the seas
for thee be most propitious.
Auspicious unto thee be Air. Prosper all Quarters well for
thee! {#35:9}

On flows the stony flood: hold fast each other, keep yourselves
up, my friends, and pass the river.
Here let us leave the powers that brought no profit, and
cross the flood to Powers that are auspicious. {#35:10}

Drive away evil, drive away fault, sorcery, and guiltiness.
Do thou, O Apāmārga, drive the evil dream away from us. {#35:11}

To us let waters and the plants be friendly, to him who
hates us, whom we hate, unfriendly. {#35:12}

For our prosperity we touch the ox the son of Surabhi.
Be bearer and deliverer to us as Indra to the Gods. {#35:13}

Looking upon the loftiest light, etc., as in XX. 21. {#35:14}

Here I erect this rampart for the living: let none of these,
none other, reach this limit.
May they survive a hundred lengthened autumns, and may
they bury Death beneath this mountain. {#35:15}

Agni, thou pourest life, etc., as in XIX. 38. {#35:16}

[pg 290]

Waxing with sacrifice live long, O Agni, with butter on thy
face and homed in fatness.
When thou hast drunk the cows’ fair savoury butter, guard,
as a father guards his son, these people. {#35:17}

These men have led about the ox, have duly carried Agni
round,
And raised their glory to the Gods. Who will attack them
with success? {#35:18}

I drive Corpse-eating Agni to a distance: sin-laden let him
go to Yama's kingdom.
Here let this other, Jātavedas, carry oblation to the Deities,
foreknowing. {#35:19}

Carry the fat to Fathers, Jātavedas, where, far away, thou
knowest, them established.
Let rivulets of marrow flow to meet them, and let their
truthful wishes be accomplished. All-hail! {#35:20}

Pleasant be thou to us, O Earth, without a thorn, our
resting-place.
Vouchsafe us shelter reaching far. May thy light drive
mishap from us. {#35:21}

Born art thou, Agni, from this man: let him again be born
from thee,
For Svarga's world, the man I name. All-hail! {#35:22}

REFUGE I take in Speech as Rich: refuge in Mind as
Yajus-text; refuge in Breath as Sāma-chant; refuge in
Hearing and in Sight.
Speech-energy endowed with strength, inbreath and
outbreath are in me.

Whatever deeply-sunk defect I have of eye, or mind, or

Pleasantly blow the wind for us, may Sūrya warm us
pleasantly.
Pleasantly, with a roar, the God Parjanya send the rain on us. {#36:10}

May days pass pleasantly for us, may nights draw near
delightfully.
Befriend us with their aids Indra and Agni, Indra and
Varuna who taste oblations.
Indra and Pūshan be our help in battle, Indra and Soma
give health, strength, and comfort. {#36:11}

May the celestial Waters, our helpers, be sweet for us to drink,
And flow with health and strength to us. {#36:12}

Caldron, strengthen me. May all beings regard me with the
eye of a friend. May I regard all beings with the eye of
a friend.
With the eye of a friend do we regard one another. {#36:18}

Do thou, O Caldron, strengthen me. Long may I live to
look on thee. Long may I live to look on thee. {#36:19}

Obeisance to thy wrath and glow, etc., as in XXII. 11. {#36:20}

Homage to thee the lightning flash, homage to thee the
thunder's roar!
Homage, O Bounteous Lord, to thee whereas thou fain
wouldst win to heaven! {#36:21}

From whatsoever trouble thou desirest, give us safety thence.
Give to our children happiness and to our beasts security. {#36:22}

To us let Waters and let Plants be friendly, etc., as in VI. 23. {#36:23}

Through hundred autumns may we see that bright Eye,
God-appointed, rise,
A hundred autumns may we live.
Through hundred autumns may we hear; through hundred
autumns clearly speak: through hundred autumns live
content; a hundred autumns, yea, beyond a hundred
autumns may we see. {#36:21}

Gods sacrificed.
For Makha thee, thee for the head of Makha! {#37:5}

Indra's effective might are ye. Duly may I prepare for you

He shines on earth upholder of the sky and heat, the Gods
upholder, God, immortal, born of heat.
To him address a speech devoted to the Gods. {#37:16}

I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching

He, clothed with gathered and diffusive splendour, within
the worlds continually travels. {#37:17}

Lord of all earths, Lord of all mind, Lord of all speech,

thee. Do not thou harm us.
May we, accompanied by Tvashtar, win thee. Vouchsafe me
sons and cattle. Grant us offspring. Safe may I be together
with my husband. {#37:20}

May Day together with his sheen, pair-lighted with his light,
accept. All-hail!
May Night together with her sheen, fair lighted with her.
light, accept. All-hail! {#37:21}

## BOOK THE THIRTY-EIGHTH. {#38}

BY impulse of God Savitar I take thee with arms of Asvins,
with the Hands of Pūshan.
A zone for Aditi art thou.

Idā, come hither. Aditi, come hither. Sarasvatī, come
hither.
Come hither, So-and-So. Come hither, So-and-So. Come
hither, So-and-So. {#38:2}

Thou art a zone for Aditi, a diadem for Indrānī. Pūshan art
thou. Spare some for the Gharma. {#38:3}

Overflow for the Asvins. Overflow for Sarasvatī. Overflow
for Indra
All-hail, what belongs to Indra! All-hail, what belongs to
Indra! All-hail, what belongs to Indra! {#38:4}

That breast of thine, exhaustless, fount of pleasure, wealth-giver,
treasure-finder, free-bestower,
Wherewith thou rearest all things that are choicest,—bring
that, Sarasvatī, that we may drain it.
Throughout the spacious middle air I travel. {#38:5}

Thou art Gāyatra metre. Thou art Trishtup metre. With
Heaven and Earth I grasp thee. With the Firmament I
raise thee up.
Indra and Asvins, drink ye the hot draught of sweet honey:
sacrifice, ye Vasus. Vāt! All-hail to the rain-winning
beam of the Sun! {#38:6}

[pg 298]

the flood.

mead. {#38:10}

In heaven lay thou this sacrifice; lay thou this sacrifice in
heaven.
To sacrificial Agni hail! May bliss be ours from Yajus texts. {#38:11}

Drink, Asvins, with your daily helps, the Gharma, strengthener
of hearts.
To him who draweth out the thread be homage, and to
Heaven and Earth. {#38:12}

The Gharma have the Asvins drunk: with Heaven and
Earth have they agreed.
Here, verily, be their boons bestowed. {#38:13}

Overflow for food. Overflow for energy. Overflow for the
Priesthood. Overflow for the Nobility. Overflow for

Homage to thee, divine Gharma! Do not thou injure me. {#38:16}

Thy far-spread majesty, instinct with wisdom, hath
surpassed this heaven,
And, with its glorious fame, the earth.
Seat thee, for thou art mighty: shine, best entertainer of
the Gods.
Worthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke ruddy
and beautiful to see. {#38:17}

Gharma, that heavenly light of thine in Gāyatrī, in the
Soma-store,—
May it increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.
Gharma, that light of thine in air, in Trishtup, in the sacred
hearth,—
May it increase and be confirmed for thee, that light.
Gharma, that light of thine on earth, in Jagatī, of the priest's
shed,—
May that increase and be confirmed for thee, that light. {#38:18}

Thee for the sure protection of the Nobles. Guard thou
from injury the Brahman's body.
We follow thee in interest of the People, for the renewal of
our peace and comfort. {#38:19}

[pg 300]

Square, far-spread is the sacrifice's navel: it spreads for us
wide, full of all existence, spreads wide for us full of
complete existence.
We turn against the hate and guiles of him who keeps an
alien law. {#38:20}

This, Gharma! is thy liquid store. Swell out and wax in
strength thereby.
May we too grow in strength and wax to greatness. {#38:21}

Loudly the tawny Stallion neighed, mighty, like Mitra fair to see.
Together with the Sun the sea, the store shone out with
flashing light. {#38:22}

To us let Waters and let Plants be friendly; to him who
hates us, whom we hate, unfriendly. {#38:23}

Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come
To Sūrya, God among the Gods, the light that is most excellent. {#38:24}

A brand art thou, fain would we thrive, Fuel art thou, and
splendour: Give me splendour, {#38:25}

Far as the heaven and earth are spread in compass, far as
the Seven Rivers are extended,
So vast thy cup which I with strength am taking, Indra,
unharmed in me, uninjured ever. {#38:26}

In me be that great hero power, in me be strength and
mental force:
The Gharma shines with triple light, with lustre fulgent
far away, with holy lore, with brilliancy. {#38:27}

Brought hither is the seed of milk. Through each succeeding
year may we enjoy the bliss of draining it.
Invited, I enjoy a share of that which hath been offered me,
the savoury draught by Indra drunk and tasted by Prajāpati. {#38:28}

## BOOK THE FORTIETH. {#40}

ENVELOPED by the Lord must be This All—each thing that
moves on earth.
With that renounced enjoy thyself. Covet no wealth of
any man.

One, only doing Karma here, should wish to live a hundred
years.
No way is there for thee but this. So Karma cleaveth not
to man. {#40:2}

Aye, to the Asuras belong those worlds enwrapt in blinding
gloom.
To them, when life on earth is done, depart the men who
kill the Self. {#40:3}

[pg 305]

Motionless, one, swifter than Mind—the Devas failed to
o’ertake it speeding on before them.
It, standing still, outstrips the others running. Herein Both
Mātarisvan stablish Action. {#40:4}

It moveth; it is motionless. It is far distant; it is near.
It is within This All; and it surrounds This All externally. {#40:5}

The man who in his Self beholds all creatures and all things
that be,
And in all beings sees his Self, thence doubts no longer,
ponders not. {#40:6}

When, in the man who clearly knows, Self hath become all
things that are,[pg 306]
What wilderment, what grief is there in him who sees the
One alone? {#40:7}

He hath attained unto the Bright, Bodiless, Woundless,
Sinewless, the Pure which evil hath not pierced.
Far-sighted, wise, encompassing, he self-existent hath
prescribed aims, as propriety demands, unto the
everlasting Years. {#40:8}

Deep into shade of blinding gloom fall Asambhūti's
worshippers.
They sink to darkness deeper yet who on Sambhūti are
intent. {#40:9}

One fruit, they say, from Sambhava, another from Asambhava.
Thus from the sages have we heard who have declared this
lore to us. {#40:10}

The man who knows Sambhūti and Vināsa simultaneously,
He, by Vināsa passing death, gains by Sambhūti endless life. {#40:11}

[pg 307]

To blinding darkness go the men who make a cult of
Nescience.
The devotees of Science enter darkness that is darker still. {#40:12}

Different is the fruit, they say, of Science and of Nescience.
Thus from the sages have we heard who have declared this
lore to us. {#40:13}

The man who knoweth well these two, Science and Nescience,
combined,
O’ercoming death by Nescience by Science gaineth endless
life. {#40:14}

My breath reach everlasting Air! In ashes let my body end.
OM! Mind, remember thou; remember thou my sphere;
remember thou my deeds. {#40:15}

[pg 308]

By goodly path lead us to riches, Agni, thou God who
knowest all our works and wisdom.
Remove the sin that makes us stray and wander: most
ample adoration will we bring thee. {#40:16}

The Real's face is hidden by a vessel formed of golden light.
The Spirit yonder in the Sun, the Spirit dwelling there am I.
OM! Heaven! Brahma! {#40:17}

[pg 310]
