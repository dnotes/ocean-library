The Universal House of Justice
8 November 2021

To all National Spiritual Assemblies

Dear Bahá’í Friends,

Developments at the Bahá’í World Centre aimed at preserving the precious Holy Places associated with the Central Figures of our Faith continue apace, and we are happy to announce the progress being made at Mazra‘ih, that serene and sacred spot, the first residence of Bahá’u’lláh after nine years’ confinement within the walls of the prison-city of ‘Akká.

The room of Bahá’u’lláh in the Mansion of Mazra‘ih has been restored to reflect more closely its original style—the painted flower designs adorning the walls, which had been plastered over many years ago, have been revived, and the original windows on each wall, through which Bahá’u’lláh Himself looked out over the orchards, hills, and sea, have been reinstated. In the courtyard, the garden and surrounding walls have been made new, and a portion of the aqueduct has now been restored, the very one that was repaired at the suggestion of Bahá’u’lláh in response to an offer of service by the governor of ‘Akká. Other changes have also been made in the approaches to the Mansion and the surrounding farmland.

In the coming years, conservation work will be carried out on the other rooms of the Mansion, and the surrounding area will be landscaped to provide a large, open space for visitors to walk around and enjoy, intending to capture the tranquil spirit of this blessed spot. While construction work remains ongoing, it is our hope that soon pilgrims will be able to visit this Holy Site once again.
