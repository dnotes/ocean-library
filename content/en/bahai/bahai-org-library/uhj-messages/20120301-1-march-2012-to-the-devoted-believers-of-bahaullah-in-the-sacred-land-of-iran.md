\[AUTHORIZED TRANSLATION FROM PERSIAN\]
1 March 2012

To the devoted believers of Bahá’u’lláh in the sacred land of Írán

As we enter the month of the Fast, every hour of which is, according to the Pen of the Most High, endowed with a special virtue, the lovers of the Blessed Beauty throughout the world draw upon the celestial potency latent in these days in order to obtain a fresh measure of spiritual vitality. To observe the Fast with purity of motive attracts divine confirmations and leads to the awakening and cleansing of the heart. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá writes, “Blessed are they who have observed the fast during its appointed month, who have gathered together in perfect unity and harmony, have freed themselves from the insinuations of doubt and stood firm in the Covenant.” He describes “this physical fast” as “a symbol of the spiritual fast”, meaning “the cleansing of the soul from all selfish desires, the acquisition of spiritual attributes, \[and\] attraction to the breezes of the All-Merciful.” Turn therefore in these blessed days to the Threshold of the Ancient Beauty in supplication and prayer. May the community of the Greatest Name in the Cradle of the Faith win new confirmations and victories through your sacrifice and constructive resilience. During these days of fasting so laden with blessings, your spiritual brothers and sisters throughout the world are united with you in spirit and raise their hands in prayer, imploring God for relief and well-being both for you and for the other long-suffering citizens of your country, as well as for the progress and honour of that sacred land. We, too, supplicate at His Threshold and beseech His favours for you, champions in the arena of faithfulness and ardent lovers of the Blessed Beauty, as well as for the noble people of Írán.
