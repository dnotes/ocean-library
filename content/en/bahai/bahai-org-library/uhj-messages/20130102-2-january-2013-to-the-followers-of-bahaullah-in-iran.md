\[AUTHORIZED TRANSLATION FROM PERSIAN\]
2 January 2013

To the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in Írán

Dearly loved Friends,

It is heartening to see that so many of the people of Írán, despite the numerous obstacles to social advancement that confront their country, continue to yearn to build a progressive society in which the nation’s marvellous capabilities can flourish and the prosperity of their countrymen and women can be assured. Countless individuals, in particular the enlightened youth, are ready to devote their energies and their God-given talents to the social and economic development of their homeland. It brings pleasure to our hearts that you, too, despite the persistence of widespread oppression and injustice, strive to play your part in this great undertaking. Success in so significant an enterprise requires cordial and unfettered consultation among the different elements of society that would lead to a deeper appreciation and a keener understanding of the many profound and interrelated concepts pertaining to social and economic development. We have therefore decided to send you the Persian-language translation of a statement issued in 1995 by the Office of Public Information of the Bahá’í International Community titled “The Prosperity of Humankind”, which was sent at that time to all National Spiritual Assemblies. It is hoped that reflection upon the content of this weighty document will assist the Bahá’ís of Írán in their discussion of its themes with other people of goodwill who are concerned about the progress and advancement of that sacred land.

We ardently supplicate in the Holy Shrines that the Blessed Beauty may bestow His unfailing confirmations upon you.
