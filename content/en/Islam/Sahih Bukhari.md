## Volume 1, Book 1

Narrated by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab {#1:1 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:2 .italic}

(the mother of the faithful believers) Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Alláh's Apostle "O Alláh's Apostle! How is the Divine Inspiration revealed to you?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes ' off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says." 'Aisha added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:3 .italic}

(the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Alláh's Apostle was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Alláh alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, "I do not know how to read. The Prophet added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists) has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous." (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Alláh's Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, "I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija replied, "Never! By Alláh, Alláh will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin ‘Abdu’l-'Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Alláh wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" Alláh's Apostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Alláh had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Alláh's Apostle asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while. Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh Al-Ansari while talking about the period of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet "While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira' sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, 'Wrap me (in blankets).' And then Alláh revealed the following Holy Verses (of Qur’án): 'O you (i.e. Muḥammad)! wrapped up in garments!' Arise and warn (the people against Alláh's Punishment),... up to 'and desert the idols.' (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#1:4 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás in the explanation of the Statement of Alláh. 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith." (75.16) Said "Alláh's Apostle used to bear the revelation with great trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration." Ibn ‘Abbás moved his lips saying, "I am moving my lips in front of you as Alláh's Apostle used to move his." Said moved his lips saying: "I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn ‘Abbás moving his." Ibn ‘Abbás added, "So Alláh revealed 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give you (O Muḥammad) the ability to recite it (the Qur’án) (75.16-17) which means that Alláh will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur’án which was revealed at that time by heart and recite it. The Statement of Alláh: And 'When we have recited it to you (O Muḥammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur’án) recital' (75.18) means 'listen to it and be silent.' Then it is for Us (Alláh) to make It clear to you' (75.19) means 'Then it is (for Alláh) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself through your tongue). Afterwards, Alláh's Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#1:5 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was the most generous of all the people, and he used to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramaḍán when Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramaḍán to teach him the Qur’án. Alláh's Apostle was the most generous person, even more generous than the strong uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste to do charitable deeds).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás {#1:6 .italic}

Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Alláh's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, "Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?" Abu Sufyan replied, "I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group)." Heraclius said, "Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him." Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me." Abu Sufyan added, "By Alláh! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was: 'What is his family status amongst you?' I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.' Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?' I replied, 'No.' Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?' I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.' He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?' I replied, 'They are increasing.' He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?' I replied, 'No.' Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?' I replied, 'No. ' Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?' I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that. Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?' I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.' Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He tells us to worship Alláh and Alláh alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.' Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Alláh. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Alláh and Alláh alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Alláh's Apostle which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: "In the name of Alláh the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muḥammad the slave of Alláh and His Apostle to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Alláh will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Alláh's Statement:) 'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Alláh and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Alláh. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to Alláh).' (3:64). Abu Sufyan then added, "When Heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muḥammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Alláh guided me to it)." The sub narrator adds, "Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya' (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya' (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews). 'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.' While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Alláh's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice circumcision.' (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).' (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience. (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).

Not to accuse an innocent person (to spread such an accusation among people). 6. Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good deed."

And whoever indulges in any one of them (except the ascription of partners to Alláh) and gets the punishment in this world, that punishment will be an expiation for that sin.

Did you abuse him by calling his mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of ignorance. Your slaves are your brothers and Alláh has put them under your command.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:38 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in the mornings, the nights." (See Fath-ul-Bari, Page 102, Vol 1).

Narrated by Al-Bara' (bin 'Azib) {#1:39 .italic}

When the Prophet came to Medina, he stayed first with his grandfathers or maternal uncles from Ansar. He offered his prayers facing Baitul-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka'ba (at Mecca). The first prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He said addressing them, "By Alláh, I testify that I have prayed with Alláh's Apostle facing Mecca (Ka'ba).' Hearing that, those people changed their direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during the prayers, they disapproved of it. Al-Bara' added, "Before we changed our direction towards the Ka'ba (Mecca) in prayers, some Muslims had died or had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers.) Alláh then revealed: And Alláh would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. the prayers of those Muslims were valid).' " (2:143).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:40 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "If any one of you improve (follows strictly) his Islamic religion then his good deeds will be rewarded ten times to seven hundred times for each good deed and a bad deed will be recorded as it is."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:41 .italic}

Once the Prophet came while a woman was sitting with me. He said, "Who is she?" I replied, "She is so and so," and told him about her (excessive) praying. He said disapprovingly, "Do (good) deeds which is within your capacity (without being overtaxed) as Alláh does not get tired (of giving rewards) but (surely) you will get tired and the best deed (act of Worship) in the sight of Alláh is that which is done regularly."

And whoever said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and has in his heart good (faith) equal to the weight of an atom will be taken out of Hell."

The Jew replied, "This day I have perfected your religion For you, completed My favor upon you, And have chosen for you Islam as your religion."

A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Alláh's Apostle and we heard his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. Alláh's Apostle said, "You have to offer prayers perfectly five times in a day and night (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more (praying)?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to offer the Nawafil prayers (you can)." Alláh's Apostle further said to him: "You have to observe fasts during the month of Ramad, an." The man asked, "Is there any more fasting?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)" Then Alláh's Apostle further said to him, "You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)." The man asked, "Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to pay?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "No, unless you want to give alms of your own." And then that man retreated saying, "By Alláh! I will neither do less nor more than this." Alláh's Apostle said, "If what he said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted Paradise)."

The Prophet said, "Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (an evil doing) and killing him is Kufr (disbelief)." Narrated 'Ubada bin As-Samit: "Alláh's Apostle went out to inform the people about the (date of the) night of decree (Al-Qadr) but there happened a quarrel between two Muslim men. The Prophet said, "I came out to inform you about (the date of) the night of Al-Qadr, but as so and so and so and so quarrelled, its knowledge was taken away (I forgot it) and maybe it was better for you. Now look for it in the 7th, the 9th and the 5th (of the last 10 nights of the month of Ramaḍán)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:47 .italic}

One day while the Prophet was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, "What is faith?" Alláh's Apostle replied, 'Faith is to believe in Alláh, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection." Then he further asked, "What is Islam?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "To worship Alláh Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramaḍán." Then he further asked, "What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "To worship Alláh as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you." Then he further asked, "When will the Hour be established?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents. 1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master. 2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Alláh. The Prophet then recited: "Verily, with Alláh (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour--." (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion." Abu ‘Abdu’lláh said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith.

I was informed by Abu Sufyan that Heraclius said to him, "I asked you whether they (followers of Muḥammad) were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. And in fact, this is the way of true Faith till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his (the Prophets) religion (Islam) became displeased and discarded it. You replied in the negative, and in fact, this is (a sign of) true faith. When its delight enters the heart and mixes with them completely, nobody can be displeased with it."

Narrated by An-Nu'man bin Bashir {#1:49 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it. (O people!) Beware! Every king has a Hima and the Hima of Alláh on the earth is His illegal (forbidden) things. Beware! There is a piece of flesh in the body if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.

Narrated by Abu Jamra {#1:50 .italic}

I used to sit with Ibn ‘Abbás and he made me sit on his sitting place. He requested me to stay with him in order that he might give me a share from his property. So I stayed with him for two months. Once he told (me) that when the delegation of the tribe of ‘Abdu’l- Qais came to the Prophet, the Prophet asked them, "Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are the delegate?" They replied, "We are from the tribe of Rabi'a." Then the Prophet said to them, "Welcome! O people (or O delegation of ‘Abdu’l- Qais)! Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret." They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We cannot come to you except in the sacred month and there is the infidel tribe of Mudar intervening between you and us. So please order us to do something good (religious deeds) so that we may inform our people whom we have left behind (at home), and that we may enter Paradise (by acting on them)." Then they asked about drinks (what is legal and what is illegal). The Prophet ordered them to do four things and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to believe in Alláh Alone and asked them, "Do you know what is meant by believing in Alláh Alone?" They replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." Thereupon the Prophet said, "It means: 1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and Muḥammad is Alláh's Apostle. 2. To offer prayers perfectly 3. To pay the Zakat (obligatory charity) 4. To observe fast during the month of Ramaḍán. 5. And to pay Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Alláh's Cause). Then he forbade them four things, namely, Hantam, Dubba,' Naqir Ann Muzaffat or Muqaiyar; (These were the names of pots in which Alcoholic drinks were prepared) (The Prophet mentioned the container of wine and he meant the wine itself). The Prophet further said (to them): "Memorize them (these instructions) and convey them to the people whom you have left behind."

Alláh's Apostle said, "The reward of deeds depends upon the intention and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.

And whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."

On the day when Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and thanked and praised Alláh and said, "Be afraid of Alláh alone Who has none along with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet till the (new) chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask Alláh's forgiveness for your (late) chief because he himself loved to forgive others." Jarir added, "Amma badu (now then), I went to the Prophet and said, 'I give my pledge of allegiance to you for Islam." The Prophet conditioned (my pledge) for me to be sincere and true to every Muslim so I gave my pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this mosque! I am sincere and true to you (Muslims). Then Jarir asked for Alláh's forgiveness and came down (from the pulpit).

The Bedouin said, "I am here, O Alláh's Apostle ." Then the Prophet said, "When honesty is lost, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday)." The Bedouin said, "How will that be lost?"

When Alláh's Apostle finished his preaching, he said, "Shall I tell you about these three persons? One of them be-took himself to Alláh, so Alláh took him into His grace and mercy and accommodated him, the second felt shy from Alláh, so Alláh sheltered Him in His mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his face from Alláh and went away, so Alláh turned His face from him likewise.

(And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Alláh's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Alláh has revealed through me (the Prophets and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Alláh's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land.)"

No doubt it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be like the trials of Masiah-ad-Dajjal or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not sure which expression Asmá’ used). You will be asked, 'What do you know about this man (the Prophet Muḥammad)?' Then the faithful believer (or Asmá’ said a similar word) will reply, 'He is Muḥammad Alláh's Apostle who had come to us with clear evidences and guidance and so we accepted his teachings and followed him. And he is Muḥammad.' And he will repeat it thrice. Then the angels will say to him, 'Sleep in peace as we have come to know that you were a faithful believer.'

When I went I used to bring the news of that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. Once my Ansari friend, in his turn (on returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door and asked if I was there." I became horrified and came out to him. He said, "Today a great thing has happened." I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked her, "Did Alláh's Apostle divorce you all?" She replied, "I do not know." Then, I entered upon the Prophet and said while standing, "Have you divorced your wives?" The Prophet replied in the negative. On what I said, "Allahu-Akbar (Alláh is Greater)." (See Ḥadít_h No. 119, Vol. 3 for details)

Narrated by Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari {#1:90 .italic}

Once a man said to Alláh's Apostle "O Alláh's Apostle! I may not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the Imam) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added: "I never saw the Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. The Prophet said, "O people! Some of you make others dislike good deeds (the prayers). So whoever leads the people in prayer should shorten it because among them there are the sick the weak and the needy (having some jobs to do)."

Narrated by Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani {#1:91 .italic}

A man asked the Prophet about the picking up of a "Luqata" (fallen lost thing). The Prophet replied, "Recognize and remember its tying material and its container, and make public announcement (about it) for one year, then utilize it but give it to its owner if he comes." Then the person asked about the lost camel. On that, the Prophet got angry and his cheeks or his Face became red and he said, "You have no concern with it as it has its water container, and its feet and it will reach water, and eat (the leaves) of trees till its owner finds it." The man then asked about the lost sheep. The Prophet replied, "It is either for you, for your brother (another person) or for the wolf."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#1:92 .italic}

The Prophet was asked about things which he did not like, but when the questioners insisted, the Prophet got angry. He then said to the people, "Ask me anything you like." A man asked, "Who is my father?" The Prophet replied, "Your father is Hudhafa." Then another man got up and said, "Who is my father, O Alláh's Apostle ?" He replied, "Your father is Salim, Maula (the freed slave) of Shaiba." So when ‘Umar saw that (the anger) on the face of the Prophet he said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We repent to Alláh (Our offending you)."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#1:93 .italic}

One day Alláh's Apostle came out (before the people) and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Hudhafa stood up and asked (him) "Who is my father?" The Prophet replied, "Your father is Hudhafa." The Prophet told them repeatedly (in anger) to ask him anything they liked. ‘Umar knelt down before the Prophet and said thrice, "We accept Alláh as (our) Lord and Islam as (our) religion and Muḥammad as (our) Prophet." After that the Prophet became silent.

Narrated by Anas {#1:94 .italic}

Whenever the Prophet asked permission to enter, he knocked the door thrice with greeting and whenever he spoke a sentence (said a thing) he used to repeat it thrice. (See Ḥadít_h No. 261, Vol. 8).

Narrated by Anas {#1:95 .italic}

Whenever the Prophet spoke a sentence (said a thing), he used to repeat it thrice so that the people could understand it properly from him and whenever he asked permission to enter, (he knocked the door) thrice with greeting.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#1:96 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle remained behind us in a journey. He joined us while we were performing ablution for the 'Asr prayer which was over-due. We were just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them properly) so the Prophet addressed us in a loud voice and said twice or thrice, "Save your heels from the fire."

Narrated by Abu Burda's father {#1:97 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said "Three persons will have a double reward: 1. A Person from the people of the scriptures who believed in his prophet (Jesus or Moses) and then believed in the Prophet Muḥammad (i .e. has embraced Islam). 2. A slave who discharges his duties to Alláh and his master. 3. A master of a woman-slave who teaches her good manners and educates her in the best possible way (the religion) and manumits her and then marries her."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#1:97 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle came out while Bilal was accompanying him. He went towards the women thinking that they had not heard him (i.e. his sermon). So he preached them and ordered them to pay alms. (Hearing that) the women started giving alms; some donated their ear-rings, some gave their rings and Bilal was collecting them in the corner of his garment.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:98 .italic}

I said: "O Alláh's Apostle! Who will be the luckiest person, who will gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?" Alláh's Apostle said: O Abu Huraira! "I have thought that none will ask me about it before you as I know your longing for the (learning of) Hádíths. The luckiest person who will have my intercession on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who said sincerely from the bottom of his heart "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh." And ‘Umar bin ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz wrote to Abu Bakr bin Hazm, "Look for the knowledge of Ḥadít_h and get it written, as I am afraid that religious knowledge will vanish and the religious learned men will pass away (die). Do not accept anything save the Hádíths of the Prophet. Circulate knowledge and teach the ignorant, for knowledge does not vanish except when it is kept secretly (to oneself)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh Ibn Dinar {#1:99 .italic}

also narrates the same (above-mentioned statement) as has been narrated by ‘Umar bin ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz up to "The religious scholar (learned men) will pass away (die)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr bin Al' As {#1:100 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Alláh does not take away the knowledge, by taking it away from (the hearts of) the people, but takes it away by the death of the religious learned men till when none of the (religious learned men) remains, people will take as their leaders ignorant persons who when consulted will give their verdict without knowledge. So they will go astray and will lead the people astray."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#1:101 .italic}

Some women requested the Prophet to fix a day for them as the men were taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious lessons and commandments. Once during such a lesson the Prophet said, "A woman whose three children die will be shielded by them from the Hell fire." On that a woman asked, "If only two die?" He replied, "Even two (will shield her from the Hell-fire)."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#1:102 .italic}

as above (the sub narrators are different). Abu Huraira qualified the three children referred to in the above mentioned Ḥadít_h as not having reached the age of committing sins (i.e. age of puberty).

Narrated by Ibn Abu Mulaika {#1:103 .italic}

Whenever 'Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything which she did not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it completely. Aisha said: "Once the Prophet said, "Whoever will be called to account (about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will surely be punished." I said, "Doesn't Alláh say: "He surely will receive an easy reckoning." (84.8) The Prophet replied, "This means only the presentation of the accounts but whoever will be argued about his account, will certainly be ruined."

Narrated by Said {#1:104 .italic}

Abu Shuraih said, "When 'Amr bin Said was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair) I said to him, 'O chief! Allow me to tell you what the Prophet said on the day following the conquests of Mecca. My ears heard and my heart comprehended, and I saw him with my own eyes, when he said it. He glorified and praised Alláh and then said, "Alláh and not the people has made Mecca a sanctuary. So anybody who has belief in Alláh and the Last Day (i.e. a Muslim) should neither shed blood in it nor cut down its trees. If anybody argues that fighting is allowed in Mecca as Alláh's Apostle did fight (in Mecca), tell him that Alláh gave permission to His Apostle, but He did not give it to you. The Prophet added: Alláh allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today (now) its sanctity is the same (valid) as it was before. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this information) to those who are absent." Abú- Shuraih was asked, "What did 'Amr reply?" He said 'Amr said, "O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you (in this respect). Mecca does not give protection to one who disobeys (Alláh) or runs after committing murder, or theft (and takes refuge in Mecca).

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#1:105 .italic}

The Prophet said. No doubt your blood, property, the sub-narrator Muḥammad thought that Abu Bakra had also mentioned and your honor (chastity), are sacred to one another as is the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours. It is incumbent on those who are present to inform those who are absent." (Muḥammad the Subnarrator used to say, "Alláh's Apostle told the truth.") The Prophet repeated twice: "No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Alláh's message to you.

Narrated by ‘Alí {#1:106 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Do not tell a lie against me for whoever tells a lie against me (intentionally) then he will surely enter the Hell-fire."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair {#1:107 .italic}

I said to my father, 'I do not hear from you any narration (Ḥadít_h) of Alláh s Apostle as I hear (his narrations) from so and so?" Az-Zubair replied. l was always with him (the Prophet) and I heard him saying "Whoever tells a lie against me (intentionally) then (surely) let him occupy, his seat in Hell-fire.

Narrated by Anas {#1:108 .italic}

The fact which stops me from narrating a great number of Hádíths to you is that the Prophet said: "Whoever tells a lie against me intentionally, then (surely) let him occupy his seat in Hell-fire."

Narrated by Salama {#1:109 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "Whoever (intentionally) ascribes to me what I have not said then (surely) let him occupy his seat in Hell-fire."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:110 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Name yourselves with my name (use my name) but do not name yourselves with my Kunya name (i.e. Abu-l Qasim). And whoever sees me in a dream then surely he has seen me for Satan cannot impersonate me. And whoever tells a lie against me (intentionally), then (surely) let him occupy his seat in Hell-fire."

Narrated by Ash-Sha'bi {#1:111 .italic}

Abu Juhaifa said, "I asked ‘Alí, 'Have you got any book (which has been revealed to the Prophet apart from the Qur’án)?' ‘Alí replied, 'No, except Alláh's Book or the power of understanding which has been bestowed (by Alláh) upon a Muslim or what is (written) in this sheet of paper (with me).' Abu Juhaifa said, "I asked, 'What is (written) in this sheet of paper?' ‘Alí replied, it deals with The Diyya (compensation (blood money) paid by the killer to the relatives of the victim), the ransom for the releasing of the captives from the hands of the enemies, and the law that no Muslim should be killed in Qisas (equality in punishment) for the killing of (a disbeliever).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:112 .italic}

In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza'a killed a man from the tribe of Bani Laith in revenge for a killed person, belonging to them. They informed the Prophet about it. So he rode his Rahila (she-camel for riding) and addressed the people saying, "Alláh held back the killing from Mecca. (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether the Prophet said "elephant or killing," as the Arabic words standing for these words have great similarity in shape), but He (Alláh) let His Apostle and the believers over power the infidels of Mecca. Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary) Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anyone before me nor will it be permitted for anyone after me. It (war) in it was made legal for me for few hours or so on that day. No doubt it is at this moment a sanctuary, it is not allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to uproot its trees or to pick up its Luqatt (fallen things) except by a person who will look for its owner (announce it publicly). And if somebody is killed, then his closest relative has the right to choose one of the two-- the blood money (Diyya) or retaliation having the killer killed. In the meantime a man from Yemen came and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Get that written for me." The Prophet ordered his companions to write that for him. Then a man from Quraish said, "Except Al-Iqhkhir (a type of grass that has good smell) O Alláh's Apostle, as we use it in our houses and graves." The Prophet said, "Except Al-Idhkhiri.e. Al-Idhkhir is allowed to be plucked."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:113 .italic}

There is none among the companions of the Prophet who has narrated more Hádíths than I except 'Abdallah bin Amr (bin Al-'As) who used to write them and I never did the same.

Narrated by 'Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:114 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "When the ailment of the Prophet became worse, he said, 'Bring for me (writing) paper and I will write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.' But ‘Umar said, 'The Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Alláh's Book with us and that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet differed about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet said to them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of me." Ibn ‘Abbás came out saying, "It was most unfortunate (a great disaster) that Alláh's Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise. (Note: It is apparent from this Ḥadít_h that Ibn 'Abbes had witnessed the event and came out saying this statement. The truth is not so, for Ibn ‘Abbás used to say this statement on narrating the Ḥadít_h and he had not witnessed the event personally. See Fath Al-Bari Vol. 1, p.220 footnote.) (See Ḥadít_h No. 228, Vol. 4).

Narrated by Um Salama {#1:115 .italic}

One night Alláh's Apostle got up and said, "Subhan Alláh! How many afflictions have been descended tonight and how many treasures have been disclosed! Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings (his wives) up (for prayers). A well-dressed (soul) in this world may be naked in the Hereafter. "

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#1:116 .italic}

Once the Prophet led us in the 'Isha' prayer during the last days of his life and after finishing it (the prayer) (with Taslim) he said: "Do you realize (the importance of) this night?" Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight will be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#1:117 .italic}

I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna bint Al-Harith (the wife of the Prophet ) while the Prophet was there with her during her night turn. The Prophet offered the 'Isha' prayer (in the mosque), returned home and after having prayed four Rakat, he slept. Later on he got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a similar word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by his left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five Rakat followed by two more Rakat. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:118 .italic}

People say that I have narrated many Hádíths (The Prophet's narrations). Had it not been for two verses in the Qur’án, I would not have narrated a single Ḥadít_h, and the verses are: "Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We have sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful." (2:159-160). And no doubt our Muḥájir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with their property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to Alláh's Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that which they used not to memorize.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:119 .italic}

I said to Alláh's Apostle "I hear many narrations (Hádíths) from you but I forget them." Alláh's Apostle said, "Spread your Riḍá' (garment)." I did accordingly and then he moved his hands as if filling them with something (and emptied them in my Riḍá') and then said, "Take and wrap this sheet over your body." I did it and after that I never forgot any thing.

Narrated by Ibrahim bin Al-Mundhir {#1:120 .italic}

Ibn Abi Fudaik narrated the same as above (Ḥadít_h...119) but added that the Prophet had moved his hands as if filling them with something and then he emptied them in the Riḍá' of Abu Huraira.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:121 .italic}

I have memorized two kinds of knowledge from Alláh's Apostle . I have propagated one of them to you and if I propagated the second, then my pharynx (throat) would be cut (i.e. killed).

Narrated by Jarir {#1:122 .italic}

The Prophet said to me during Hajjat-al-Wida': Let the people keep quiet and listen. Then he said (addressing the people), "Do not (become infidels) revert to disbelief after me by striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another (killing each other)."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#1:123 .italic}

I said to Ibn ‘Abbás, "Nauf-Al-Bakali claims that Moses (the companion of Khadir) was not the Moses of Bani Israel but he was another Moses." Ibn ‘Abbás remarked that the enemy of Alláh (Nauf) was a liar.

Narrated by Ubai bin Ka'b {#1:124 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, "Who is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, "I am the most learned." Alláh admonished Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Alláh). So Alláh inspired to him "At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you." Moses said, "O my Lord! How can I meet him?" Alláh said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha' bin Nuin and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: "Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey." Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, "Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish." Moses remarked, "That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their foot-steps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, "How do people greet each other in your land?" Moses said, "I am Moses." He asked, "The Moses of Bani Israel?" Moses replied in the affirmative and added, "May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught." Al-Khadir replied, "Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Alláh which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Alláh has taught you which I do not know." Moses said, "Alláh willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you in aught. So both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: "O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Alláh's knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak." Al-Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, "These people gave us a free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people." Al-Khadir replied, "Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me." Moses said, "Call me not to account for what I forgot." The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, "Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed none." Al-Kha,dir replied, "Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, "If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it." Al-Khadir replied, "This is the parting between you and me." The Prophet added, "May Alláh be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story with Al-Khadir. "

Narrated by Abu Musa {#1:125 .italic}

A man came to the Prophet and asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What kind of fighting is in Alláh's cause? (I ask this), for some of us fight because of being enraged and angry and some for the sake of his pride and haughtiness." The Prophet raised his head (as the questioner was standing) and said, "He who fights so that Alláh's Word (Islam) should be superior, then he fights in Alláh's cause."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amar {#1:126 .italic}

I saw the Prophet near the Jamra and the people were asking him questions (about religious problems). A man asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have slaughtered the Hádí (animal) before doing the Rami." The Prophet replied, "Do the Rami (now) and there is no harm." Another person asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! I got my head shaved before slaughtering the animal." The Prophet replied, "Do the slaughtering (now) and there is no harm." So on that day, when the Prophet was asked about anything as regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due time his reply was, "Do it (now) and there is no harm."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:127 .italic}

While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of Medina and he was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, "O Aba-l-Qasim ! What is the spirit?" The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while being inspired) was over. The Prophet then said, "And they ask you (O Muḥammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a little)." (17.85)

Narrated by Aswad {#1:128 .italic}

Ibn Az-Zubair said to me, "Aisha used to tell you secretly a number of things. What did she tell you about the Ka'ba?" I replied, "She told me that once the Prophet said, 'O 'Aisha! Had not your people been still close to the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (infidelity)! I would have dismantled the Ka'ba and would have made two doors in it; one for entrance and the other for exit." Later on Ibn Az-Zubair did the same.

"Once Mu'adh was along with Alláh's Apostle as a companion rider. Alláh's Apostle said, "O Mu'adh bin Jabal." Mu'adh replied, "Labbaik and Sa'daik. O Alláh's Apostle!" Again the Prophet said, "O Mu'adh!" Mu'adh said thrice, "Labbaik and Sa'daik, O Alláh's Apostle!" Alláh's Apostle said, "There is none who testifies sincerely that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and Muḥammad is his Apostle, except that Alláh, will save him from the Hell-fire." Mu'adh said, "O Alláh's Apostle ! Should I not inform the people about it so that they may have glad tidings?" He replied, "When the people hear about it, they will solely depend on it." Then Mu'adh narrated the above-mentioned Ḥadít_h just before his death, being afraid of committing sin (by not telling the knowledge).

Narrated by Anas {#1:131 .italic}

I was informed that the Prophet had said to Mu'adh, "Whosoever will meet Alláh without associating anything in worship with Him will go to Paradise." Mu'adh asked the Prophet, "Should I not inform the people of this good news?" The Prophet replied, "No, I am afraid, lest they should depend upon it (absolutely)."

Narrated by Um Salama {#1:132 .italic}

Um-Sulaim came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "Verily, Alláh is not shy of (telling you) the truth. Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge?) The Prophet replied, "Yes, if she notices a discharge." Um Salama, then covered her face and asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Does a woman get a discharge?" He replied, "Yes, let your right hand be in dust (An Arabic expression you say to a person when you contradict his statement meaning "you will not achieve goodness"), and that is why the son resembles his mother."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#1:133 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle said, "Amongst the trees there is a tree, the leaves of which do not fall and is like a Muslim, tell me the name of that tree." Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas and I thought of the date-palm tree but felt shy (to answer). The others asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! inform us of it." He replied, "it is the date-palm tree." I told my father what had come to my mind and on that he said, "Had you said it I would have preferred it to such and such a thing that I might possess."

Narrated by ‘Alí {#1:134 .italic}

I used to get the emotional urethral discharge frequently so I requested Al-Miqdad to ask the Prophet about it. Al-Miqdad asked him and he replied, "One has to perform ablution (after it)." (See Ḥadít_h No. 269).

Narrated by Nafi {#1:135 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said: "A man got up in the mosque and said: O Alláh's Apostle 'At which place you order us that we should assume the Ihram?' Alláh's Apostle replied, 'The residents of Medina should assure the Ihram from Dhil-Hulaifa, the people of Syria from Al-Ju,hfa and the people of Najd from Qarn." Ibn ‘Umar further said, "The people consider that Alláh's Apostle had also said, 'The residents of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.' " Ibn ‘Umar used to say, "I do not: remember whether Alláh's Apostle had said the last statement or not?"

A man asked the Prophet : "What (kinds of clothes) should a Muhrim (a Muslim intending to perform 'Umra or Hajj) wear? He replied, "He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a head cloak or garment scented with saffron or Wars (kinds of perfumes). And if he has n slippers, then he can use Khuffs (leather socks) but the socks should be cut short so as to make the ankles bare." (See Ḥadít_h No. 615, Vol. 2).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:137 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The prayer of a person who does ,Hadath (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs (repeats) the ablution." A person from Hadaramout asked Abu Huraira, "What is 'Hadath'?" Abu Huraira replied, " 'Hadath' means the passing of wind from the anus."

Narrated by Nu'am Al-Mujmir {#1:138 .italic}

Once I went up the roof of the mosque, along with Abu Huraira. He perform ablution and said, "I heard the Prophet saying, "On the Day of Resurrection, my followers will be called "Al-Ghurr-ul-Muhajjalun" from the trace of ablution and whoever can increase the area of his radiance should do so (i.e. by performing ablution regularly).' "

Narrated by ‘Abbás bin Tamim {#1:139 .italic}

My uncle asked Alláh's Apostle about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the prayer. Alláh' Apostle replied: "He should not leave his prayers unless he hears sound or smells something."

Narrated by Kuraib {#1:140 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "The Prophet slept till he snored and then prayed (or probably lay till his breath sounds were heard and then got up and prayed)." Ibn ‘Abbás added: "I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt, Maimuna, the Prophet slept for a part of the night, (See Fateh-al-Bari page 249, Vol. 1), and late in the night, he got up and performed ablution from a hanging water skin, a light (perfect) ablution and stood up for the prayer.

There is no fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection and safety except with You O Alláh!

While I was laying with the Prophet under a single woolen sheet, I got the menses. I slipped away and put on the clothes for menses. He said, "Have you got "Nifas" (menses)?" I replied, "Yes." He then called me and made me lie with him under the same sheet.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:298 .italic}

The Prophet and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in Itikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad {#1:299 .italic}

(on the authority of his father) 'Aisha said: "Whenever Alláh's Apostle wanted to fondle anyone of us during her periods (menses), he used to order her to put on an Izar and start fondling her." 'Aisha added, "None of you could control his sexual desires as the Prophet could."

Narrated by Maimuna {#1:300 .italic}

When ever Alláh's Apostle wanted to fondle any of his wives during the periods (menses), he used to ask her to wear an Izar.

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#1:301 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Alláh's Apostle ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you." The women asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:302 .italic}

We set out with the Prophet for Hajj and when we reached Sarif I got my menses. When the Prophet came to me, I was weeping. He asked, "Why are you weeping?" I said, "I wish if I had not performed Hajj this year." He asked, "May be that you got your menses?" I replied, "Yes." He then said, "This is the thing which Alláh has ordained for all the daughters of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do except that you do not perform the Tawaf round the Ka'ba till you are clean."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:303 .italic}

Fatima bint Abi Hubaish said to Alláh's Apostle, "O Alláh's Apostle! I do not become clean (from bleeding). Shall I give up my prayers?" Alláh's Apostle replied: "No, because it is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (take a bath) and offer your prayers."

Narrated by Asmá’ bint Abi Bakr {#1:304 .italic}

A woman asked Alláh's Apostle, "O Alláh's Apostle! What should we do, if the blood of menses falls on our clothes?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "If the blood of menses falls on the garment of anyone of you, she must take hold of the blood spot, rub it, and wash it with water and then pray in (with it)."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:305 .italic}

Whenever anyone of us got her menses, she, on becoming clean, used to take hold of the blood spot and rub the blood off her garment, and pour water over it and wash that portion thoroughly and sprinkle water over the rest of the garment. After that she would pray in (with) it.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:306 .italic}

Once one of the wives of the Prophet did Itikaf along with him and she was getting bleeding in between her periods. She used to see the blood (from her private parts) and she would perhaps put a dish under her for the blood. (The sub-narrator 'Ikrima added, 'Aisha once saw the liquid of safflower and said, "It looks like what so and so used to have.")

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:307 .italic}

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:309 .italic}

None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

Narrated by Um-'Atiya {#1:310 .italic}

We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days except in the case of a husband for whom mourning was allowed for four months and ten days. (During that time) we were not allowed to put ko,hl (Antimony eye power) in our eyes or to use perfumes or to put on colored clothes except a dress made of 'Asb (a kind of Yemen cloth, very coarse and rough). We were allowed very light perfumes at the time of taking a bath after menses and also we were forbidden to go with the funeral procession.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:311 .italic}

A woman asked the Prophet about the bath which is take after finishing from the menses. The Prophet told her what to do and said, "Purify yourself with a piece of cloth scented with musk." The woman asked, "How shall I purify myself with it" He said, "Subhan Alláh! Purify yourself (with it)." I pulled her to myself and said, "Rub the place soiled with blood with it."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:312 .italic}

An Ansari woman asked the Prophet how to take a bath after finishing from the menses. He replied, "Take a piece a cloth perfumed with musk and clean the private parts with it thrice." The Prophet felt shy and turned his face. So pulled her to me and told her what the Prophet meant.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:313 .italic}

In the last Hajj of Alláh's Apostle I assume the Ihram for Hajj along with Alláh Apostle. I was one of those who intended Tamattu' (to perform Hajj an 'Umra) and did not take the Hádí (animal for sacrifice) with me. I got my menses and was not clean till the night of 'Arafa I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! It is the night of the day of 'Arafat and I intended to perform the Hajj Tamattu' with 'Umra Alláh's Apostle told me to undo my hair and comb it and to postpone the 'Umra. I did the same and completed the Hajj. On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go after finishing all the ceremonies Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet ordered 'Abdur Rahman ('Aisha's brother) to take me to At-Tan'im to assume the lhram for'Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-atTamattu' which I had intended to perform.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:314 .italic}

On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing Hajj. Alláh's Apostle said, "Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for 'Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hádí with me, I would have assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. "Some of us assumed the Ihram for 'Umra while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating until the day of 'Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He told me to postpone my 'Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to At-Tah'im, where I assumed the Ihram for'Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, "For that ('Umra) no Hádí, fasting or alms were required.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#1:315 .italic}

The Prophet said, "At every womb Alláh appoints an angel who says, 'O Lord! A drop of semen, O Lord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of flesh." Then if Alláh wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks, (O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed, and how much will his provision be? And what will his age be?' So all that is written while the child is still in the mother's womb."

Narrated by 'Urwa {#1:316 .italic}

'Aisha said, "We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj. Some of us intended to perform 'Umra while others Hajj. When we reached Mecca, Alláh's Apostle said, 'Those who had assumed the lhram for'Umra and had not brought the Hádí should finish his lhram and whoever had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra and brought the Hádí should not finish the Ihram till he has slaughtered his Hádí and whoever had assumed the lhram for Hajj should complete his Hajj." 'Aisha further said, "I got my periods (menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of 'Arafat, and I had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra only (Tamattu'). The Prophet ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume the lhram for Hajj only and leave the 'Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet sent 'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform 'Umra from At-Tan'im in lieu of the missed 'Umra."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:317 .italic}

Fatima bint Abi Hubaish used to have bleeding in between the periods, so she asked the Prophet about it . He replied, "The bleeding is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So give up the prayers when the (real) menses begin and when it has finished, take a bath and start praying."

Hafsa said, 'We used to forbid our young women to go out for the two 'Id prayers. A woman came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and she narrated about her sister whose husband took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and her sister was with her husband in six (out of these twelve). She (the woman's sister) said, "We used to treat the wounded, look after the patients and once I asked the Prophet, 'Is there any harm for any of us to stay at home if she doesn't have a veil?' He said, 'She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gathering of the Muslims.' When Um 'Atiya came I asked her whether she had heard it from the Prophet. She replied, "Yes. May my father be sacrificed for him (the Prophet)! (Whenever she mentioned the Prophet she used to say, 'May my father be sacrificed for him) I have heard the Prophet saying, 'The unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stay screened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).' " Hafsa asked Um 'Atiya surprisingly, "Do you say the menstruating women?" She replied, "Doesn't a menstruating woman attend 'Arafat (Hajj) and such and such (other deeds)?"

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:322 .italic}

Fatima bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet, "I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers?" He replied, "No, this is from a blood vessel.

## Volume 1, Book 7

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:330 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Alláhs Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida' or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). Alláh's Apostle stayed there to search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that place, so the people went to Abú- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, "Don't you see what 'Aisha has done? She has made Alláh's Apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them." Abu Bakr came while Alláh's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh, He said, to me: "You have detained Alláh's Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water with them. So he admonished me and said what Alláh wished him to say and hit me on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Alláh's Apostle on my thigh. Alláh's Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Alláh revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, "O the family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessing of yours." Then the camel on which I was riding was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath it.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:331 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me. 1. Alláh made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month's journey. 2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due. 3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful for anyone else before me. 4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection). 5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been sent to all mankind.

Narrated by 'Urwa's father {#1:332 .italic}

Aisha said, "I borrowed a necklace from Asmá’ and it was lost. So Alláh's Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed (without ablution) and informed Alláh's Apostle about it, so the verse of Tayammum was revealed." Usaid bin Hudair said to 'Aisha, "May Alláh reward you. By Alláh, whenever anything happened which you did not like, Alláh brought good for you and for the Muslims in that." Al-Jurf and the time for the 'Asr prayer became due while he was at Marbad-AnNa'am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did not repeat that prayer.

Narrated by Abu Juhaim Al-Ansari {#1:333 .italic}

The Prophet came from the direction of Bir Jamál. A man met him and greeted him. But he did not return back the greeting till he went to a (mud) wall and smeared his hands and his face with its dust (performed Tayammum) and then returned back the greeting.

Narrated by 'Abdur Rahman bin Abza {#1:334 .italic}

A man came to ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab and said, "I became Junub but no water was available." 'Ammar bin Yasir said to ‘Umar, "Do you remember that you and I (became Junub while both of us) were together on a journey and you didn't pray but I rolled myself on the ground and prayed? I informed the Prophet about it and he said, 'It would have been sufficient for you to do like this.' The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands."

Narrated by Said bin 'Abdur Rahman bin Abza {#1:335 .italic}

(on the authority of his father who said) 'Ammar said so (the above Statement). And Shu'ba stroked lightly the earth with his hands and brought them close to his mouth (blew off the dust) and passed them over his face and then the backs of his hands. 'Ammar said, "Ablution (meaning Tayammum here) is sufficient for a Muslim if water is not available."

Narrated by 'Abdur Rahman bin Abza {#1:336 .italic}

Narrated by 'Ammar {#1:339 .italic}

The Prophet stroked the earth with his hands and then passed them over his face and the backs of his hands (while demonstrating Tayammum).

Narrated by 'Imran {#1:340 .italic}

Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator 'Auf said that Abu Raja' had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, ‘Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, "Allahu Akbar" and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, "There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, "O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?" He replied, "I am Junub and there is no water. " The Prophet said, "Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you." Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator 'Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and ‘Alí, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, "Where can we find water?" She replied, "I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me." They requested her to accompany them. She asked, "Where?" They said, "To Alláh's Apostle ." She said, "Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?" They replied, "Yes, the same person. So come along." They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, "Help her to dismount." The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Alláh, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Alláh's Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, "We have not taken your water but Alláh has given water to us." She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: "O so and so what has delayed you?" She said, "A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi' and he did such and such a thing. By Alláh, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Alláh's true Apostle." Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, "I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?" They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam. Abu 'Abdultah said: The word Saba'a means "The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion." Abu’l-'Ailya said, "The Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms."

Narrated by Abu Wail {#1:341 .italic}

Abu Muisa said to'‘Abdu’lláh bin Mas'ud, "If one does not find water (for ablution) can he give up the prayer?" ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "If you give the permission to perform Tayammum they will perform Tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it cold." Abu Musa said, "What about the statement of 'Ammar to ‘Umar?" ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "‘Umar was not satisfied by his statement."

Narrated by Shaqiq bin Salama {#1:342 .italic}

I was with ‘Abdu’lláh and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, "O Abu AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water is available?" ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "Do not pray till water is found." Abu Musa said, "What do you say about the statement of 'Ammar (who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said to him: "Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient." ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "Don't you see that ‘Umar was not satisfied by 'Ammar's statement?" Abú- Musa said, "All right, leave 'Ammalr's statement, but what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?" 'Abqiullah kept quiet and then said, "If we allowed it, then they would probably perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold." The narrator added, "I said to Shaqrq, "Then did ‘Abdu’lláh dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?" He replied, "Yes."

Narrated by Al-A'mash {#1:343 .italic}

Shaqiq said, "While I was sitting with ‘Abdu’lláh and Abu Musa Al-Ash-'ari, the latter asked the former, 'If a person becomes Junub and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and offer his prayer?' (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, 'What do you say about this verse from Surat "Al-Ma'ida": When you do not find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? ‘Abdu’lláh replied, 'If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean earth even if water were available but cold.' I said to Shaqiq, 'You then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?' Shaqiq said,'Yes.' (Shaqiq added), "Abu Musa said, 'Haven't you heard the statement of 'Ammar to ‘Umar? He said: I was sent out by Alláh's Apostle for some job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the Prophet of that he said, 'Like this would have been sufficient.' The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.' So ‘Abdu’lláh said to Abú- Musa, 'Don't you know that ‘Umar was not satisfied with 'Ammar's statement?' " Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with ‘Abdu’lláh and Abu Musa, the latter said to the former, "Haven't you heard the statement of 'Ammar to ‘Umar? He said, "Alláh's Apostle sent you and me out and I became Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When we came to Alláh's Apostle I told him about it and he said, 'This would have been sufficient,' passing his hands over his face and the backs of his hands once only.' "

Narrated by 'Imran bin Ḥusayn Al-Khuza'i {#1:344 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle saw a person sitting aloof and not praying with the people. He asked him, "O so and so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people?" He replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! I am Junub and there is no water." The Prophet said, "Perform Tayammum with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you."

## Volume 1, Book 8

Narrated by Abu Dhar {#1:345 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muḥammad I is with me.' He asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left he weeps.' Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said and he opened the gate. Anas said: "Abu Dhar added that the Prophet met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he (the Prophet ) met Adarn on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, "When Gabriel along with the Prophet passed by Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' The Prophet asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Idris." The Prophet added, "I passed by Moses and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Moses.' Then I passed by Jesus and he said, 'Welcome! O pious brother and pious Prophet.' I asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Jesus. Then I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Abraham. The Prophet added, 'Then Gabriel ascended with me to a place where I heard the creaking of the pens." Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet said, "Then Alláh enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Alláh, I passed by Moses who asked me, 'What has Alláh enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Alláh and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to half.

I wish you would come to my house and pray in it so that I could take that place as a Musalla. Alláh's Apostle said. "Alláh willing, I will do so." Next day after the sun rose high, Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr came and Alláh's Apostle asked for permission to enter. I gave him permission and he did not sit on entering the house but said to me, "Where do you like me to pray?" I pointed to a place in my house.

Many members of our family gathered in the house and one of them said, "Where is Malik bin Al-Dukhaishin or Ibn Al-Dukhshun?" One of them replied, "He is a hypocrite and does not love Alláh and His Apostle." Hearing that, Alláh's Apostle said, "Do not say so. Haven't you seen that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh' for Alláh's sake only?" He said, "Alláh and His Apostle know better. We have seen him helping and advising hypocrites." Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh has forbidden the (Hell) fire for those who say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh' for Alláh's sake only."

The Prophet loved to pray wherever the time for the prayer was due even at sheep-folds. Later on he ordered that a mosque should be built and sent for some people of Banu-An-Najjar and said, "O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this (walled) piece of land of yours." They replied, "No! By Alláh! We do not demand its price except from Alláh." Anas added: There were graves of pagans in it and some of it was unleveled and there were some date-palm trees in it. The Prophet ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug out and the unleveled land be level led and the date-palm trees be cut down . (So all that was done). They aligned these cut date-palm trees towards the Qibla of the mosque (as a wall) and they also built two stone side-walls (of the mosque). His companions brought the stones while reciting some poetic verses. The Prophet was with them and he kept on saying, "There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, O Alláh! So please forgive the Ansars and the emigrants. "

The people who were in haste left the mosque through its gates. They wondered whether the prayer was reduced. And amongst them were Abu Bakr and ‘Umar but they hesitated to ask the Prophet.

The Prophet replied, 'I have neither forgotten nor has the prayer been reduced' The Prophet added, 'Is what Dhul Yadain has said true?' They (the people) said, 'Yes, it is true.'

Narrated by 'Amr bin Maimuin {#1:499 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin Mas'ud said, "While Alláh's Apostle was praying beside the Ka'ba, there were some Quraish people sitting in a gathering.

Who amongst you can go and bring the dung, blood and the abdominal contents (intestines, etc). of the slaughtered camels of the family of so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between his shoulders?' The most unfortunate amongst them ('Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait) went (and brought them) and when Alláh's Apostle prostrated, he put them between his shoulders. The Prophet remained in prostration and they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A passerby went to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and the Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon the Quraish on their faces. When Alláh's Apostle completed his prayer, he said, 'O Alláh! Take revenge on Quraish.' He said so thrice and added, 'O Alláh! take revenge on 'Amr bin Hisham, 'Utba bin Rabia, Shaiba bin Rabi'a, Al-Walid bin'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait and ‘Umar a bin Al-Walid." ‘Abdu’lláh added, "By Alláh! I saw all of them dead in the battle field on the day of Badr and they were dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well) at Badr: Alláh's Apostle then said, 'Alláh's curse has descended upon the people of the Qalib (well).

The Prophet said, " I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The first four are as follows): 1. To believe in Alláh.

I said, 'The afflictions caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is good) and forbidding (what is evil).' ‘Umar said, 'I did not mean that but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I (Hudhaifa) said, 'O leader of the faithful believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.' ‘Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'It will be broken.' ‘Umar said, 'Then it will never be closed again.' I was asked whether ‘Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated a Ḥadít_h that was free from any mis-statement" The subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the door). Hudhaifa said, "The door was ‘Umar himself."

The Prophet repeatedly said, "Ask me." Then ‘Umar knelt before him and said, "We are pleased with Alláh as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muḥammad as our Prophet."

Ibn ‘Umar did not find any harm in praying it earlier or in delaying it unless he was afraid that sleep might overwhelm him and he might miss the prayer, and sometimes he used to sleep before the 'Isha' prayer. Ibn Juraij said, "I said to 'Ata', 'I heard Ibn ‘Abbás saying: Once Alláh's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer to such an extent that the people slept and got up and slept again and got up again. Then ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab I, stood up and reminded the Prophet I of the prayer.' 'Ata' said, 'Ibn ‘Abbás said: The Prophet came out as if I was looking at him at this time, and water was trickling from his head and he was putting his hand on his head and then said, 'Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers, I would have ordered them to pray ('Isha' prayer) at this time.' I asked 'Ata' for further information, how the Prophet had kept his hand on his head as he was told by Ibn ‘Abbás. 'Ata' separated his fingers slightly and put their tips on the side of the head, brought the fingers downwards approximating them till the thumb touched the lobe of the ear at the side of the temple and the beard on the face. He neither slowed nor hurried in this action but he acted like that. The Prophet said: "Hadn't I thought it hard for my followers I would have ordered them to pray at this time."

Narrated by Anas {#1:546 .italic}

The Prophet delayed the'lsha' prayer till midnight and then he offered the prayer and said, "The people prayed and slept but you have been in prayer as long as you have been waiting for it (the prayer)." Anas added: As if I am looking now at the glitter of the ring of the Prophet on that night.

We were with the Prophet on a full moon night. He looked at the moon and said, "You will certainly see your Lord as you see this moon, and there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoid missing (through sleep, business, etc.) a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr) and before its setting ('Asr) you must do so. He (the Prophet ) then recited the following verse: And celebrate the praises Of Your Lord before The rising of the sun And before (its) setting." (50.39)

By Alláh, Who took away the Prophet.

So all slept and Bilal rested his back against his Rahila and he too was overwhelmed (by sleep) and slept. The Prophet got up when the edge of the sun had risen and said, 'O Bilal! What about your statement?' He replied, 'I have never slept such a sleep.' The Prophet said, 'Alláh captured your souls when He wished, and released them when He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan for the prayer.' The Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came up and became bright, he stood up and prayed."

(The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to pray the 'Isha' late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 'Ayat' (verses) of the Qur’án in it."

Narrated by Qurra bin Khalid {#1:574 .italic}

Once he waited for Al-Ḥasan and he did not show up till it was about the usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and apologized saying, "Our neighbors invited us."

Nobody present on the surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night." The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Alláh's Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, "Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night"; he meant "When that century (people of that century) would pass away."

Narrated by Abu 'Uthman {#1:576 .italic}

'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, "The Suffa Companions were poor people and the Prophet said, 'Whoever has food for two persons should take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food for four persons he should take one or two from them' Abu Bakr took three men and the Prophet took ten of them." 'Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether 'Abdur Rahman also said, 'My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr's house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the 'Isha' prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr's wife said, 'What detained you from your guests (or guest)?' He said, 'Have you not served them yet?' She said, 'They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused." 'Abdur Rahman added, "I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, 'O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!' and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), 'Eat. No welcome for you.' Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Alláh, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving. Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) 'O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?' She said, 'O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.' Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, 'That (oath) was from Satan' meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet's companions) each being headed by a man. Alláh knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal."

## Volume 1, Book 11

Narrated by Anas {#1:577 .italic}

The people mentioned the fire and the bell (they suggested those as signals to indicate the starting of prayers), and by that they mentioned the Jews and the Christians. Then Bilal was ordered to pronounce Adhan for the prayer by saying its wordings twice, and for the Iqama (the call for the actual standing for the prayers in rows) by saying its wordings once. (Iqama is pronounced when the people are ready for the prayer).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#1:578 .italic}

When the Muslims arrived at Medina, they used to assemble for the prayer, and used to guess the time for it. During those days, the practice of Adhan for the prayers had not been introduced yet. Once they discussed this problem regarding the call for prayer. Some people suggested the use of a bell like the Christians, others proposed a trumpet like the horn used by the Jews, but ‘Umar was the first to suggest that a man should call (the people) for the prayer; so Alláh's Apostle ordered Bilal to get up and pronounce the Adhan for prayers.

Narrated by Anas {#1:579 .italic}

Bilal was ordered to repeat the wording of the Adhan for prayers twice, and to pronounce the wording of the Iqamas once except "Qad-qamat-is-Salat".

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#1:580 .italic}

When the number of Muslims increased they discussed the question as to how to know the time for the prayer by some familiar means. Some suggested that a fire be lit (at the time of the prayer) and others put forward the proposal to ring the bell. Bilal was ordered to pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of the Iqama once only.

Narrated by Abu Qilaba {#1:581 .italic}

Anas said, "Bilal was ordered to pronounce the wording of Adhan twice and of Iqama once only." The sub narrator Isma'li said, "I mentioned that to Aiyub and he added (to that), "Except Iqama (i.e. Qad-Qamatis-Salat which should be said twice)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:582 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When the Adhan is pronounced Satan takes to his heels and passes wind with noise during his flight in order not to hear the Adhan. When the Adhan is completed he comes back and again takes to his heels when the Iqama is pronounced and after its completion he returns again till he whispers into the heart of the person (to divert his attention from his prayer) and makes him remember things which he does not recall to his mind before the prayer and that causes him to forget how much he has prayed."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l- Rahman {#1:583 .italic}

Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri told my father, "I see you liking sheep and the wilderness. So whenever you are with your sheep or in the wilderness and you want to pronounce Adhan for the prayer raise your voice in doing so, for whoever hears the Adhan, whether a human being, a jinn or any other creature, will be a witness for you on the Day of Resurrection." Abu Said added, "I heard it (this narration) from Alláh's Apostle."

Narrated by Humaid {#1:584 .italic}

Anas bin Malik said, "Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight (in Alláh's cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack them." Anas added, "We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the Prophet. The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and when they saw the Prophet they shouted 'Muḥammad! By Alláh, Muḥammad and his army.' When Alláh's Apostle saw them, he said, "Allahu-Akbar! Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#1:585 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whenever you hear the Adhan, say what the Mu'adhdhin is saying.

Narrated by Yaḥyá as above (586) and added {#1:587 .italic}

"Some of my companions told me that Hisham had said, "When the Mu'adhdhin said, "Haiya alas-sala(t) (come for the prayer)." Muawiya said, "La hawla wala quwata illa billah (There is neither might nor any power except with Alláh)" and added, "We heard your Prophet saying the same."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:588 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever after listening to the Adhan says, 'Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-d-da' watit-tammati was-salatil qa'imati, ati Muḥammadan al-wasilata wal-fadilata, wab' athhu maqaman mahmudan-il-ladhi wa' adtahu (O Alláh! Lord of this perfect call (of not ascribing partners to You) and of the regular prayer which is going to be established! Kindly give Muḥammad the right of intercession and superiority and send him (on the Day of Judgment) to the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised him)', then intercession for me will be permitted for him on the Day of Resurrection").

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:589 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "If the people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and for standing in the first row (in congregational prayers) and found no other way to get that except by drawing lots they would draw lots, and if they knew the reward of the Zuhr prayer (in the early moments of its stated time) they would race for it (go early) and if they knew the reward of 'Isha' and Fajr (morning) prayers in congregation, they would come to offer them even if they had to crawl."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Al-Harith {#1:590 .italic}

Once on a rainy muddy day, Ibn ‘Abbás delivered a sermon in our presence and when the Mu'adhdhin pronounced the Adhan and said, "Haiya ala-s-sala(t) (come for the prayer)" Ibn ‘Abbás ordered him to say 'Pray at your homes.' The people began to look at each other (surprisingly). Ibn ‘Abbás said. "It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet or his Mu'adhdhin), and it is a license.'

Narrated by Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:591 .italic}

My father said that Alláh s Apostle said, "Bilal pronounces 'Adhan at night, so keep on eating and drinking (Suhur) till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces Adhan." Salim added, "He was a blind man who would not pronounce the Adhan unless he was told that the day had dawned."

Narrated by Hafsa {#1:592 .italic}

When the Muadh-dhin pronounced the Adhan for Fajr prayer and the dawn became evident the Prophet ordered a two Rakat light prayer (Sunna) before the Iqama of the compulsory (congregational) prayer.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#1:594 .italic}

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Mas'ud {#1:595 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night, so that the one offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might hurry up and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not mean that dawn or morning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered them (towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas'ud imitated the gesture of the Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These gestures illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is not the real dawn) .

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:596 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Bilal pronounces the Adhan at night, so eat and drink (Suhur) till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces the Adhan."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Mughaffal Al-Muzani {#1:597 .italic}

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#1:598 .italic}

"When the Mu'adhdhin pronounced the Adhan, some of the companions of the Prophet would proceed to the pillars of the mosque (for the prayer) till the Prophet arrived and in this way they used to pray two Rakat before the Maghrib prayer. There used to be a little time between the Adhan and the Iqama." Shu'ba said, "There used to be a very short interval between the two (Adhan and Iqama)."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:599 .italic}

Narrated by Malik bin Huwairth {#1:601 .italic}

I came to the Prophet with some men from my tribe and stayed with him for twenty nights. He was kind and merciful to us. When he realized our longing for our families, he said to us, "Go back and stay with your families and teach them the religion, and offer the prayer and one of you should pronounce the Adhan for the prayer when its time is due and the oldest one amongst you should lead the prayer."

Narrated by Abu Dhar {#1:602 .italic}

We were in the company of the Prophet on a journey and the Mu'adhdhin wanted to pronounce the Adhan for the (Zuhr) prayer. The Prophet said to him, "Let it become cooler."

Then he asked us to go back to our families and stay with them and teach them (the religion) and to order them to do good things. He also mentioned some other things which I have (remembered or) forgotten. The Prophet then added, "Pray as you have seen me praying and when it is the time for the prayer one of you should pronounce the Adhan and the oldest of you should lead the prayer.

Alláh's Apostle went out (of the mosque) when the Iqama had been pronounced and the rows straightened. The Prophet stood at his Musalla (praying place) and we waited for the Prophet to begin the prayer with Takbir. He left and asked us to remain in our places. We kept on standing till the Prophet returned and the water was trickling from his head for he had taken a bath (of Janaba).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:613 .italic}

Once iqama was pronounced and the people had straightened the rows, Alláh's Apostle went forward (to lead the prayer) but he was Junub, so he said, "Remain in your places." And he went out, took a bath and returned with water trickling from his head. Then he led the prayer.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:614 .italic}

On the day of Al-Khandaq (the trench), ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab went to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle!

Once Iqama was pronounced a man came to the Prophet and detained him (from the prayer).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:617 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is I was about to order for collecting fire-wood (fuel) and then order Someone to pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and then order someone to lead the prayer then I would go from behind and burn the houses of men who did not present themselves for the (compulsory congregational) prayer. By Him, in Whose Hands my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he would get a bone covered with good meat or two (small) pieces of meat present in between two ribs, he would have turned up for the 'Isha' prayer.'

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#1:618 .italic}

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#1:619 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The prayer in congregation is twenty five times superior to the prayer offered by person alone."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:620 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The reward of the prayer offered by a person in congregation is twenty five times greater than that of the prayer offered in one's house or in the market (alone). And this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of praying, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and his one sin is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers his prayer, the angels keep on asking Alláh's Blessings and Alláh's forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musalla. They say, 'O Alláh!

(The Prophet further said, "If the people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and for standing in the first row (in the congregational prayer) and found no other way to get it except by drawing lots they would do so, and if they knew the reward of offering the Zuhr prayer early (in its stated time), they would race for it and they knew the reward for 'Isha' and Fajr prayers in congregation, they would attend them even if they were to crawl')

He gave the order for the third time and said, 'You (women) are the companions of Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the prayer.' So Abu Bakr came out to lead the prayer. In the meantime the condition of the Prophet improved a bit and he came out with the help of two men one on each side. As if I was observing his legs dragging on the ground owing to the disease. Abu Bakr wanted to retreat but the Prophet beckoned him to remain at his place and the Prophet was brought till he sat beside Abu Bakr." Al-A'mash was asked, "Was the Prophet praying and Abu Bakr following him, and were the people following Abu Bakr in that prayer?" Al-A'mash replied in the affirmative with a nod of his head.

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "It seems that you thought ill of it but no doubt it was done by one who was better than I (i.e. the Prophet). It (the prayer) is a strict order and I disliked to bring you out."

The people clapped their hands. Abu Bakr never glanced sideways in his prayer but when the people continued clapping, Abu Bakr looked and saw Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle beckoned him to stay at his place. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Alláh for that order of Alláh's Apostle and then he retreated till he reached the first row.

In the meantime Alláh's Apostle felt better and came out with the help of two persons and both of his legs were dragging on the ground till he entered the mosque. When Abu Bakr heard him coming, he tried to retreat but Alláh's Apostle beckoned him to carry on. The Prophet sat on his left side. Abu Bakr was praying while standing and Alláh's Apostle was leading the prayer while sitting. Abu Bakr was following the Prophet and the people were following Abu Bakr (in the prayer).

Once Alláh's Apostle prayed two Rakat (instead of four) and finished his prayer. Dhu-l-yadain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced or whether he had forgotten.

Then Alláh's Apostle stood up, offered the remaining two Rakat and then finished his prayer with Taslim and then said, "Allahu Akbar." He followed it with two prostrations like ordinary prostrations or a bit longer.

He said, "Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." I said to Hafsa, "Say to him, 'Abu Bakr is a softhearted man and if he stood in your place he would not be able to make the people hear him owing to his weeping. So order ‘Umar to lead the people in the prayer.' " Hafsa did so but Alláh's Apostle said, "Keep quiet. Verily you are the companions of (Prophet) Joseph. Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer." Hafsa said to me, "I never got any good from you."

All the people praised him till they came to the mosque of the tribe of Bani 'Abs; one of the men called Usama bin Qatada with a surname of Aba Sa'da stood up and said, "As you have put us under an oath; I am bound to tell you that Sa'd never went himself with the army and never distributed (the war booty) equally and never did justice in legal verdicts." (On hearing it) Sa'd said, "I pray to Alláh for three things: O Alláh! If this slave of yours is a liar and got up for showing off, give him a long life, increase his poverty and put him to trials." (And so it happened).

Fire commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who asked them, "What is wrong with you?" They said, "A barrier has been placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us." They said, "The thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven."

He used to say Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from prostration; again he would Say Takbir on prostrating and raising his head. He would then do the same in the whole of the prayer till it was completed. On rising from the second Rak'a (after sitting for At-Tahiyyat), he used to say Takbir.

Narrated by Mus'ab bin Sa'd {#1:756 .italic}

I offered prayer beside my father and approximated both my hands and placed them in between the knees. My father told me not to do so and said, "We used to do the same but we were forbidden (by the Prophet) to do it and were ordered to place the hands on the knees."

Narrated by Zaid binWahb {#1:757 .italic}

Hudhaifa saw a person who was not performing the bowing and prostrations perfectly. He said to him, "You have not prayed and if you should die you would die on a religion other than that of Muḥammad."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#1:758 .italic}

The bowing, the prostration the sitting in between the two prostrations and the standing after the bowing of the Prophet but not Qiyam (standing in the prayer) and Qu'ud (sitting in the prayer) used to be approximately equal (in duration).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:759 .italic}

Once the Prophet entered the mosque, a man came in, offered the prayer and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet returned his greeting and said to him, "Go back and pray again for you have not prayed." The man offered the prayer again, came back and greeted the Prophet. He said to him thrice, "Go back and pray again for you have not prayed." The man said, "By Him Who has sent you with the truth! I do not know a better way of praying. Kindly teach Me how to pray." He said, "When you stand for the prayer, say Takbir and then recite from the Qur’án what you know and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease, then rise from bowing till you stand straight. Afterwards prostrate calmly till you feel at ease and then raise (your head) and sit with Calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness till you feel at ease in prostration and do the same in the whole of your prayer."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:760 .italic}

The Prophet used to say in his bowing and prostrations, "Subhanaka-Allahumma Rabbana wa-bihamdika Allahumma-ighfirli.' (I honor Alláh from all what (unsuitable things) is ascribed to Him. O Alláh Our Lord! And all the praises are for You. O Alláh! Forgive me)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:761 .italic}

When the Prophet said, "Sami' a-l-lahu Liman hamida," (Alláh heard those who sent praises to Him), he would say, "Rabbana wa-laka-l-hamd." On bowing and raising his head from it the Prophet used to say Takbir. He also used to say Takbir on rising after the two prostrations. (See Ḥadít_h No. 656).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:762 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When the Imam says, "Sami' a-l-lahu Liman hamida," you should say, "Allahumma Rabbana laka-l-hamd." And if the saying of any one of you coincides with that of the angels, all his past sins will be forgiven."

Narrated by Anas {#1:763 .italic}

The Qunut used to be recited in the Maghrib and the Fajr prayers.

Narrated by Rifa'a bin Rafi AzZuraqi {#1:764 .italic}

One day we were praying behind the Prophet. When he raised his head from bowing, he said, "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida." A man behind him said, "Rabbana walaka-l hamd hamdan Kathiran taiyiban mubarakan fihi" (O our Lord! All the praises are for You, many good and blessed praises). When the Prophet completed the prayer, he asked, "Who has said these words?" The man replied, "I." The Prophet said, "I saw over thirty angels competing to write it first." Prophet rose (from bowing) and stood straight till all the vertebrae of his spinal column came to a natural position.

Narrated by Thabit {#1:765 .italic}

Anas used to demonstrate to us the prayer of the Prophet and while demonstrating, he used to raise his head from bowing and stand so long that we would say that he had forgotten (the prostration).

Narrated by Al-Bara' {#1:766 .italic}

The bowing, the prostrations, the period of standing after bowing and the interval between the two prostrations of the Prophet used to be equal in duration.

Narrated by Aiyub {#1:767 .italic}

Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith used to demonstrate to us the prayer of the Prophet at times other than that of the compulsory prayers. So (once) he stood up for prayer and performed a perfect Qiyam (standing and reciting from the Holy Qur’án) and then bowed and performed bowing perfectly; then he raised his head and stood straight for a while." Abu Qilaba added, "Malik bin Huwairith in that demonstration prayed like this S_hayk_h of ours, Abu Yazíd." Abu, Yazíd used to sit (for a while) on raising his head from the second prostration before getting up.

Narrated by Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur Rahman Ibn Harith bin Hisham and Abu Salama bin 'Abdur Rahman {#1:768 .italic}

Abu Huraira used to say Takbir in all the prayers, compulsory and optional -- in the month of Ramaḍán or other months. He used to say Takbir on standing for prayer and on bowing; then he would say, "Salmi'a-l-lahu Liman hamida," and before prostrating he would say "Rabbana walaka-l-hamd." Then he would say Takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from the prostration, then another Takbir on prostrating (for the second time), and on raising his head from the prostration. He also would say the Takbir on standing from the second Rak'a. He used to do the same in every Rak'a till he completed the prayer. On completion of the prayer, he would say, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to that of Alláh's Apostle than yours, and this was His prayer till he left this world." And Abu Huraira said, "When Alláh's Apostle raised his head from (bowing) he used to say "Sami' a-l-lahu Liman hamida, Rabbana walakal-hamd." He Would invoke Alláh for some people by naming them: "O Alláh! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham and 'Aiyash bin Abi Rabi'a and the weak and the helpless people among the faithful believers O Alláh! Be hard on the tribe of Mudar and let them suffer from famine years like that of the time of Joseph." In those days the Eastern section of the tribe of Mudar was against the Prophet.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#1:769 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle fell from a horse and the right side of his body was injured. We went to enquire about his health meanwhile it was time for the prayer and he led the prayer sitting and we also prayed while sitting. On completion of the prayer he said, "The Imam is to be followed; say Takbir when he says it; bow when he bows; rise when he rises and when he says "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida," say, "Rabbana walaka-lhamd", and prostrate if he prostrates." Sufyan narrated the same from Ma'mar. Ibn Juraij said that his (the Prophet's) right leg had been injured.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#1:770 .italic}

The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" He replied, "Do you have any doubt in seeing the full moon on a clear (not cloudy) night?" They replied, "No, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Do you have any doubt in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?" They replied in the negative. He said, "You will see Alláh (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Alláh will come to them and say, 'I am Your Lord.' They will say, 'We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Alláh will come to them again and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our Lord.' Alláh will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muḥammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, 'O Alláh! Save us. O Alláh Save us.' There will be hooks like the thorns of Sa'dan in Hell. Have you seen the thorns of Sa'dan?" The people said, "Yes." He said, "These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa'dan but nobody except Alláh knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Alláh intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Alláh has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Alláh had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Alláh! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.' Alláh will ask him, "Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?' He will say, "No by Your (Honor) Power!" And he will give to his Lord (Alláh) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Alláh will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Alláh will. He then will say, 'O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Alláh will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Alláh will say, 'If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Alláh will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Alláh wills and then will say, 'O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.' Alláh will say, May Alláh be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven't you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.' So Alláh will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled . Then Alláh will say, 'Request more of such and such things.' Alláh will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Alláh will say "All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides." Abu Said Al-Khudri, said to Abu Huraira, 'Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh said, 'That is for you and ten times more like it.' "Abu Huraira said, "I do not remember from Alláh's Apostle except (his saying), 'All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides." Abu Sahd said, "I heard him saying, 'That is for you and ten times more the like of it."

Hudhaifa said, "I saw a person not performing his bowing and prostrations perfectly. When he completed the prayer, I told him that he had not prayed." I think that Hudhaifa added (i.e. said to the man), "Had you died, you would have died on a tradition other than that of the Prophet Muḥammad."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#1:773 .italic}

Once I went to Abú- Sa‘íd Al-Khudri and asked him, "Won't you come with us to the date-palm trees to have a talk?" So Abu Said went out and I asked him, "Tell me what you heard from the Prophet about the Night of Qadr." Abu Said replied, "Once Alláh's Apostle performed I'tikaf (seclusion) on the first ten days of the month of Ramaḍán and we did the same with him. Gabriel came to him and said, 'The night you are looking for is ahead of you.' So the Prophet performed the I'tikaf in the middle (second) ten days of the month of Ramaḍán and we too performed I'tikaf with him. Gabriel came to him and said, 'The night which you are looking for is ahead of you.' In the morning of the 20th of Ramaḍán the Prophet delivered a sermon saying, 'Whoever has performed I'tikaf with me should continue it. I have been shown the Night of "Qadr", but have forgotten its date, but it is in the odd nights of the last ten nights. I saw in my dream that I was prostrating in mud and water.' In those days the roof of the mosque was made of branches of date-palm trees. At that time the sky was clear and no cloud was visible, but suddenly a cloud came and it rained. The Prophet led us in the prayer and I saw the traces of mud on the forehead and on the nose of Alláh's Apostle. So it was the confirmation of that dream."

Our Lord! All praises are for You. O Alláh! Forgive me). In this way he was acting on what was explained to him in the Holy Qur’án.

Narrated by Abu Qilaba {#1:782 .italic}

Once Malik bin Huwairith said to his friends, "Shall I show you how Alláh's Apostle used to offer his prayers?" And it was not the time for any of the compulsory congregational prayers. So he stood up (for the prayer) bowed and said the Takbir, then he raised his head and remained standing for a while and then prostrated and raised his head for a while (sat up for a while). He prayed like our S_hayk_h 'Amr Ibn Salama. (Aiyub said, "The latter used to do a thing which I did not see the people doing i.e. he used to sit between the third and the fourth Rak'a). IMalik bin Huwairith said, "We came to the Prophet (after embracing Islam) and stayed with him. He said to us, 'When you go back to your families, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and when there is the time for the prayer then only of you should pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."

He used to stand after the bowing for such a long time that one would think that he had forgotten (the prostrations) and he used to sit in-between the prostrations so long that one would think that he had forgotten the second prostration.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:790 .italic}

I saw ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar crossing his legs while sitting in the prayer and I, a mere youngster in those days, did the same. Ibn ‘Umar forbade me to do so, and said, "The proper way is to keep the right foot propped up and bend the left in the prayer." I said questioningly, "But you are doing so (crossing the legs)." He said, "My feet cannot bear my weight."

Narrated by Muḥammad bin 'Amr bin 'Ata' {#1:791 .italic}

I was sitting with some of the companions of Alláh's Apostle and we were discussing about the way of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid As-Saidi said, "I remember the prayer of Alláh's Apostle better than any one of you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of the shoulders on saying the Takbir; and on bowing he placed his hands on both knees and bent his back straight, then he stood up straight from bowing till all the vertebrate took their normal positions. In prostrations, he placed both his hands on the ground with the forearms away from the ground and away from his body, and his toes were facing the Qibla.

Narrated by Shaqlq bin Salama {#1:794 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh said, "Whenever we prayed behind the Prophet we used to recite (in sitting) 'Peace be on Gabriel, Michael, peace be on so and so. Once Alláh's Apostle looked back at us and said, 'Alláh Himself is As-Salam (Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, At-Tahiyatu lil-lahi wassalawatu wat-taiyibatu. AsSalamu 'alalika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa rahmatu-l-lahi wa barakatuhu. As-Salam alaina wa ala ibadil-lah is-salihin.

Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal-ma thami wal-maghrami. (O Alláh, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave and from the afflictions of Masi,h Ad-Dajjal and from the afflictions of life and death. O Alláh, I seek refuge with You from the sins and from being in debt)." Somebody said to him, "Why do you so frequently seek refuge with Alláh from being in debt?" The Prophet replied, "A person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks promises whenever he makes (them)." 'Aisha also narrated: I heard Alláh's Apostle in his prayer seeking refuge with Alláh from the afflictions of Ad-dajjal.

Narrated by Abu Bakr As-Siddiq {#1:796 .italic}

I asked Alláh's Apostle to teach me an invocation so that I may invoke Alláh with it in my prayer.

I have done great injustice to myself and none except You forgives sins, so please forgive me and be Merciful to me as You are the Forgiver, the Merciful)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:797 .italic}

When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say, "Peace be on Alláh from His slaves and peace be on so and so."

As-salamu 'Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyu warahmatu-l-lahi wa barakatuhu. As-salamu 'alaina wa 'ala ibadillahis-salihin.

I heard from ltban bin Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying, "I used to lead my tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the Prophet and said to him, 'I have weak eye-sight and at times the rainwater flood intervenes between me and the mosque of my tribe and I wish that you would come to my house and pray at some place so that I could take that place as a place for praying (mosque). He said, "Alláh willing, I shall do that." Next day Alláh's Apostle along with Abu Bakr, came to my house after the sun had risen high and he asked permission to enter. I gave him permission, but he didn't sit till he said to me, "Where do you want me to pray in your house?" I pointed to a place in the house where I wanted him to pray. So he stood up for the prayer and we aligned behind him. He completed the prayer with Taslim and we did the same simultaneously."

They have more money by which they perform the Hajj, and 'Umra; fight and struggle in Alláh's Cause and give in charity." The Prophet said, "Shall I not tell you a thing upon which if you acted you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? Nobody would overtake you and you would be better than the people amongst whom you live except those who would do the same. Say "Sub-han-al-lah", "Alhamdu-lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" thirty three times each after every (compulsory) prayer." We differed and some of us said that we should say, "Subhan-al-lah" thirty three times and "Alhamdu lillah" thirty three times and "Allahu Akbar" thirty four times. I went to the Prophet who said, "Say, "Subhan-al-lah" and "Alhamdu lillah" and "Allahu Akbar" all together for thirty three times."

Allahumma la mani 'a lima a'taita, wa la mu'tiya lima mana'ta, wa la yanfa'u dhal-jaddi minka-l-jadd. (None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and He has no partner in Lordship or in worship or in the Names and the Qualities, and for Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are for Him and He is omnipotent. O Alláh! Nobody can hold back what you give and nobody can give what You hold back. Hard (efforts by anyone for anything cannot benefit one against Your Will)."

Ibn Shihab wrote that he had heard it from Hind bint Al-Harith Al-Firasiya from Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet (Hind was from the companions of Um Salama) who said, "When the Prophet finished the prayer with Taslim, the women would depart and enter their houses before Alláh's Apostle departed."

Narrated by 'Uqba {#1:810 .italic}

I offered the 'Asr prayer behind the Prophet at Medina. When he had finished the prayer with Taslim, he got up hurriedly and went out by crossing the rows of the people to one of the dwellings of his wives. The people got scared at his speed . The Prophet came back and found the people surprised at his haste and said to them, "I remembered a piece of gold Lying in my house and I did not like it to divert my attention from Alláh's worship, so I have ordered it to be distributed (in charity)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:811 .italic}

You should not give away a part of your prayer to Satan by thinking that it is necessary to depart (after finishing the prayer) from one's right side only; I have seen the Prophet often leave from the left side.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#1:814 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from our mosque or should remain in his house." (Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh, in another narration said, "Once a big pot containing cooked vegetables was brought. On finding unpleasant smell coming from it, the Prophet asked, 'What is in it?' He was told all the names of the vegetables that were in it. The Prophet ordered that it should be brought near to some of his companions who were with him. When the Prophet saw it he disliked to eat it and said, 'Eat. (I don't eat) for I converse with those whom you don't converse with (i.e. the angels)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz {#1:815 .italic}

A man asked Anas, "What did you hear from the Prophet about garlic?" He said, "The Prophet said, 'Whoever has eaten this plant should neither come near us nor pray with us."

I heard Ash-Sha'bi saying, "A person who was accompanying the Prophet passed by a grave that was separated from the other graves told me that the Prophet once led the people in the (funeral) prayer and the people had aligned behind him.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#1:818 .italic}

One night I slept at the house of my aunt Maimuna and the Prophet slept (too). He got up (for prayer) in the last hours of the night and performed a light ablution from a hanging leather skin. ('Amr, the sub-narrator described that the ablution was very light). Then he stood up for prayer and I got up too and performed the ablution in the same way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right and prayed as much as Alláh will. Then he lay down and slept and I heard his breath sounds till the Mu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him about the (Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer and prayed without repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the subnarrator said: We said to 'Amr, "Some people say, 'The eyes of the Prophet sleep but his heart never sleeps.' " 'Amr said, "'Ubai bin ‘Umar said, 'The dreams of the Prophets are Divine Inspirations. Then he recited, '(O my son), I have seen in dream that I was slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice).") (37.102)

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#1:819 .italic}

My grandmother Mulaika invited Alláh's Apostle for a meal which she had prepared specially for him. He ate some of it and said, "Get up. I shall lead you in the prayer."

Alláh's Apostle stood on it and prayed two Rakat; and the orphan was with me (in the first row), and the old lady stood behind us.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#1:820 .italic}

Once I came riding a she-ass and I, then, had just attained the age of puberty. Alláh's Apostle was leading the people in prayer at Mina facing no wall. I passed in front of the row and let loose the she-ass for grazing and joined the row and no one objected to my deed.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:821 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer till ‘Umar informed him that the women and children had slept. Then Alláh's Apostle came out and said: "None from amongst the dwellers of earth have prayed this prayer except you." In those days none but the people of Medina prayed.

Narrated by 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Abis {#1:822 .italic}

A person asked Ibn ‘Abbás, "Have you ever presented yourself at the ('Id) prayer with Alláh's Apostle?" He replied, "Yes." And had it not been for my kinship (position) with the Prophet it would not have been possible for me to do so (for he was too young). The Prophet went to the mark near the house of Kathir bin As-Salt and delivered a sermon. He then went towards the women. He advised and reminded them and asked them to give alms. So the woman would bring her hand near her neck and take off her necklace and put it in the garment of Bilal. Then the Prophet and Bilal came to the house."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:823 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle delayed the 'Isha' prayer till ‘Umar informed him that the women and children had slept.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:826 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle finished the Fajr prayer, the women would leave covered in their sheets and were not recognized owing to the darkness.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Qatada Al-Ansari {#1:827 .italic}

My father said, "Alláh's Apostle said, "Whenever I stand for prayer, I want to prolong it but on hearing the cries of a child, I would shorten it as I dislike to put its mother in trouble."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#1:828 .italic}

Had Alláh's Apostle known what the women were doing, he would have forbidden them from going to the mosque as the women of Bani Israel had been forbidden. Yaḥyá bin Said (a sub-narrator) asked 'Amra (another sub-narrator), "Were the women of Bani Israel forbidden?" She replied "Yes."

Narrated by Um Salama {#1:829 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle completed the prayer with Taslim, the women used to get up immediately and Alláh's Apostle would remain at his place for someone before getting up. (The sub-narrator (Az-Zuhri) said, "We think, and Alláh knows better, that he did so, so that the women might leave before men could get in touch with them)."

## Volume 2, Book 13

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:1 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) saying, "We (Muslims) are the last (to come) but (will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection though the former nations were given the Holy Scriptures before us. And this was their day (Friday) the celebration of which was made compulsory for them but they differed about it. So Alláh gave us the guidance for it (Friday) and all the other people are behind us in this respect: the Jews' (holy day is) tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) and the Christians' (is) the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:2 .italic}

While ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab was standing and delivering the sermon on a Friday, one of the companions of the Prophet, who was one of the foremost Muḥájirs (emigrants) came. ‘Umar said to him, "What is the time now?" He replied, "I was busy and could not go back to my house till I heard the Adhan. I did not perform more than the ablution." Thereupon ‘Umar said to him, "Did you perform only the ablution although you know that Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) used to order us to take a bath (on Fridays)?"

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#2:4 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male (Muslim) who has attained the age of puberty."

I testify that Alláh's Apostle said, "The taking of a bath on Friday is compulsory for every male Muslim who has attained the age of puberty and (also) the cleaning of his teeth with Siwak, and the using of perfume if it is available." Amr (a sub-narrator) said, "I confirm that the taking of a bath is compulsory, but as for the Siwak and the using of perfume, Alláh knows better whether it is obligatory or not, but according to the Ḥadít_h it is as above.")

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:6 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "Any person who takes a bath on Friday like the bath of Janaba and then goes for the prayer (in the first hour i.e. early), it is as if he had sacrificed a camel (in Alláh's cause); and whoever goes in the second hour it is as if he had sacrificed a cow; and whoever goes in the third hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a horned ram; and if one goes in the fourth hour, then it is as if he had sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg. When the Imam comes out (i.e. starts delivering the Khutba), the angels present themselves to listen to the Khutba."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:7 .italic}

While ‘Umar (bin Al-Khattab) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man entered (the mosque). ‘Umar asked him, "What has detained you from the prayer?" The man said, "It was only that when I heard the Adhan I performed ablution (for the prayer)." On that ‘Umar said, "Did you not hear the Prophet saying: 'Anyone of you going out for the Jumua prayer should take a bath'?".

Narrated by Salmán-Al-Farsi {#2:8 .italic}

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes himself with the scent of his house, then proceeds (for the Jumua prayer) and does not separate two persons sitting together (in the mosque), then prays as much as (Alláh has) written for him and then remains silent while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins in-between the present and the last Friday would be forgiven."

Narrated by Tawus {#2:9 .italic}

I said to Ibn ‘Abbás, "The people are narrating that the Prophet said, 'Take a bath on Friday and wash your heads (i.e. take a thorough bath) even though you were not Junub and use perfume'." On that Ibn ‘Abbás replied, "I know about the bath, (i.e. it is essential) but I do not know about the perfume (i.e. whether it is essential or not.)"

Narrated by Tawus {#2:10 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás mentioned the statement of the Prophet regarding the taking of a bath on Friday and then I asked him whether the Prophet (p.b.u.h) had ordered perfume or (hair) oil to be used if they could be found in one's house. He (Ibn ‘Abbás) replied that he did not know about it.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:11 .italic}

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab saw a silken cloak (being sold) at the gate of the Mosque and said to Alláh's Apostle, "I wish you would buy this to wear on Fridays and also on occasions of the arrivals of the delegations." Alláh's Apostle replied, "This will be worn by a person who will have no share (reward) in the Hereafter." Later on similar cloaks were given to Alláh's Apostle and he gave one of them to ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. On that ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You have given me this cloak although on the cloak of Atarid (a cloak merchant who was selling that silken cloak at the gate of the mosque) you passed such and such a remark." Alláh's Apostle replied, "I have not given you this to wear". And so ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab gave it to his pagan brother in Mecca to wear.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:18 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "All of you are Guardians." Yunis said: Ruzaiq bin Hukaim wrote to Ibn Shihab while I was with him at Wadi-al-Qura saying, "Shall I lead the Jumua prayer?" Ruzaiq was working on the land (i.e farming) and there was a group of Sudanese people and some others with him; Ruzaiq was then the Governor of Aila. Ibn Shihab wrote (to Ruzaiq) ordering him to lead the Jumua prayer and telling him that Salim told him that ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar had said, "I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under your care. The Imam (i.e. ruler) is the guardian of his subjects and is responsible for them and a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's house and is responsible for it. A servant is the guardian of his master's belongings and is responsible for them.' I thought that he also said, 'A man is the guardian of his father's property and is responsible for it. All of you are guardians and responsible for your wards and the things under your care."

They were given the Holy Scripture before us and we were given the Qur’án after them. And this was the day (Friday) about which they differed and Alláh gave us the guidance (for that). So tomorrow (i.e. Saturday) is the Jews' (day), and the day after tomorrow (i.e. Sunday) is the Christians'." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) remained silent (for a while) and then said, "It is obligatory for every Muslim that he should take a bath once in seven days, when he should wash his head and body."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:23 .italic}

One of the wives of ‘Umar (bin Al-Khattab) used to offer the Fajr and the 'Isha' prayer in congregation in the Mosque. She was asked why she had come out for the prayer as she knew that ‘Umar disliked it, and he has great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, "What prevents him from stopping me from this act?" The other replied, "The statement of Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) : 'Do not stop Alláh's women-slave from going to Alláh s Mosques' prevents him."

Narrated by Muḥammad bin Sirin {#2:24 .italic}

On a rainy day Ibn ‘Abbás said to his Muadh-dhin, "After saying, 'Ash-hadu anna Muḥammadan Rasulullah' (I testify that Muḥammad is Alláh's Apostle), do not say 'Haiya 'Alas-Salat' (come for the prayer) but say 'Pray in your houses'." (The man did so). But the people disliked it. Ibn ‘Abbás said, "It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). No doubt, the Jumua prayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush."

Narrated by Aisha {#2:25 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) The people used to come from their abodes and from Al-'Awali (i.e. outskirts of Medina up to a distance of four miles or more from Medina). They used to pass through dust and used to be drenched with sweat and covered with dust; so sweat used to trickle from them. One of them came to Alláh's Apostle who was in my house. The Prophet said to him, "I wish that you keep yourself clean on this day of yours (i.e. take a bath)."

Narrated by Yaḥyá bin Said {#2:26 .italic}

I asked 'Amra about taking a bath on Fridays. She replied, " Aisha said, 'The people used to work (for their livelihood) and whenever they went for the Jumua prayer, they used to go to the mosque in the same shape as they had been in work. So they were asked to take a bath on Friday.' "

Narrated by As-Saib bin Yazíd {#2:36 .italic}

The person who increased the number of Adhans for the Jumua prayers to three was Uthman bin Affan and it was when the number of the (Muslim) people of Medina had increased.

When he said, "Ash-hadu anna Muḥammadan Rasulullah" (I testify that Muḥammad is Alláh's Apostle), Muawiya said, "And (so do) I". When the Adhan was finished, Muawiya said, "O people, when the Muadh-dhin pronounced the Adhan I heard Alláh's Apostle on this very pulpit saying what you have just heard me saying".

Narrated by As-Sa'ib bin Yazíd I {#2:38 .italic}

I heard As-Saib bin Yazíd, saying, "In the life-time of Alláh's Apostle, and Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, the Adhan for the Jumua prayer used to be pronounced after the Imam had taken his seat on the pulpit. But when the people increased in number during the caliphate of 'Uthman, he introduced a third Adhan (on Friday for the Jumua prayer) and it was pronounced at Az-Zaura' and that new state of affairs remained so in the succeeding years.

Narrated by Abu Hazim bin Dinar {#2:40 .italic}

Some people went to Sahl bin Sad As-Sa‘ídi and told him that they had different opinions regarding the wood of the pulpit. They asked him about it and he said, "By Alláh, I know of what wood the pulpit was made, and no doubt I saw it on thy very first day when Alláh's Apostle I took his seat on it. Alláh's Apostle sent for such and such an Ansari woman (and Sahl mentioned her name) and said to her, 'Order your slave-carpenter to prepare for me some pieces of wood (i.e. pulpit) on which I may sit at the time of addressing the people.' So she ordered her slave-carpenter and he made it from the tamarisk of the forest and brought it (to the woman). The woman sent that (pulpit) to Alláh's Apostle who ordered it to be placed here. Then I saw Alláh's Apostle praying on it and then bowed on it. Then he stepped back, got down and prostrated on the ground near the foot of the pulpit and again ascended the pulpit. After finishing the prayer he faced the people and said, 'I have done this so that you may follow me and learn the way I pray.' "

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:41 .italic}

Narrated by 'Amr bin Taghlib {#2:45 .italic}

Some property or something was brought to Alláh's Apostle and he distributed it. He gave to some men and ignored the others. Later he got the news of his being admonished by those whom he had ignored. So he glorified and praised Alláh and said, "Amma ba'du. By Alláh, I may give to a man and ignore another, although the one whom I ignore is more beloved to me than the one whom I give. But I give to some people as I feel that they have no patience and no contentment in their hearts and I leave those who are patient and self-contented with the goodness and wealth which Alláh has put into their hearts and 'Amr bin Taghlib is one of them." Amr added, By Alláh! Those words of Alláh's Apostle are more beloved to me than the best red camels.

Narrated by Aisha {#2:46 .italic}

Once in the middle of the night Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed with him. The next morning the people spoke about it and so more people gathered and prayed with him (in the second night). They circulated the news in the morning, and so, on the third night the number of people increased greatly. Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came out and they prayed behind him. On the fourth night the mosque was overwhelmed by the people till it could not accommodate them. Alláh's Apostle came out only for the Fajr prayer and when he finished the prayer, he faced the people and recited "Tashah-hud" (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and that Muḥammad is His Apostle), and then said, "Amma ba'du. Verily your presence (in the mosque at night) was not hidden from me, but I was afraid that this prayer (Prayer of Tahajjud) might be made compulsory and you might not be able to carry it out."

Narrated by Abu Hummaid As-Sa‘ídi {#2:47 .italic}

He glorified and praised Alláh and said, "O people! Come to me." So the people came and gathered around him and he then said, "Amma ba'du." "From now onward the Ansar will decrease and other people will increase. So anybody who becomes a ruler of the followers of Muḥammad and has the power to harm or benefit people then he should accept the good from the benevolent amongst them (Ansar) and overlook the faults of their wrong-doers."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh Ibn ‘Umar {#2:50 .italic}

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:51 .italic}

The Prophet said, "When it is a Friday, the angels stand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons coming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a ram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out (for Jumua prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the Khutba."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:52 .italic}

While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man stood up and said, "O, Alláh's Apostle! The livestock and the sheep are dying, so pray to Alláh for rain." So he (the Prophet) raised both his hands and invoked Alláh (for it).

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#2:55 .italic}

Once in the lifetime of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) the people were afflicted with drought (famine). While the Prophet was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, "O, Alláh's Apostle! Our possessions are being destroyed and the children are hungry; Please invoke Alláh (for rain)". So the Prophet raised his hands. At that time there was not a trace of cloud in the sky. By Him in Whose Hands my soul is as soon as he lowered his hands, clouds gathered like mountains, and before he got down from the pulpit, I saw the rain falling on the beard of the Prophet. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day till the next Friday. The same Bedouin or another man stood up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The houses have collapsed, our possessions and livestock have been drowned; Please invoke Alláh (to protect us)". So the Prophet I raised both his hands and said, "O Alláh! Round about us and not on us". So, in whatever direction he pointed with his hands, the clouds dispersed and cleared away, and Medina's (sky) became clear as a hole in between the clouds. The valley of Qanat remained flooded, for one month, none came from outside but talked about the abundant rain.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:56 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "When the Imam is delivering the Khutba, and you ask your companion to keep quiet and listen, then no doubt you have done an evil act."

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) talked about Friday and said, "There is an hour (opportune time) on Friday and if a Muslim gets it while praying and asks something from Alláh, then Alláh will definitely meet his demand." And he (the Prophet) pointed out the shortness of that time with his hands.

While we were praying (Jumua Khutba & prayer) with the Prophet (p.b.u.h), some camels loaded with food, arrived (from Sham.~ The people diverted their attention towards the camels (and left the mosque), and only twelve persons remained with the Prophet. So this verse was revealed: "But when they see Some bargain or some amusement, They disperse headlong to it, And leave you standing." (62.11)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:59 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to pray two Rakat before the Zuhr prayer and two Rakat after it. He also used to pray two Rakat after the Maghrib prayer in his house, and two Rakat after the 'Isha' prayer. He never prayed after Jumua prayer till he departed (from the Mosque), and then he would pray two Rakat at home.

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#2:60 .italic}

There was a woman amongst us who had a farm and she used to sow Silq (a kind of vegetable) on the edges of streams in her farm. On Fridays she used to pull out the Silq from its roots and put the roots in a utensil. Then she would put a handful of powdered barley over it and cook it. The roots of the Silq were a substitute for meat. After finishing the Jumua prayer we used to greet her and she would give us that food which we would eat with our hands, and because of that meal, we used to look forward to Friday.

Narrated by Shu'aib {#2:64 .italic}

I asked Az-Zuhri, "Did the Prophet ever offer the Fear Prayer?" Az-Zuhri said, "I was told by Salim that ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar I had said, 'I took part in a holy battle with Alláh's Apostle I in Najd. We faced the enemy and arranged ourselves in rows. Then Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) stood up to lead the prayer and one party stood to pray with him while the other faced the enemy. Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and the former party bowed and performed two prostrations. Then that party left and took the place of those who had not prayed. Alláh's Apostle prayed one Raka (with the latter) and performed two prostrations and finished his prayer with Taslim. Then everyone of them bowed once and performed two prostrations individually.' "

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:65 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar said something similar to Mujahid's saying: Whenever (Muslims and non-Muslims) stand face to face in battle, the Muslims can pray while standing. Ibn ‘Umar added, "The Prophet said, 'If the number of the enemy is greater than the Muslims, they can pray while standing or riding (individually).' "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:66 .italic}

Once the Prophet (p.b.u.h) led the fear prayer and the people stood behind him. He said Takbir (Allahu-Akbar) and the people said the same. He bowed and some of them bowed. Then he prostrated and they also prostrated. Then he stood for the second Raka and those who had prayed the first Raka left and guarded their brothers. The second party joined him and performed bowing and prostration with him. All the people were in prayer but they were guarding one another during the prayer.

On the day of the Khandaq ‘Umar came, cursing the disbelievers of Quraish and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have not offered the 'Asr prayer and the sun has set." The Prophet replied, "By Alláh!

Alláh's Apostle vanquished them by force and their warriors were killed; the children and women were taken as captives. Safiya was taken by Dihya Al-Kalbi and later she belonged to Alláh's Apostle go who married her and her Mahr was her manumission.

‘Umar bought a silk cloak from the market, took it to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Take it and adorn yourself with it during the 'Id and when the delegations visit you." Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) replied, "This dress is for those who have no share (in the Hereafter)." After a long period Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent to ‘Umar a cloak of silk brocade. ‘Umar came to Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) with the cloak and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You said that this dress was for those who had no share (in the Hereafter); yet you have sent me this cloak." Alláh's Apostle said to him, "Sell it and fulfill your needs by it."

Narrated by Aisha {#2:70 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) came to my house while two girls were singing beside me the songs of Buath (a story about the war between the two tribes of the Ansar, the Khazraj and the Aus, before Islam). The Prophet (p.b.u.h) lay down and turned his face to the other side. Then Abu Bakr came and spoke to me harshly saying, "Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ?" Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) turned his face towards him and said, "Leave them." When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signalled to those girls to go out and they left. It was the day of 'Id, and the Black people were playing with shields and spears; so either I requested the Prophet (p.b.u.h) or he asked me whether I would like to see the display. I replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) made me stand behind him and my cheek was touching his cheek and he was saying, "Carry on! O Bani Arfida," till I got tired. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked me, "Are you satisfied (Is that sufficient for you)?" I replied in the affirmative and he told me to leave.

Narrated by Al-Bara' {#2:71 .italic}

I heard the Prophet (p.b.u.h) delivering a Khutba saying, "The first thing to be done on this day (first day of 'Id ul Adha) is to pray; and after returning from the prayer we slaughter our sacrifices (in the name of Alláh) and whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (traditions)."

Narrated by Aisha {#2:72 .italic}

Abu Bakr came to my house while two small Ansari girls were singing beside me the stories of the Ansar concerning the Day of Buath. And they were not singers. Abu Bakr said protestingly, "Musical instruments of Satan in the house of Alláh's Apostle !" It happened on the 'Id day and Alláh's Apostle said, "O Abu Bakr! There is an 'Id for every nation and this is our 'Id."

The Prophet said, "Whoever slaughtered (his sacrifice) before the 'Id prayer, should slaughter again." A man stood up and said, "This is the day on which one has desire for meat," and he mentioned something about his neighbors. It seemed that the Prophet I believed him. Then the same man added, "I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than the meat of two sheep." The Prophet permitted him to slaughter it as a sacrifice. I do not know whether that permission was valid only for him or for others as well.

Narrated by Al-Bara' bin 'Azib {#2:75 .italic}

The Prophet delivered the Khutba after offering the prayer on the Day of Nahr and said, "Whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his Nusuk (sacrifice) will be accepted by Alláh. And whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the 'Id prayer then he has not done the sacrifice." Abi Burda bin Niyar, the uncle of Al-Bara' said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have slaughtered my sheep before the 'Id prayer and I thought today as a day of eating and drinking (not alcoholic drinks), and I liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house. So slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer." The Prophet said, "The sheep which you have slaughtered is just mutton (not a Nusuk)." He (Abu Burda) said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have a young she-goat which is dearer to me than two sheep. Will that be sufficient as a Nusuk on my behalf? "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Yes, it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient (as a Nusuk) for anyone else after you."

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#2:76 .italic}

The Prophet used to proceed to the Musalla on the days of Id-ul-Fitr and Id-ul-Adha; the first thing to begin with was the prayer and after that he would stand in front of the people and the people would keep sitting in their rows. Then he would preach to them, advise them and give them orders, (i.e. Khutba). And after that if he wished to send an army for an expedition, he would do so; or if he wanted to give and order, he would do so, and then depart. The people followed this tradition till I went out with Marwan, the Governor of Medina, for the prayer of Id-ul-Adha or Id-ul-Fitr. When we reached the Musalla, there was a pulpit made by Kathir bin As-Salt. Marwan wanted to get up on that pulpit before the prayer. I got hold of his clothes but he pulled them and ascended the pulpit and delivered the Khutba before the prayer. I said to him, "By Alláh, you have changed (the Prophet's tradition)." He replied, "O Abu Sa‘íd! Gone is that which you know." I said, "By Alláh! What I know is better than what I do not know." Marwan said, "People do not sit to listen to our Khutba after the prayer, so I delivered the Khutba before the prayer."

A person from the Ansar named Abu Burda bin Niyyar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I slaughtered the Nusuk (before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep."

A man stood up and said, "O, Alláh's Apostle! I slaughtered (the animal before the prayer) but I have a young she-goat which is better than an older sheep."

After finishing it he got down (from the pulpit) and went towards the women and advised them while he was leaning on Bilal's hand. Bilal was spreading out his garment where the women were putting their alms." I asked 'Ata' whether it was the Zakat of 'Id ul Fitr. He said, "No, it was just alms given at that time. Some lady put her finger ring and the others would do the same." I said, (to 'Ata'), "Do you think that it is incumbent upon the Imam to give advice to the women (on 'Id day)?" He said, "No doubt, it is incumbent upon the Imams to do so and why should they not do so?" Al-Ḥasan bin Muslim told me that Ibn ‘Abbás had said, "I join the Prophet, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and 'Uthman in the 'Id ul Fitr prayers. They used to offer the prayer before the Khutba and then they used to deliver the Khutba afterwards. Once the Prophet I came out (for the 'Id prayer) as if I were just observing him waving to the people to sit down. He, then accompanied by Bilal, came crossing the rows till he reached the women. He recited the following verse: 'O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of fealty to you . . . (to the end of the verse) (60.12).' After finishing the recitation he said, "O ladies! Are you fulfilling your covenant?" None except one woman said, "Yes." Ḥasan did not know who was that woman. The Prophet said, "Then give alms." Bilal spread his garment and said, "Keep on giving alms. Let my father and mother sacrifice their lives for you (ladies)." So the ladies kept on putting their Fatkhs (big rings) and other kinds of rings in Bilal's garment." Abdur-Razaq said, " 'Fatkhs' is a big ring which used to be worn in the (Pre-lslamic) period of ignorance.

She said, 'The husband of my sister took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and my sister was with her husband in six of them. My sister said that they used to nurse the sick and treat the wounded. Once she asked, 'O Alláh's Apostle! If a woman has no veil, is there any harm if she does not come out (on 'Id day)?' The Prophet said, 'Her companion should let her share her veil with her, and the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.' " Hafsa added, "When Um-'Atiya came, I went to her and asked her, 'Did you hear anything about so-and-so?' Um-'Atlya said, 'Yes, let my father be sacrificed for the Prophet (p.b.u.h).

He said, 'Virgin mature girls staying often screened (or said, 'Mature girls and virgins staying often screened--Aiyub is not sure as which was right) and menstruating women should come out (on the 'Id day). But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla. And all the women should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers'." Hafsa said, "On that I said to Um-'Atiya, 'Also those who are menstruating?' " Um-'Atiya replied, "Yes. Do they not present themselves at 'Arafat and elsewhere?".

Abu Burda bin Naiyar stood up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh, I slaughtered my sacrifice before I offered the (Id) prayer and thought that today was the day of eating and drinking (non-alcoholic drinks) and so I made haste (in slaughtering) and ate and also fed my family and neighbors." Alláh's Apostle said, "That was just mutton (not a sacrifice)." Then Abu Burda said, "I have a young she-goat and no doubt, it is better than two sheep.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:105 .italic}

Once a person asked Alláh's Apostle about the night prayer. Alláh's Apostle replied, "The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all the Rakat which he has prayed before." Nafi' told that ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar used to say Taslim between (the first) two Rakat and (the third) odd one in the Witr prayer, when he wanted to attend to a certain matter (during that interval between the Rakat).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:106 .italic}

Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Alláh's Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat "Aal-Imran." Alláh's Apostle went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:107 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and if you want to finish it, pray only one Raka which will be Witr for all the previous Rakat." Al-Qasim said, "Since we attained the age of puberty we have seen some people offering a three-Rakat prayer as Witr and all that is permissible. I hope there will be no harm in it."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:108 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to pray eleven Rakat at night and that was his night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough for one of you to recite fifty verses before Alláh's Apostle raised his head. He also used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the (compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the Muadh-dhin came to him for the prayer.

Narrated by Anas bin Sirin {#2:109 .italic}

I asked Ibn ‘Umar, "What is your opinion about the two Rakat before the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in them?" He said, "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the Adhan." (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, "That meant (that he prayed) quickly.)"

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:110 .italic}

I was going to Mecca in the company of ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar and when I apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr prayer and then joined him. ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "Where have you been?" I replied, "I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted and prayed the Witr prayer." ‘Abdu’lláh said, "Isn't it sufficient for you to follow the good example of Alláh's Apostle?" I replied, "Yes, by Alláh." He said, "Alláh's Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of the camel (while on a journey)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:114 .italic}

The Prophet used to offer (Nawafil) prayers on his Rahila (mount) facing its direction by signals, but not the compulsory prayer. He also used to pray Witr on his (mount) Rahila.

Anas was asked, "Did the Prophet recite Qunut in the Fajr prayer?" Anas replied in the affirmative. He was further asked, "Did he recite Qunut before bowing?" Anas replied, "He recited Qunut after bowing for some time (for one month)."

Narrated by 'Asim {#2:116 .italic}

I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, "Definitely it was (recited)". I asked, "Before bowing or after it?" Anas replied, "Before bowing." I added, "So and so has told me that you had informed him that it had been after bowing." Anas said, "He told an untruth (i.e. "was mistaken," according to the Hijazi dialect). Alláh's Apostle recited Qunut after bowing for a period of one month." Anas added, "The Prophet sent about seventy men (who knew the Qur’án by heart) towards the pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty between them and Alláh's Apostles (but the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Alláh's Apostle recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Alláh to punish them."

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) went out to offer the Istisqa' prayer and turned (and put on) his cloak inside out.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:120 .italic}

Whenever the Prophet (p.b.u.h) lifted his head from the bowing in the last Raka he used to say: "O Alláh! Save 'Aiyash bin Abi Rabi'a. O Alláh! Save Salama bin Hisham. O Alláh! Save Walid bin Walid. O Alláh! Save the weak faithful believers. O Alláh! Be hard on the tribes of Mudar and send (famine) years on them like the famine years of (Prophet) Joseph ." The Prophet further said, "Alláh forgive the tribes of Ghifar and save the tribes of Aslam." Abu Az-Zinad (a sub-narrator) said, "The Qunut used to be recited by the Prophet in the Fajr prayer."

Narrated by Masruq {#2:121 .italic}

We were with ‘Abdu’lláh and he said, "When the Prophet saw the refusal of the people to accept Islam he said, "O Alláh! Send (famine) years on them for (seven years) like the seven years (of famine during the time) of (Prophet) Joseph." So famine overtook them for one year and destroyed every kind of life to such an extent that the people started eating hides, carcasses and rotten dead animals. Whenever one of them looked towards the sky, he would (imagine himself to) see smoke because of hunger. So Abu Sufyan went to the Prophet and said, "O Muḥammad! You order people to obey Alláh and to keep good relations with kith and kin. No doubt the people of your tribe are dying, so please pray to Alláh for them." So Alláh revealed: "Then watch you For the day that The sky will bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible ... Verily! You will return (to disbelief) On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp. (44.10-16) Ibn Masud added, "Al-Batsha (i.e. grasp) happened in the battle of Badr and no doubt smoke, Al-Batsha, Al-Lizam, and the verse of Surat Ar-Rum have all passed .

He did not get down till the rain water flowed profusely from every roof-g utter: And a white (person) who is requested to pray for rain and who takes care of the orphans and is the guardian of widows . . . And these were the words of Abu Talib."

Anas added, "A heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Sila' Mountain). When it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained." Anas further said, "By Alláh! We could not see the sun for a week. Next Friday a person entered through the same gate and at that time Alláh's Apostle was delivering the Friday's Khutba.

One day I went to Ibn Masud who said, "When Quraish delayed in embracing Islam, the Prophet I invoked Alláh to curse them, so they were afflicted with a (famine) year because of which many of them died and they ate the carcasses and Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, 'O Muḥammad! You came to order people to keep good relation with kith and kin and your nation is being destroyed, so invoke Alláh I ? So the Prophet I recited the Holy verses of Sirat-Ad-Dukhan: 'Then watch you For the day that The sky will Bring forth a kind Of smoke Plainly visible.' (44.10) When the famine was taken off, the people renegade once again as nonbelievers. The statement of Alláh, (in Sura "Ad-Dukhan"-44) refers to that: 'On the day when We shall seize You with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was what happened on the day of the battle of Badr." Asbath added on the authority of Mansur, "Alláh's Apostle prayed for them and it rained heavily for seven days. So the people complained of the excessive rain. The Prophet said, 'O Alláh! (Let it rain) around us and not on us.' So the clouds dispersed over his head and it rained over the surroundings."

By Alláh, there was no trace of cloud in the sky and suddenly the sky became overcast with clouds and it started raining. The Prophet came down the pulpit and offered the prayer. When he came back from the prayer (to his house) it was raining and it rained continuously till the next Friday. When the Prophet started delivering the Friday Khutba (sermon), the people started shouting and said to him, "The houses have collapsed and the roads are cut off; so please pray to Alláh to withhold the rain." So the Prophet smiled and said, "O Alláh! Round about us and not on us." So the sky became clear over Medina but it kept on raining over the outskirts (of Medina) and not a single drop of rain fell over Median. I looked towards the sky which was as bright and clear as a crown.

Alláh's Apostle raised both his hands towards the sky and at that time there was not a trace of cloud in they sky. Then the clouds started gathering like mountains. Before he got down from the pulpit I saw rain-water trickling down his beard. It rained that day, the next day, the third day, the fourth day and till the next Friday, when the same Bedouin or some other person stood up (during the Friday Khutba) and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The houses have collapsed and the livestock are drowned. Please invoke Alláh for us." So Alláh's Apostle raised both his hands and said, "O Alláh! Around us and not on us."

The valley of Qanat remained flowing (with water) for one month and none, came from outside who didn't talk about the abundant rain.

He stood up again and performed a long Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and glorifying Alláh he said, "The sun and the moon are two signs against the signs of Alláh; they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Alláh and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa." The Prophet then said, "O followers of Muḥammad! By Alláh! There is none who has more ghaira (self-respect) than Alláh as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of Muḥammad! By Alláh! If you knew that which I know you would laugh little and weep much.

He again said Takbir and then bowed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first one and then said, "Sami 'a-l-lahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walak-lhamd, (Alláh heard him who sent his praises to Him. O our Sustainer! All the praises are for You)" and then prostrated and did the same in the second Raka; thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse) had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood up, glorified and praised Alláh as He deserved and then said, "The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Alláh. They do not eclipse because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see them make haste for the prayer."

By then, the sun (eclipse) had cleared. The Prophet then said, "The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Alláh. They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Alláh." The people say, "O Alláh's Apostle! We saw you taking something from your place and then we saw you retreating." The Prophet replied, "I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women." The people asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why is it so?" The Prophet replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Alláh. The Prophet said, "They are ungrateful to their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, 'I have never had any good from you.' "

Asmá’ further said, "I too then stood up for the prayer till I fainted and then poured water on my head. When Alláh's Apostle had finished his prayer, he thanked and praised Alláh and said, 'I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen even Paradise and Hell. No doubt, it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trial in the graves like or nearly like the trial of (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asmá’ said.) (The angels) will come to everyone of you and will ask what do you know about this man (i.e. Muḥammad). The believer or a firm believer (I do not know which word Asmá’ said) will reply, 'He is Muḥammad, Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) who came to us with clear evidences and guidance, so we accepted his teachings, believed and followed him.' The angels will then say to him, 'Sleep peacefully as we knew surely that you were a firm believer.' The hypocrite or doubtful person (I do not know which word Asmá’ said) will say, 'I do not know.

A Jewess came to 'Aisha to ask her about something and then she said, "May Alláh give you refuge from the punishment of the grave." So 'Aisha asked Alláh's Apostle, "Would the people be punished in their graves?" Alláh's Apostle asked Alláh's refuge from the punishment of the grave (indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Alláh's Apostle rode (to leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He returned on the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood up and started offering the (eclipse) prayer and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long period and then performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing, then he raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while, but the standing was shorter than the standing of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a long time but shorter than the first, then again performed a long bowing which was shorter than the first and then prostrated for a shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then he finished the prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Alláh wished; and ordered the people to seek refuge with Alláh from the punishment of the grave.

So whenever you see them, make haste for the prayer."

So when you see anything thereof, proceed to remember Alláh, invoke Him and ask for His forgiveness."

In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza'i and others said that they had heard Az-Zuhi from 'Ursa from 'Aisha saying, "In the life-time of Alláh's Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: 'Prayer in congregation.' He led the prayer and performed four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat." Narrated Al-Walid that 'Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhrl said, "I asked ('Ursa), 'What did your brother ‘Abdu’lláh bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in Median.' 'Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray according to) the Prophet's tradition."

I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, "I seek refuge with Alláh from the Fire." Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Alláh's Apostle.

And none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, And Alláh is Great And there is neither Might nor Power Except with Alláh). And then says: -- Allahumma, Ighfir li(O Alláh! Forgive me).

He showed us the guidance, after we were blind. We believe that whatever he says will come true. And he spends his nights in such a way as his sides do not touch his bed. While the pagans were deeply asleep."

Hafsa narrated one of my dreams to the Prophet and the Prophet said, "‘Abdu’lláh is a good man. Would that he offer the night prayer (Tahajjud)!" So after that day ‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Umar) started offering Tahajjud. The companions of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to tell him their dreams that (Laila-tul-Qadr) was on the 27th of the month of Ramaḍán.

He said, "If anyone of you thinks of doing any job he should offer a two Rakat prayer other than the compulsory ones and say (after the prayer): -- 'Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi'ilmika, Wa astaqdiruka bi-qudratika, Wa as'alaka min fadlika al-'azlm Fa-innaka taqdiru Wala aqdiru, Wa ta'lamu Wala a'lamu, Wa anta 'allamu l-ghuyub.

Waqdir li al-khaira haithu kana Thumma ardini bihi.' (O Alláh! I ask guidance from Your knowledge, And Power from Your Might and I ask for Your great blessings. You are capable and I am not. You know and I do not and You know the unseen. O Alláh! If You know that this job is good for my religion and my subsistence and in my Hereafter--(or said: If it is better for my present and later needs)--Then You ordain it for me and make it easy for me to get, And then bless me in it, and if You know that this job is harmful to me In my religion and subsistence and in the Hereafter--(or said: If it is worse for my present and later needs)--Then keep it away from me and let me be away from it. And ordain for me whatever is good for me, And make me satisfied with it). The Prophet added that then the person should name (mention) his need.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:279 .italic}

That he remembered Alláh's Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Maḥmúd said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Alláh's Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, "I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Alláh's Apostle and said, 'I have weak eye-sight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.' Alláh's Apostle said, 'I will do so.' So Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Alláh's Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, 'Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?' I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Alláh's Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called "Khazir" which I had prepared for him.--("Khazir" is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)-- When the neighbors got the news that Alláh's Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, 'What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?' One of them replied, 'He is a hypocrite and does not love Alláh and His Apostle.' On that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Don't say this. Haven't you seen that he said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh for Alláh's sake only.' The man replied, 'Alláh and His Apostle know better; but by Alláh, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.' Alláh's Apostle replied, 'No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, and by that he wants the pleasures of Alláh, then Alláh will save him from Hell." Maḥmúd added, "I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Alláh's Apostle in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazíd bin Mu'aw7ya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, 'I doubt that Alláh's Apostle ever said what you have said.' I felt that too much, and I vowed to Alláh that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or 'Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time."

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, "I slept across the bed, and Alláh's Apostle along with his wife slept lengthwise. Alláh's Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly before or after it. Then Alláh's Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer." ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás added, "I got up and did the same as Alláh's Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Alláh's Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat and then offered one Raka Witr.

Will you lead the people in the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, if you wish." So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Alláh and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Ḥadít_h No. 295 & 296)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Masud {#2:294 .italic}

We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer. Alláh's Apostle heard it and said:--"Say, 'At-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu 'Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa-rahmatu-l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-'ala 'ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muḥammadan 'abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Alláh and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Alláh). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Alláh's mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Alláh. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and that Muḥammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worship per of Alláh, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:295 .italic}

My mother (is calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)' She said, 'O Alláh! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.' A shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his hermitage. Juraij said, 'Where is that woman who claims that her child is from me?' (When she was brought to him along with the child), Juraij asked the child, 'O Babus, who is your father?' The child replied, 'The shepherd.' " (See Ḥadít_h No 662. Vol 3).

No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, 'My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' Then Alláh made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated)."

We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal. (Shu'ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, "O Alláh! Be harsh to this s_hayk_h." And when the s_hayk_h (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, "I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Alláh's Apostle in six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. "

Once the sun eclipsed and Alláh's Apostle stood up for the prayer and recited a very long Sura and when bowed for a long while and then raised his head and started reciting another Sura. Then he bowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and then said, "These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Alláh and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Alláh and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and in it I saw 'Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals (set them free) in the name of idols."

When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, "O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, 'Sub Han Alláh'."

Once the meal of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf was brought in front of him, and he said, "Mustab bin ‘Umar was martyred and he was better than I, and he had nothing except his Burd (a black square narrow dress) to be shrouded in. Hamza or another person was martyred and he was also better than I and he had nothing to be shrouded in except his Burd. No doubt, I fear that the rewards of my deeds might have been given early in this world." Then he started weeping.

Hamza was martyred and was better than I. Now the worldly wealth have been bestowed upon us (or said a similar thing). No doubt, I fear that the rewards of my deeds might have been given earlier in this world." Then he started weeping and left his food.

Narrated by Khabbab {#2:366 .italic}

We emigrated with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) in Alláh's cause, and so our reward was then surely incumbent on Alláh. Some of us died and they did not take anything from their rewards in this world, and amongst them was Mustab bin ‘Umar; and the others were those who got their rewards. Mustab bin ‘Umar was martyred on the day of the Battle of Uhud and we could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And when we covered his head his feet became bare and vice versa. So the Prophet ordered us to cover his head only and to put idhkhir (a kind of shrub) over his feet.

Narrated by Sahl {#2:367 .italic}

A woman brought a woven Burda (sheet) having edging (border) to the Prophet, Then Sahl asked them whether they knew what is Burda, they said that Burda is a cloak and Sahl confirmed their reply. Then the woman said, "I have woven it with my own hands and I have brought it so that you may wear it." The Prophet accepted it, and at that time he was in need of it. So he came out wearing it as his waist-sheet. A man praised it and said, "Will you give it to me? How nice it is!" The other people said, "You have not done the right thing as the Prophet is in need of it and you have asked for it when you know that he never turns down anybody's request." The man replied, "By Alláh, I have not asked for it to wear it but to make it my shroud." Later it was his shroud.

There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), "Go and see who those travelers are." So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to ‘Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, "Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers." Later, when ‘Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, "O my brother, O my friend!" (on this ‘Umar said to him, "O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, "The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?" Ibn ‘Abbás added, "When ‘Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, 'May Alláh be merciful to ‘Umar. By Alláh, Alláh's Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Alláh increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives." Aisha further added, "The Qur’án is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Alláh has stated: 'No burdened soul will bear another's burden.' " (35.18). Ibn ‘Abbás then said, "Only Alláh makes one laugh or cry." Ibn ‘Umar did not say anything after that.

Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?' He said, 'No.' I asked, 'Half?' He said, 'No.' then he added, 'One-third, and even one-third is much. You'd better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Alláh's sake, even for what you put in your wife's mouth.' I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?' He said, 'If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Alláh!

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:431 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle shrouded every two martyrs of Uhud in one piece of cloth and then he would ask, "Which of them knew more Qur’án?" When one of them was pointed out he would put him first in the grave. He said, "I am a witness on these." Then he ordered them to be buried with blood on their bodies. Neither did he offer their funeral prayer nor did he get them washed. (Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh added): Alláh's Apostle used to ask about the martyrs of Uhud as to which of them knew more of the Qur’án." And when one of them was pointed out as having more of it he would put him first in the grave and then his companions. (Jabir added): My father and my uncle were shrouded in one sheet.

The Prophet said, "Alláh has made Mecca a sanctuary (sacred place) and it was a sanctuary before me and will be so after me. It was made legal for me (to fight in it) for a few hours of the day. None is allowed to uproot its thorny shrubs or to cut its trees or to chase its game or to pick up its fallen things except by a person who announces it publicly." On that Al-‘Abbás said (to the Prophet), "Except Al-Idhkhir for our goldsmiths and for our graves." And so the Prophet added, "Except Al-Idhkhir. " And Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, "Except Al-Idhkhir for our graves and houses." And Ibn ‘Abbás said, "For their goldsmiths and houses."

Alláh's Apostle came to ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai (a hypocrite) after his death and he has been laid in his pit (grave). He ordered (that he be taken out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on his knees and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his (the Prophet's) own shirt. Alláh knows better (why he did so). ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-‘Abbás to wear. Abu Harun said, "Alláh's Apostle at that time had two shirts and the son of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai said to him, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Clothe my father in your shirt which has been in contact with your skin.' ' Sufyan added, "Thus people think that the Prophet clothed ‘Abdu’lláh bin Tubal in his shirt in lieu of what he (‘Abdu’lláh) had done (for Al ‘Abbás, the Prophet's uncle.)"

Narrated by Jabir {#2:434 .italic}

When the time of the Battle of Uhud approached, my father called me at night and said, "I think that I will be the first amongst the companions of the Prophet to be martyred. I do not leave anyone after me dearer to me than you, except Alláh's Apostle's soul and I owe some debt and you should repay it and treat your sisters favorably (nicely and politely)." So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and was buried along with another (martyr). I did not like to leave him with the other (martyr) so I took him out of the grave after six months of his burial and he was in the same condition as he was on the day of burial, except a slight change near his ear.

Narrated by Jabir {#2:435 .italic}

A man was buried along with my father and I did not like it till I took him (i.e. my father) out and buried him in a separate grave.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:436 .italic}

The Prophet collected every two martyrs of Uhud (in one grave) and then he would ask, "Which of them knew the Qur’án more?" And if one of them was pointed out for him as having more knowledge, he would put him first in the Lahd. The Prophet said, "I will be a witness on these on the Day of Resurrection." Then he ordered them to be buried with their blood on their bodies and he did not have them washed.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:437 .italic}

‘Umar set out along with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, "Do you testify that I am Alláh's Apostle?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, "I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates." Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), "Do you testify that I am Alláh's Apostle?" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, "I believe in Alláh and His Apostles." Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), "What do you think?" Ibn Saiyad answered, "True people and liars visit me." The Prophet said, "You have been confused as to this matter." Then the Prophet said to him, "I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)" Ibn Saiyad said, "It is Al-Dukh (the smoke)." (2) The Prophet said, "Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits." On that ‘Umar, said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him." (Ibn ‘Umar added): Later on Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka'b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw Alláh's Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, "O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muḥammad." And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, "Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.

A young Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet and he became sick. So the Prophet went to visit him. He sat near his head and asked him to embrace Islam. The boy looked at his father, who was sitting there; the latter told him to obey Abu-l-Qasim and the boy embraced Islam. The Prophet came out saying: "Praises be to Alláh Who saved the boy from the Hell-fire."

Narrated by Ibn Shihab {#2:440 .italic}

The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Alláh Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, "Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Alláh Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?" Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: 'The pure Alláh's Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Alláh Alone), with which He has created human beings.' " (30.30).

Narrated by Said bin Al-Musaiyab from his father {#2:442 .italic}

When the time of the death of Abu Talib approached, Alláh's Apostle went to him and found Abu Jahl bin Hisham and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Umaiya bin Al-Mughira by his side. Alláh's Apostle said to Abu Talib, "O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Alláh. Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Umaiya said, "O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib?" Alláh's Apostle kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh') while they (Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib and refused to say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh.' (Then Alláh's Apostle said, "I will keep on asking Alláh's forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Alláh) to do so." So Alláh revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Alláh) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:443 .italic}

The Prophet once passed by two graves, and those two persons (in the graves) were being tortured. He said, "They are being tortured not for a great thing (to avoid). One of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine, while the other was going about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends). He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why have you done so?" He replied, "I hope that their punishment may be lessened till they (the leaf) become dry."

" We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi-I-Gharqad. The Prophet came to us and sat and we sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand then he bent his head and started scraping the ground with it. He then said, "There is none among you, and not a created soul, but has place either in Paradise or in Hell assigned for him and it is also determined for him whether he will be among the blessed or wretched." A man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?" The Prophet said, "The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched." Then he recited the Verses:-- "As for him who gives (in charity) and is Alláh-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Alláh. " (92.5-6)

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever intentionally swears falsely by a religion other than Islam, then he is what he has said, (e.g. if he says, 'If such thing is not true then I am a Jew,' he is really a Jew). And whoever commits suicide with piece of iron will be punished with the same piece of iron in the Hell Fire." Narrated Jundab the Prophet said, "A man was inflicted with wounds and he committed suicide, and so Alláh said: My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I forbid Paradise for him."

The Prophet said, "He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire."

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul died, Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was called upon to offer his funeral prayer. When Alláh's Apostle stood up to offer the prayer, I got up quickly and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Are you going to pray for Ibn Ubai and he said so and so on such and such occasions?" And started mentioning all that he had said. Alláh's Apostle smiled and said, "O ‘Umar! Go away from me." When I talked too much he said, "I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the prayer). Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for Alláh's forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have done so." (‘Umar added): Alláh's Apostle offered his funeral prayer and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara' were revealed: i.e. "And never (O Muḥammad) pray for any of them who dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)" -- (‘Umar added), "Later I astonished at my daring before Alláh's Apostle on that day. And Alláh and His Apostle know better."

A funeral procession passed and the people praised the deceased. The Prophet said, "It has been affirmed to him." Then another funeral procession passed and the people spoke badly of the deceased. The Prophet said, "It has been affirmed to him". ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asked (Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ), "What has been affirmed?" He replied, "You praised this, so Paradise has been affirmed to him; and you spoke badly of this, so Hell has been affirmed to him. You people are Alláh's witnesses on earth."

A third (funeral procession) passed by and the people spoke badly of the deceased. He said, "It has been affirmed to him." I (Abu Al-Aswad) asked, "O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?" He replied, "I said the same as the Prophet had said, that is: if four persons testify the piety of a Muslim, Alláh will grant him Paradise." We asked, "If three persons testify his piety?" He (the Prophet) replied, "Even three." Then we asked, "If two?" He replied, "Even two." We did not ask him regarding one witness.

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "When a faithful believer is made to sit in his grave, then (the angels) come to him and he testifies that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and Muḥammad is Alláh's Apostle. And that corresponds to Alláh's statement: Alláh will keep firm those who believe with the word that stands firm . . . (14.27).

Alláh's Apostle said, "When (Alláh's) slave is put in his grave and his companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two angels come to him and make him sit and ask, 'What did you use to say about this man (i.e. Muḥammad)?' The faithful Believer will say, 'I testify that he is Alláh's slave and His Apostle.' Then they will say to him, 'Look at your place in the Hell Fire; Alláh has given you a place in Paradise instead of it.' So he will see both his places." (Qatada said, "We were informed that his grave would be made spacious." Then Qatada went back to the narration of Anas who said;) Whereas a hypocrite or a non-believer will be asked, "What did you use to say about this man." He will reply, "I do not know; but I used to say what the people used to say." So they will say to him, "Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the Qur’án)." Then he will be hit with iron hammers once, that he will send such a cry as everything near to him will hear, except Jinns and human beings. (See Ḥadít_h No. 422).

Narrated by Samura bin Jundab {#2:468 .italic}

Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, "Who amongst you had a dream last night?" So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: "Ma sha'a-llah" (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, 'What Alláh wished,' and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, "But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away. The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, 'Who is this?' They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, 'What is this?' They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children. Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), 'You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.' They said, 'Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection. The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Alláh had given the knowledge of Qur’án (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.' I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, 'That is your place.' I said, 'Let me enter my place.' They said, 'You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.' "

Aisha said, "I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, 'In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?' She replied, 'In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.' Abu Bakr further asked her, 'On which day did the Prophet die?' She replied, 'He died on Monday.' He asked, 'What is today?' She replied, 'Today is Monday.' He added, 'I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.' Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, 'Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.' I said, 'This is worn out.' He said, 'A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body's pus.' He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning."

During his sickness, Alláh's Apostle was asking repeatedly, "Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?" And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Alláh took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:472 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle in his fatal illness said, "Alláh cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets." And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet's grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship.

When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin ‘Abdu’l- Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I ('Urwa) said to them, "By Alláh, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of ‘Umar." Aisha narrated that she made a will to ‘Abdu’lláh bin Zubair, "Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet)."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi {#2:475 .italic}

I saw ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, "O ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,' and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions." (So, Ibn ‘Umar conveyed the message to 'Aisha.) She said, "I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (‘Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there)." When ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar returned, ‘Umar asked him, "What (news) do you have?" He replied, "O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there)." On that ‘Umar said, "Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her ('Aisha ) and say, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him," and then he mentioned the name of 'Uthman, ‘Alí, Talha, Az-Zubair, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas. By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, "O chief of the believers! Be happy with Alláh's glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this." ‘Umar replied, "O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Alláh and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities."

" Abu Bakr said, "By Alláh! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Alláh's orders) By Alláh! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Alláh's Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it" Then ‘Umar said, "By Alláh, it was nothing, but Alláh opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right."

The Prophet added, "One of their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front of them." The Prophet added, "I do not want anyone of you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say, 'O Muḥammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. 'I can't help you, for I conveyed Alláh's Message to you.' Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say "O Muḥammad! (please intercede for me)." I will say to him, "I can't help you for I conveyed Alláh's message to you."

I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met Abu Dhar and asked him, "What has brought you to this place?" He said, "I was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the Qur’án): 'They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Alláh.' (9.34). Muawiya said, 'This verse is revealed regarding the people of the scriptures." I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the scriptures." So we had a quarrel and Mu'awiya sent a complaint against me to 'Uthman. 'Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if they had not seen me before. So I told this to 'Uthman who said to me, "You may depart and live nearby if you wish." That was the reason for my being here for even if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him.

Narrated by Al-Ahnaf bin Qais {#2:489 .italic}

While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us and said, "Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting." After saying that, the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him, and I did not know who he was. I said to him, "I think the people disliked what you had said." He said, "These people do not understand anything, although my friend told me." I asked, "Who is your friend?" He said, "The Prophet said (to me), 'O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?' And on that I (Abu Dhar) started looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Alláh's Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, 'Yes!' He said, 'I do not love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Alláh's cause) except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth. No, by Alláh, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious advice till I meet Alláh, The Honorable, The Majestic." '

Narrated by Ibn Masud {#2:490 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "There is no envy except in two: a person whom Alláh has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and a person whom Alláh has given wisdom (i.e. religious knowledge) and he gives his decisions accordingly and teaches it to the others."

Narrated by Haritha bin Wahab {#2:492 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "O people! Give in charity as a time will come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be requested to take it) will say, "If you had brought it yesterday, would have taken it, but to-day I am not in need of it."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:493 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till your wealth increases so much so that one will be worried, for no one will accept his Zakat and the person to whom he will give it will reply, 'I am not in need of it.' "

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#2:494 .italic}

While I was sitting with Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) two person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained about the prevalence of robberies. Alláh's Apostle said, "As regards stealing and robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina) without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Alláh and there will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Alláh, and Alláh will ask him, 'Did not I give you wealth?' He will reply in the affirmative. Alláh will further ask, 'Didn't I send a messenger to you?' And again that person will reply in the affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if you do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant word (to your brethren). (See Ḥadít_h No. 793 Vol. 4).

Narrated by Abu Musa {#2:495 .italic}

Narrated by Abu Masud {#2:496 .italic}

When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they (the people) said, "He is showing off." And another man came and gave a sa (a small measure of food grains); they said, "Alláh is not in need of this small amount of charity." And then the Divine Inspiration came: "Those who criticize such of the believers who give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what is available to them." (9.79).

Narrated by Abu Masud Al-Ansar {#2:497 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered us to give in charity, we used to go to the market and work as porters and get a Mudd (a special measure of grain) and then give it in charity. (Those were the days of poverty) and to-day some of us have one hundred thousand.

A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for some alms), but she found nothing with me except one date which I gave to her and she divided it between her two daughters, and did not eat anything herself, and then she got up and went away. Then the Prophet came in and I informed him about this story. He said, "Whoever is put to trial by these daughters and he treats them generously (with benevolence) then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire." (See Ḥadít_h No. 24, Vol. 8).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:500 .italic}

A man came to the Prophet and asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Which charity is the most superior in reward?" He replied, "The charity which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, 'Give so much to such and such, and so much to such and such.' And it has already belonged to such and such (as it is too late)."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:501 .italic}

Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, "Who amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?" He said, "Whoever has the longest hand." So they started measuring their hands with a stick and Sauda's hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of all in the caliphate of ‘Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to practice charity. (Sauda died later in the caliphate of Muawiya).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:502 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "A man said that he would give something in charity. He went out with his object of charity and unknowingly gave it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he had given his object of charity to a thief. (On hearing that) he said, "O Alláh! All the praises are for you. I will give alms again." And so he again went out with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to an adulteress. Next morning the people said that he had given his alms to an adulteress last night. The man said, "O Alláh! All the praises are for you. (I gave my alms) to an adulteress. I will give alms again." So he went out with his alms again and (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. (The people) next morning said that he had given his alms to a wealthy person. He said, "O Alláh! All the praises are for you. (I had given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man." Then someone came and said to him, "The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from illegal sexual intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson from it and spend his wealth which Alláh has given him, in Alláh's cause."

Whatever you have taken is yours."

I said, 'A man's afflictions (wrong deeds) concerning his wife, children and neighbors are expiated by (his) prayers, charity, and enjoining good.' (The sub-narrator Sulaiman added that he said, 'The prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.') ‘Umar said, 'I did not mean that, but I ask about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I said, 'O chief of the believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.' He asked, 'Will the door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'No, it will be broken.' He said, 'Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed again?' I replied, 'Yes.' " Then we were afraid to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it. Hudhaifa said, "The door was ‘Umar. "We further asked Hudhaifa whether ‘Umar knew what that door meant. Hudhaifa replied in the affirmative and added, "He knew it as one knows that there will be a night before the tomorrow morning."

These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Alláh's Apostle had made obligatory for every Muslim, and which Alláh had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to seventy-five (camels), one Jadh'a is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but if the owner wants to pay he can.'

Narrated by Anas {#2:535 .italic}

Abu Bakr wrote to me what Alláh had ordered His Apostle (about Zakat) which goes: Neither an old nor a defected animal, nor a male-goat may be taken as Zakat except if the Zakat collector wishes (to take it).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:536 .italic}

Abu Bakr said, "By Alláh! If they (pay me the Zakat and) with-hold even a she-kid which they used to pay during the life-time of Alláh's Apostle, I will fight with them for it." ‘Umar said, "It was nothing but Alláh Who opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, and I came to know that his decision was right."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:537 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent Muadh to Yemen, he said (to him), "YOU are going to people of a (Divine) Book. First of all invite them to worship Alláh (alone) and when they come to know Alláh, inform them that Alláh has enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; and if they start offering these prayers, inform them that Alláh has enjoined on them, the Zakat. And it is to be taken from the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you in that, take Zakat from them and avoid (don't take) the best property of the people as Zakat."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#2:538 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "No Zakat is imposed on less than five Awsuq of dates; no Zakat is imposed on less than five Awaq of silver, and no Zakat is imposed on less than five camels."

Narrated by Abu Dhar {#2:539 .italic}

Once I went to him (the Prophet ) and he said, "By Alláh in Whose Hands my life is (or probably said, 'By Alláh, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped) whoever had camels or cows or sheep and did not pay their Zakat, those animals will be brought on the Day of Resurrection far bigger and fatter than before and they will tread him under their hooves, and will butt him with their horns, and (those animals will come in circle): When the last does its turn, the first will start again, and this punishment will go on till Alláh has finished the judgments amongst the people."

Narrated by Ishaq bin ‘Abdu’lláh bin Al Talha {#2:540 .italic}

I heard Anas bin Malik saying, "Abu Talha had more property of date-palm trees gardens than any other amongst the Ansar in Medina and the most beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and it was in front of the Mosque of the Prophet . Alláh's Apostle used to go there and used to drink its nice water." Anas added, "When these verses were revealed:--'By no means shall you Attain righteousness unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. ' (3.92) Abu Talha said to Alláh's Apostle 'O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt, Bairuha' garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Alláh's Cause. I expect its reward from Alláh. O Alláh's Apostle! Spend it where Alláh makes you think it feasible.' On that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Bravo! It is useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.' Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Alláh's Apostle.' Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#2:541 .italic}

On 'Id ul Fitr or 'Id ul Adha Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out to the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered the people to give alms. He said, "O people! Give alms." Then he went towards the women and said. "O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women)." The women asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is the reason for it?" He replied, "O women! You curse frequently, and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray." Then he left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Masud, came and asked permission to enter It was said, "O Alláh's Apostle! It is Zainab." He asked, 'Which Zainab?" The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas'ub. He said, "Yes, allow her to enter." And she was admitted. Then she said, "O Prophet of Alláh! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody else." The Prophet replied, "Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and your children had more right to it than anybody else."

Alláh's Apostle said, "There is no Zakat either on a horse or a slave belonging to a Muslim"

The Prophet said,"There is no Zakat either on a slave or on a horse belonging to a Muslim.

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#2:544 .italic}

Once the Prophet sat on a pulpit and we sat around him. Then he said, "The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which will be disclosed to you." Somebody said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Can the good bring forth evil?" The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person, "What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not talking to you." Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, "Where is the questioner?" It seemed as if the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, "Good never brings forth evil. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Al-Harith {#2:545 .italic}

Zainab, the wife of ‘Abdu’lláh said, "I was in the Mosque and saw the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saying, 'O women ! Give alms even from your ornaments.' " Zainab used to provide for ‘Abdu’lláh and those orphans who were under her protection. So she said to ‘Abdu’lláh, "Will you ask Alláh's Apostle whether it will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under my protection?" He replied "Will you yourself ask Alláh's Apostle ?" (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed by us and we asked him, 'Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my husband and the orphans under my protection.' And we requested Bilal not to inform the Prophet about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, "Who are those two?" Bilal replied that she was Zainab. The Prophet said, "Which Zainab?" Bilal said, "The wife of 'Adullah (bin Masud)." The Prophet said, "Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving Zakat."

Narrated by Zainab {#2:546 .italic}

(the daughter of Um Salama) My mother said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall I receive a reward if I spend for the sustenance of Abu Salama's offspring, and in fact they are also my sons?" The Prophet replied, "Spend on them and you will get a reward for what you spend on them."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:547 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered (a person) to collect Zakat, and that person returned and told him that Ibn Jamil, Khalid bin Al-Walid, and ‘Abbás bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib had refused to give Zakat." The Prophet said, "What made Ibn Jamll refuse to give Zakat though he was a poor man, and was made wealthy by Alláh and His Apostle ? But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping his armor for Alláh's Cause (for Jihad). As for ‘Abbás bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib, he is the uncle of Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and Zakat is compulsory on him and he should pay it double."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#2:548 .italic}

Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and he again gave them. And then they asked him and he gave them again till all that was with him finished. And then he said "If I had anything. I would not keep it away from you. (Remember) Whoever abstains from asking others, Alláh will make him contented, and whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Alláh will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Alláh will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater than patience."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:549 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is better for anyone of you to take a rope and cut the wood (from the forest) and carry it over his back and sell it (as a means of earning his living) rather than to ask a person for something and that person may give him or not."

Narrated by Az-Zubair bin Al'Awwam {#2:550 .italic}

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "It is better for anyone of you to take a rope (and cut) and bring a bundle of wood (from the forest) over his back and sell it and Alláh will save his face (from the Hell-Fire) because of that, rather than to ask the people who may give him or not."

Ḥakím bin Hizam said, "(Once) I asked Alláh's Apostle (for something) and he gave it to me. Again I asked and he gave (it to me). Again I asked and he gave (it to me). And then he said, "O Ḥakím! This property is like a sweet fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand." Ḥakím added, "I said to Alláh's Apostle , 'By Him (Alláh) Who sent you with the Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.' " Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Ḥakím to give him his share from the war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet ), he refused to accept anything. Then ‘Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that ‘Umar said, "O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Ḥakím his share from this booty and he refused to take it." So Ḥakím never took anything from anybody after the Prophet till he died.

Narrated by ‘Umar {#2:552 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to give me something but I would say to him, "would you give it to a poorer and more needy one than l?" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said to me, "Take it. If you are given something from this property, without asking for it or having greed for it take it; and if not given, do not run for it."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:553 .italic}

The Prophet said, "A man keeps on asking others for something till he comes on the Day of Resurrection without any piece of flesh on his face." The Prophet added, "On the Day of Resurrection, the Sun will come near (to, the people) to such an extent that the sweat will reach up to the middle of the ears, so, when all the people are in that state, they will ask Adam for help, and then Moses, and then Muḥammad (p.b.u.h) ." The sub-narrator added "Muḥammad will intercede with Alláh to judge amongst the people. He will proceed on till he will hold the ring of the door (of Paradise) and then Alláh will exalt him to Maqam Maḥmúd (the privilege of intercession, etc.). And all the people of the gathering will send their praises to Alláh.

The clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba narrated, "Muawiya wrote to Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba: Write to me something which you have heard from the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ." So Al-Mughira wrote: I heard the Prophet saying, "Alláh has hated for you three things: 1. Vain talks, (useless talk) that you talk too much or about others. 2. Wasting of wealth (by extravagance) 3. And asking too many questions (in disputed religious matters) or asking others for something (except in great need). (See Ḥadít_h No. 591, Vol. Ill)

Narrated by Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) {#2:556 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle distributed something (from the resources of Zakat) amongst a group of people while I was sitting amongst them, but he left a man whom I considered the best of the lot. So, I went up to Alláh's Apostle and asked him secretly, "Why have you left that person? By Alláh! I consider him a believer." The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim (Who surrender to Alláh)." I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Alláh! I consider him a believer. " The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim." I remained quiet for a while but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why have you left that person? By Alláh! I consider him a believer." The Prophet said, "Or merely a Muslim." Then Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, "I give to a person while another is dearer to me, for fear that he may be thrown in the Hell-fire on his face (by renegating from Islam)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:559 .italic}

We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and Alláh's Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa's) and 1 Sa'= 3 kg. approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, "Check what your garden will yield." When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, "There will be a strong wind to-night and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it." So we fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, "Ten Awsuq," and that was what Alláh's Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, "I want to reach Medina quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up." The sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina he said, "This is Taba." And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said, "This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the Ansar?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "The family of Bani-n-Najjar, and then the family of Bani Sa‘ída or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:562 .italic}

Dates used to be brought to Alláh's Apostle immediately after being plucked. Different persons would bring their dates till a big heap collected (in front of the Prophet). Once Al-Ḥasan and Al-Ḥusayn were playing with these dates. One of them took a date and put it in his mouth.

The Prophet said, "Do not take back what you have given in charity." For this reason, Ibn ‘Umar never purchased the things which he had given in charity, and in case he had purchased something (unknowingly) he would give it in charity again.

Narrated by ‘Umar {#2:567 .italic}

Once I gave a horse in Alláh's Cause (in charity) but that person did not take care of it. I intended to buy it, as I thought he would sell it at a low price. So, I asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h) about it. He said, "Neither buy, nor take back your alms which you have given, even if the seller were willing to sell it for one Dirham, for he who takes back his alms is like the one who swallows his own vomit."

And if they obey you in that tell them that Alláh has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them.

Al-Faḍl (his brother) was riding behind Alláh's Apostle and a woman from the tribe of Khath'am came and Al-Faḍl started looking at her and she started looking at him. The Prophet turned Al-Faḍl's face to the other side. The woman said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Alláh on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?" The Prophet replied, "Yes, you may." That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet ).

Narrated by Thumama bin ‘Abdu’lláh bin Anas {#2:592 .italic}

Anas performed the Hajj on a pack-saddle and he was not a miser. Anas said, "Alláh's Apostle performed Hajj on a pack-saddle and the same Mount was carrying his baggage too."

Narrated by Al-Qasim bin Muḥammad {#2:593 .italic}

'Aisha said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You performed 'Umra but I did not." He said, "O 'Abdur-Rahman! Go along with your sister and let her perform 'Umra from Tan'im." 'Abdur-Rahman made her ride over the pack-saddle of a she-camel and she performed 'Umra.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:594 .italic}

The Prophet was asked, "Which is the best deed?" He said, "To believe in Alláh and His Apostle." He was then asked, "Which is the next (in goodness)?" He said, "To participate in Jihad in Alláh's Cause." He was then asked, "Which is the next?" He said, "To perform Hajj-Mabrur. "

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:595 .italic}

(the mother of the faithful believers) I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We consider Jihad as the best deed." The Prophet said, "The best Jihad (for women) is Hajj Mabrur. "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:596 .italic}

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever performs Hajj for Alláh's pleasure and does not have sexual relations with his wife, and does not do evil or sins then he will return (after Hajj free from all sins) as if he were born anew."

Narrated by Zaid bin Jubair {#2:597 .italic}

I went to visit ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar at his house which contained many tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for Umra. He said, "Alláh's Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of Mawaqit) Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of Medina, and Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:598 .italic}

The people of Yemen used to come for Hajj and used not to bring enough provisions with them and used to say that they depend on Alláh. On their arrival in Medina they used to beg the people, and so Alláh revealed, "And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is the fear of Alláh." (2.197).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:599 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) made Dhul-Huiaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; Qarn-al-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these Mawaqit are for the people at those very places, and besides them for those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umra; and whoever is living within these boundaries can assume lhram from the place he starts, and the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca.

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:600 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'The people of Medina should assume lhram from Dhul-Hulaifa; the people of Sham from Al-Juhfa; and the people of Najd from Qarn." And ‘Abdu’lláh added, "I was informed that Alláh's Apostle had said, 'The people of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.' "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:601 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Mlqat for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; and Qarn Ul-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. So, these (above mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umra and whoever lives within these places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.

Narrated by Salim from his father who said, {#2:602 .italic}

"The Prophet had fixed the Mawaqit as follows: (No. 603)

Narrated by Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh from his father {#2:603 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "The Miqat for the people of Medina is Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and for the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn ‘Umar, "They claim, but I did not hear personally, that the Prophet said, "The Miqat for the people of Yemen is Yalamlam."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:604 .italic}

The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina, Al-Juhfa, for the people of Sham, Yalamlam for the people of Yemen, and Qarn for the people of Najd. And these Mawaqlt are for those living at those very places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; and whoever is living inside these places can assume lhram from his own dwelling place, and the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:605 .italic}

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina, Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham, Qarn-ul-Manazil for the people of Najd, and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these Mawaqit are for those living at those very places, and besides them for those whom come through them with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; and whoever is living within these Mawaqit should assume lhram from where he starts, and the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:606 .italic}

When these two towns (Basra and Kufa) were captured, the people went to ‘Umar and said, "O the Chief of the faithful believers! The Prophet fixed Qarn as the Miqat for the people of Najd, it is beyond our way and it is difficult for us to pass through it." He said, "Take as your Miqat a place situated opposite to Qarn on your usual way. So, he fixed Dhatu-Irq (as their Miqat)."

Narrated by Nafi {#2:607 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar' said, "Alláh's Apostle made his camel sit (i.e. he dismounted) at Al-Batha' in Dhul-Hulaifa and offered the prayer." ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar used to do the same.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:608 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to go (for Hajj) via Ash-Shajara way and return via Muarras way; and no doubt, whenever Alláh's Apostle went to Mecca, he used to offer the prayer in the Mosque of Ash-Shajara; and on his return, he used to offer the prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa in the middle of the valley, and pass the night there till morning.

Narrated by ‘Umar {#2:609 .italic}

In the valley of Al-'Aqiq I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "To night a messenger came to me from my Lord and asked me to pray in this blessed valley and to assume Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra together. "

Narrated by Musa bin 'Uqba {#2:610 .italic}

Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh's father said, "The Prophet said that while resting in the bottom of the valley at Mu'arras in Dhul-Hulaifa, he had been addressed in a dream: 'You are verily in a blessed valley.' " Salim made us to dismount from our camels at the place where ‘Abdu’lláh used to dismount, aiming at the place where Alláh's Apostle had rested and it was below the Mosque situated in the middle of the valley in between them (the residence) and the road.

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#2:611 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar used to oil his hair. I told that to Ibrahim who said, "What do you think about this statement: Narrated Aswad from 'Aisha: As if I were now observing the glitter of the scent in the parting of the hair of the Prophet while he was Muhrim?"

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:612 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) I used to scent Alláh's Apostle when he wanted to assume Ihram and also on finishing Ihram before the Tawaf round the Ka'ba (Tawaf-al-ifada).

Narrated by Salim from his father {#2:613 .italic}

I heard that Alláh's Apostle assumed Ihram with his hair matted together.

Narrated by Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:614 .italic}

I heard my father saying, "Never did Alláh's Apostle assume Ihram except at the Mosque, that is, at the Mosque of Dhul-Hulaifa.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:615 .italic}

A man asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What kind of clothes should a Muhrim wear?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "He should not wear a shirt, a turban, trousers, a headcloak or leather socks except if he can find no slippers, he then may wear leather socks after cutting off what might cover the ankles. And he should not wear clothes which are scented with saffron or Wars (kinds of Perfumes) . "

Narrated by 'Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:616 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás' said, "Usama rode behind Alláh's Apostle from 'Arafat to Al-Muzdalifa; and then Al-Faḍl rode behind Alláh's Apostle from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina." Ibn ‘Abbás added, "Both of them said, 'The Prophet kept on reciting Talbiya till he did the Rami of Jamrat-al-'Áqába.' "

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás {#2:617 .italic}

The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida', where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa'da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka'ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from 'Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#2:618 .italic}

The Prophet offered four Rakat in Medina and then two Rakat at DhulI lulaifa and then passed the night at Dhul-Hulaifa till it was morning and when he mounted his Mount and it stood up, he started to recite Talbiya.

Narrated by Abu Qilaba {#2:619 .italic}

Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet offered four Rakat of the Zuhr prayer in Medina and two Rakat of 'Asr prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa." I think that the Prophet passed the night there till morning.

Narrated by Anas {#2:620 .italic}

The Prophet offered four Rakat of the Zuhr prayer in Medina and two Rakat of the 'Asr prayer in Dhul-Hulaifa and I heard them (the companions of the Prophet) reciting Talbiya together loudly to the extent of shouting.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:621 .italic}

The Talbiya of Alláh's Apostle was : 'Labbaika Allahumma labbaik, Labbaika la sharika Laka labbaik, Inna-l-hamda wan-ni'mata Laka walmu Lk, La sharika Laka' (I respond to Your call O Alláh, I respond to Your call, and I am obedient to Your orders, You have no partner, I respond to Your call All the praises and blessings are for You, All the sovereignty is for You, And You have no partners with you.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:622 .italic}

I know how the Prophet used to say (Talbiya) and it was: 'Labbaika Allahumma Labbaik, Labbaika la sharika Laka labbaik, Inna-l-hamda wan-ni'mata Laka walmu Lk, La sharika Laka'.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#2:623 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle offered four Rakat of Zuhr prayer at Medina and we were in his company, and two Rakat of the Asr prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa and then passed the night there till it was dawn; then he rode, and when he reached Al-Baida', he praised and glorified Alláh and said Takbir (i.e. Alhamdu-lillah and Subhanallah(1) and Allahu-Akbar). Then he and the people along with him recited Talbiya with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra. When we reached (Mecca) he ordered us to finish the lhram (after performing the Umra) (only those who had no Hádí (animal for sacrifice) with them were asked to do so) till the day of Tarwiya that is 8th Dhul-Hijja when they assumed Ihram for Hajj. The Prophet sacrificed many camels (slaughtering them) with his own hands while standing. While Alláh's Apostle was in Medina he sacrificed two horned rams black and white in color in the Name of Alláh."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:624 .italic}

The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited Talbiya when he had mounted his Mount and was ready to set out.

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:625 .italic}

Whenever Ibn ‘Umar intended to go to Mecca he used to oil himself with a sort of oil that had no pleasant smell, then he would go to the Mosque of Al-Hulaita and offer the prayer, and then ride. When he mounted well on his Mount and the Mount stood up straight, he would proclaim the intention of assuming Ihram, and he used to say that he had seen the Prophet doing the same.

Narrated by Mujahid {#2:626 .italic}

I was in the company of Ibn ‘Abbás and the people talked about Ad-Dajjal and said, "Ad-Dajjal will come with the word Kafir (non-believer) written in between his eyes." On that Ibn ‘Abbás said, "I have not heard this from the Prophet but I heard him saying, 'As if I saw Moses just now entering the valley reciting Talbyia. ' "

Narrated by Aisha {#2:627 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, "Whoever has the Hádí with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with 'Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both." I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka'ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, "Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra." So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan'im. So I performed the 'Umra. The Prophet said to me, "This 'Umra is instead of your missed one." Those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).

Narrated by Ata {#2:628 .italic}

Jabir said, "The Prophet ordered ‘Alí to keep on assuming his Ihram." The narrator then informed about the narration of Suraqa.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#2:629 .italic}

‘Alí came to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) from Yemen (to Mecca). The Prophet asked ‘Alí, "With what intention have you assumed Ihram?" ‘Alí replied, "I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet." The Prophet said, "If I had not the Hádí with me I would have finished the Ihram." Muḥammad bin Bakr narrated extra from Ibn Juraij, "The Prophet said to ‘Alí, "With what intention have you assumed the Ihram, O ‘Alí?" He replied, "With the same (intention) as that of the Prophet." The Prophet said, "Have a Hádí and keep your Ihram as it is."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#2:630 .italic}

The Prophet sent me to some people in Yemen and when I returned, I found him at Al-Batha. He asked me, "With what intention have you assumed Ihram (i.e. for Hajj or for Umra or for both?") I replied, "I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of the Prophet." He asked, "Have you a Hádí with you?" I replied in the negative. He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when ‘Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, "If we follow Alláh's Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Alláh says: "Perform the Hajj and Umra for Alláh." (2.196). And if we follow the tradition of the Prophet who did not finish his Ihram till he sacrificed his Hádí."

Narrated by Al-Qasim bin Muḥammad {#2:631 .italic}

'Aisha said, "We set out with Alláh's Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, "Anyone who has not got the Hádí and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hádí should not finish the Ihram after performing ' Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, "The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hádí) finished their Ihram after Umra." Alláh's Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hádí with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, "Alláh's Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, "What makes you weep, O Hantah?" I replied, "I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra." He asked, "What is wrong with you?' I replied, ' I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).' He said, ' It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Alláh has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Alláh may reward you that." Aisha further added, "Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba." Aisha added, "I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him." He called ' Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, ' Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for ' Umra, and when you had finished ' Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.' " ' Aisha added, ' ' So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the ' Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, 'Have you performed the ' Umra?' We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.''

Narrated by Al-Aswad {#2:632 .italic}

'Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Kaba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hádí along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hádí along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet's wives, too, had not driven the Hádí with them, so they too, finished their Ihram." 'Aisha added, "I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba." So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and 'Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.' He said, 'Didn't you perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba the night we reached Mecca?' I replied in the negative. He said, 'Go with your brother to Tan'im and assume the Ihram for'Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.' On that Safiya said, 'I feel that I will detain you all.' The Prophet said, 'O 'Aqra Halqa! Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). 'There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.' " 'Aisha added, "(after returning from 'Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:633 .italic}

We set out with Alláh's Apostles (to Mecca) in the year of the Prophet's Last Hajj. Some of us had assumed Ihram for 'Umra only, some for both Hajj and 'Umra, and others for Hajj only. Alláh's Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and 'Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Ḥadít_h No. 631, 636, and 639).

Narrated by Marwan bin Al-Hakam {#2:634 .italic}

I saw 'Uthman and ‘Alí. 'Uthman used to forbid people to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu' and Hajj-al-Qiran (Hajj and 'Umra together), and when ‘Alí saw (this act of 'Uthman), he assumed Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra together saying, "Lubbaik for 'Umra and Hajj," and said, "I will not leave the tradition of the Prophet on the saying of somebody."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:635 .italic}

The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform 'Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, "When the wounds of the camel's back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) 'Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it." In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for'Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?" The Prophet replied, "Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything)."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#2:636 .italic}

I came to the Prophet (from Yemen and was assuming Ihram for Hajj) and he ordered me to finish the Ihram (after performing the 'Umra).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:637 .italic}

Hafsa the wife of the Prophet said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why have the people finished their Ihram after performing 'Umra but you have not finished your Ihram after performing 'Umra?" He replied, "I have matted my hair and garlanded my Hádí. So I will not finish my Ihram till I have slaughtered (my Hádí). "

Narrated by Shu'ba {#2:638 .italic}

Abu Jamra Nasr bin 'Imran Ad-Duba'i said, "I intended to perform Hajj-at-Tamattu' and the people advised me not to do so. I asked Ibn ‘Abbás regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at-Tammatu'. Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, 'Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet's tradition without committing sins and accepted by Alláh) and an accepted 'Umra.' So I told that dream to Ibn ‘Abbás. He said, 'This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.' Then he said to me, 'Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.' " I (Shu'ba) asked, "Why (did he invite you)?" He (Abu Jamra) said, "Because of the dream which I had seen."

Narrated by Abu Shihab {#2:639 .italic}

I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu' assuming Ihram for 'Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, "Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to 'Ata' asking him his view about it. He said, "Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh narrated to me, 'I performed Hajj with Alláh's Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka'ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for 'Umra only. They asked, 'How can we make it 'Umra (Tamattu') as we have intended to perform Hajj?' The Prophet said, 'Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hádí with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hádí reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).' So, they did (what he ordered them to do)."

Narrated by Said bin Al-Musaiyab {#2:640 .italic}

‘Alí and 'Uthman differed regarding Hajj-at-Tamattu' while they were at 'Usfan (a familiar place near Mecca). ‘Alí said, "I see you want to forbid people to do a thing that the Prophet did?" When ‘Alí saw that, he assumed Ihram for both Hajj and 'Umra.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:641 .italic}

We came with Alláh's Apostle (to Mecca) and we were saying: 'Labbaika Allahumma Labbaik' for Hajj. Alláh's Apostle ordered us to perform 'Umra with that Ihram (instead of Hajj).

(the wife of the Prophet) that Alláh's Apostle said to her, "Do you know that when your people (Quraish) rebuilt the Ka'ba, they decreased it from its original foundation laid by Abraham?" I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why don't you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?" He replied, "Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so." The sub-narrator, ‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Umar ) stated: 'Aisha 'must have heard this from Alláh's Apostle for in my opinion Alláh's Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka'ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka'ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:654 .italic}

I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka'ba) was part of the Ka'ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, "What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka'ba?" He said, "Don't you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka'ba)?" I asked, "What about its gate? Why is it so high?" He replied, "Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka'ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:655 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said to me, "Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, I would have demolished the Ka'ba and would have rebuilt it on its original foundations laid by Abraham (for Quraish had curtailed its building), and I would have built a back door (too)."

Narrated by Yazíd bin Ruman from 'Urwa {#2:656 .italic}

'Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, "O Aisha! Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka'ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham." That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka'ba. Jazz said, "I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka'ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka'ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka'ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels." So Jarir asked Yazíd, "Where was the place of those stones?" Jazz said, "I will just now show it to you." So Jarir accompanied Yazíd and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, "Here it is." Jarir said, "It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so."

Narrated by 'Usama bin Zaid {#2:658 .italic}

I asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Where will you stay in Mecca? Will you stay in your house in Mecca?" He replied, "Has 'Aqil left any property or house?" Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu Talib. Jafar and ‘Alí did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, "A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel." Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, "They (‘Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Alláh's Statement: "Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Alláh's Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another." (8.72)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#2:660 .italic}

On the Day of Nahr at Mina, the Prophet said, "Tomorrow we shall stay at Khaif Bani Kinana where the pagans had taken the oath of Kufr (heathenism)."

The people used to fast on 'Ashura (the tenth day of the month of Muharram) before the fasting of Ramaḍán was made obligatory. And on that day the Ka'ba used to be covered with a cover. When Alláh made the fasting of the month of Ramaḍán compulsory, Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever wishes to fast (on the day of 'Ashura') may do so; and whoever wishes to leave it can do so."

Narrated by Salim that his father said {#2:668 .italic}

"Alláh's Apostle, Usama bin Zaid, Bilal, and 'Uthman bin abu Talha entered the Ka'ba and then closed its door. When they opened the door I was the first person to enter (the Ka'ba). I met Bilal and asked him, "Did Alláh's Apostle offer a prayer inside (the Ka'ba)?" Bilal replied in the affirmative and said, "(The Prophet offered the prayer) in between the two right pillars."

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:669 .italic}

Whenever Ibn ‘Umar entered the Ka'ba he used to walk straight keeping the door at his back on entering, and used to proceed on till about three cubits from the wall in front of him, and then he would offer the prayer there aiming at the place where Alláh's Apostle prayed, as Bilal had told him. There is no harm for any person to offer the prayer at any place inside the Ka'ba.

Somebody asked ‘Abdu’lláh, "Did Alláh's Apostle enter the Ka'ba?" ‘Abdu’lláh replied in the negative.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:671 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle came to Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba with idols in it. He ordered (idols to be taken out). So they were taken out. The people took out the pictures of Abraham and Ishmael holding Azlams in their hands. Alláh's Apostle said, "May Alláh curse these people. By Alláh, both Abraham and Ishmael never did the game of chance with Azlams." Then he entered the Ka'ba and said Takbir at its corners but did not offer the prayer in it.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:672 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle and his companions came to Mecca, the pagans circulated the news that a group of people were coming to them and they had been weakened by the Fever of Yathrib (Medina). So the Prophet ordered his companions to do Ramal in the first three rounds of Tawaf of the Ka'ba and to walk between the two corners (The Black Stone and Yemenite corner). The Prophet did not order them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf out of pity for them.

Narrated by Salim that his father said {#2:673 .italic}

Had I not seen the Prophet touching (and kissing) you, I would never have touched (and kissed) you.' Then he kissed it and said, 'There is no reason for us to do Ramal (in Tawaf) except that we wanted to show off before the pagans, and now Alláh has destroyed them.' ‘Umar added, '(Nevertheless), the Prophet did that and we do not want to leave it (i.e. Ramal).'

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:676 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar. said, "I have never missed the touching of these two stones of Ka'ba (the Black Stone and the Yemenite Corner) both in the presence and the absence of crowds, since I saw the Prophet touching them." I asked Nafi': "Did Ibn ‘Umar use to walk between the two Corners?" Nafi' replied, "He used to walk in order that it might be easy for him to touch it (the Corner Stone)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:677 .italic}

I saw Alláh's Apostle touching and kissing it."

'Aisha said, "The first thing the Prophet did on reaching Mecca, was the ablution and then he performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and that was not 'Umra (alone), (but Hajj-al-Qiran). 'Urwa added: Later Abu Bakr and ‘Umar did the same in their Hajj." And I performed the Hajj with my father Az-Zubair, and the first thing he did was Tawaf of the Ka'ba. Later I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and the Ansar doing the same. My mother (Asmá’) told me that she, her sister ('Aisha), Az-Zubair and such and such persons assumed Ihram for 'Umra, and after they passed their hands over the Black Stone Corner (of the Ka'ba) they finished the Ihram. (i.e. After doing Tawaf of the Ka'ba and Sa'i between Safa-Marwa.

(See Ḥadít_h No. 365 Vol. 1)

Narrated by Amr {#2:690 .italic}

We asked Ibn ‘Umar: "May a man have sexual relations with his wife during the Umra before performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?" He said, "Alláh's Apostle arrived (in Mecca) and circumambulated the Kaba seven times, then offered two Rakat behind Maqam Ibrahim (the station of Abraham), then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." Ibn ‘Umar added, "Verily! In Alláh's Apostle you have a good example."

Alláh's Apostle came to the drinking place and asked for water. Al-‘Abbás said, "O Faḍl! Go to your mother and bring water from her for Alláh's Apostle ." Alláh's Apostle said, "Give me water to drink." Al-‘Abbás said, "O Alláhs Apostle! The people put their hands in it." Alláh's Apostle again said, 'Give me water to drink. So, he drank from that water and then went to the Zam-zam (well) and there the people were offering water to the others and working at it (drawing water from the well). The Prophet then said to them, "Carry on! You are doing a good deed." Then he said, "Were I not afraid that other people would compete with you (in drawing water from Zam-zam), I would certainly take the rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water)."

We set out with Alláh's Apostle in the year of his Last Hajj and we mended (the Ihram) for 'Umra. Then the Prophet said, "Whoever has a Hádí with him should assume Ihram for both Hajj and 'Umra, and should not finish it till he performs both of the them (Hajj and 'Umra)." When we reached Mecca, I had my menses. When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with 'Abdur-Rahman to Tan'im and I performed the 'Umra. The Prophet said, "This is in lieu of your missed 'Umra." Those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina. And those who had assumed lhram for Hajj and 'Umra to get her ( Hajj-Qiran ) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar and his riding animal entered the house of Ibn ‘Umar. He (the son of Ibn ‘Umar) said, "I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka'ba. I suggest that you should stay here." Ibn ‘Umar said, "Once Alláh's Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka'ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka'ba, I would do the same as Alláh's Apostle had done . . . "Verily, in Alláh's Apostle you have a good example." Then he added, "I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with 'Umra." After arriving at Mecca, Ibn ‘Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:704 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn ‘Umar, "There is a danger of an impending war between them." Ibn ‘Umar said, "Verily, in Alláh's Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Alláh's Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform 'Umra." Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida', he said, "The ceremonies of both Hajj and 'Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with 'Umra." He drove (to Mecca) a Hádí which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hádí or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hádí and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and 'Umra. Ibn ‘Umar said, "Alláh's Apostle did the same."

Narrated by Muḥammad bin 'AbdurRahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi {#2:705 .italic}

I asked 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). 'Urwa replied, "Aisha narrated, 'When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and his intention was not 'Umra alone (but Hajj and 'Umra together).' " Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka'ba and it was not 'Umra alone (but Hajj and 'Umra together). And then ‘Umar did the same. Then 'Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka'ba and it was not 'Umra alone. And then Muawiya and ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka'ba and it was not 'Umra alone, (but Hajj and 'Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not 'Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn ‘Umar, and he did not do another 'Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn ‘Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka'ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for 'Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram."

Narrated by 'Urwa {#2:706 .italic}

I asked 'Aisha : "How do you interpret the statement of Alláh,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Alláh, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka'ba or performs 'Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Alláh! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." 'Aisha said, "O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Alláh should have been, 'It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.' But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called "Manat" which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When they embraced Islam, they asked Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." So Alláh revealed: 'Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Alláh.' " Aisha added, "Surely, Alláh's Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them." Later on I ('Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin 'Abdur-Rahman (of 'Aisha's narration) and he said, 'i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom 'Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. When Alláh referred to the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Qur’án, the people asked, 'O Alláh's Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Alláh has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka'ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?' So Alláh revealed: "Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Alláh." Abu Bakr said, "It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Alláh had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka'ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka'ba.'

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:707 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar said, "When Alláh's Apostle performed the first Tawaf he did Ramal in the first three rounds and then walked in the remaining four rounds (of Tawaf of the Ka'ba), where as in performing Tawaf between Safa and Marwa he used to run in the midst of the rain-water passage," I asked Nafi', "Did ‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Umar) use to walk steadily on reaching the Yemenite Corner?" He replied, "No, unless people were crowded at the Corner; otherwise he would not leave it without touching it."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Dinar {#2:708 .italic}

We asked Ibn ‘Umar whether a man who, while performing 'Umra, had performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba; and had not yet performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, could have sexual relation with his wife, Ibn ‘Umar replied "The Prophet (p.b.u.h) reached Mecca and performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) of the Ka'ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer behind Maqam ibrahim and then performed the seven rounds (of Tawaf) between Safa and Marwa." He added, "Verily! In Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example." We asked Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh (the same question) and he said, "He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Dinar {#2:709 .italic}

I heard Ibn ‘Umar saying, "The Prophet arrived at Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and then offered a two-Rakat prayer and then performed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa." Ibn ‘Umar then recited (the verse): "Verily! In Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example. "

Narrated by 'Asim {#2:710 .italic}

I asked Anas bin Malik: "Did you use to dislike to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?" He said, "Yes, as it was of the ceremonies of the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, till Alláh revealed: 'Verily! (The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Alláh. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka'ba, or performs 'Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.' " (2.158)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:711 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and the Sa'i of Safa and Marwa so as to show his strength to the pagans.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:712 .italic}

I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Alláh's Apostle about it. He replied, "Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba till you get clean (from your menses)."

The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hádí (sacrifice) with them. ‘Alí arrived from Yemen and had a Hádí with him. ‘Alí said, "I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done." The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the 'Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka'ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hádí with them. They (the people) said, "How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?" When that news reached the Prophet he said, "If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hádí with me. Had there been no Hádí with me, I would have finished the state of lhram." 'Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka'ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba. She said, "O Alláh's Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and 'Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only." So the Prophet ordered 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan'im and thus she performed the 'Umra after the Hajj.

Narrated by Hafsa {#2:714 .italic}

(On 'Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for 'Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Alláh's Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Alláh's Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, "We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients." She (her sister) asked Alláh's Apostle , "Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn't have a veil?" He said, "She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers." When Um 'Atiyya came, I asked her. "Did you hear anything about that?" Um 'Atiyya said, "Bi Abi" and she never mentioned the name of Alláh's Apostle without saying "Bi Abi" (i.e. 'Let my father be sacrificed for you'). We asked her, "Have you heard Alláh's Apostle saying so and so (about women)?" She replied in the affirmative and said, "Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place)." I asked her, "The menstruating women?" She replied, "Don't they present themselves at 'Arafat and at such and such places?"

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz bin Rufai {#2:715 .italic}

I asked Anas bin Malik, "Tell me what you remember from Alláh's Apostle (regarding these questions): Where did he offer the Zuhr and 'Asr prayers on the day of Tarwiya (8th day of Dhul-Hajja)?" He relied, "(He offered these prayers) at Mina." I asked, "Where did he offer the 'Asr prayer on the day of Nafr (i.e. departure from Mina on the 12th or 13th of Dhul-Hijja)?" He replied, "At Al-Abtah," and then added, "You should do as your chiefs do."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz {#2:716 .italic}

I went out to Mina on the day of Tarwiya and met Anas going on a donkey. I asked him, "Where did the Prophet offer the Zuhr prayer on this day?" Anas replied, "See where your chiefs pray and pray similarly."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:717 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle offered a two-Rakat prayer at Mina. Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and 'Uthman, (during the early years of his caliphate) followed the same practice.

Narrated by Haritha bin Wahab Al-Khuza'i {#2:718 .italic}

The Prophet led us in a two-Rakat prayer at Mina although our number was more than ever and we were in better security than ever.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Masud {#2:719 .italic}

I offered (only a) two Rakat prayer with the Prophet (at Mina), and similarly with Abu Bakr and with ‘Umar, and then you d offered in opinions. Wish that I would be lucky enough to have two of the four Rakat accepted (by Alláh).

Narrated by Um Al-Faḍl {#2:720 .italic}

The people doubted whether the Prophet was observing the fast on the Day of 'Arafat, so I sent something for him to drink and he drank it.

Narrated by Muḥammad bin Abu Bakr Al-Thaqafi {#2:721 .italic}

I asked Anas bin Malik while we were proceeding from Mina to 'Arafat, "What do you use to do on this day when you were with Alláh's Apostle ?" Anas said, "Some of us used to recite Talbiya and nobody objected to that, and others used to recite Takbir and nobody objected to that."

Narrated by Salim {#2:722 .italic}

‘Abdu’l- Malik wrote to Al-Hajjaj that he should not differ from Ibn ‘Umar during Hajj. On the Day of 'Arafat, when the sun declined at midday, Ibn ‘Umar came along with me and shouted near Al-Hajjaj's cotton (cloth) tent. Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, "O Abu Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?" He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to 'Arafat)." Al-Hajjaj asked, "At this very hour?" Ibn ‘Umar said, "Yes." He replied, "Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out." Then Ibn ‘Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn ‘Umar). I said to him, "If you want to follow the Sunna then deliver a brief sermon and hurry up for the stay at 'Arafat." He started looking at ‘Abdu’lláh (Ibn ‘Umar) (inquiringly), and when ‘Abdu’lláh noticed that, he said that he had told the truth.

Narrated by Um Al-Faḍl bint Al Harith {#2:723 .italic}

On the day of 'Arafat, some people who were with me, differed about the fasting of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) some said that he was fasting while others said that he was not fasting. So I sent a bowl full of milk to him while he was riding his camel, and he drank that milk.

Narrated by Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#2:724 .italic}

‘Abdu’l-Malik bin Marwan wrote to Al-Hajjaj that he should follow ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar in all the ceremonies of Hajj. So when it was the Day of 'Arafat (9th of Dhul-Hajja), and after the sun has deviated or has declined from the middle of the sky, I and Ibn ‘Umar came and he shouted near the cotton (cloth) tent of Al-Hajjaj, "Where is he?" Al-Hajjaj came out. Ibn ‘Umar said, "Let us proceed (to 'Arafat)." Al-Hajjaj asked, "Just now?" Ibn ‘Umar replied, "Yes." Al-Hajjaj said, "Wait for me till I pour water on me (i.e. take a bath)." So, Ibn ‘Umar dismounted (and waited) till Al-Hajjaj came out. He was walking between me and my father. I informed Al-Hajjaj, "If you want to follow the Sunna today, then you should shorten the sermon and then hurry up for the stay (at 'Arafat)." Ibn ‘Umar said, "He (Salim) has spoken the truth."

Narrated by Muḥammad bin Jubair bin Mut'im {#2:725 .italic}

My father said, "(Before Islam) I was looking for my camel .." The same narration is told by a different sub-narrator. Jubair bin Mut'im said, "My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of 'Arafat, and I saw the Prophet standing in 'Arafat. I said to myself: By Alláh he is from the Hums (literally: strictly religious, Quraish were called so, as they used to say, 'We are the people of Alláh we shall not go out of the sanctuary). What has brought him here?"

Narrated by 'Urwa {#2:726 .italic}

During the pre-lslamic period of Ignorance, the people used to perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba naked except the Hums; and the Hums were Quraish and their offspring. The Hums used to give clothes to the men who would perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to give clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. Those to whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round the Ka'ba naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) directly from 'Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at Al-Muzdalifa. 'Urwa added, "My father narrated that 'Aisha had said, 'The following verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from the place whence all the people depart--(2.199) 'Urwa added, "They (the Hums) used to stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there (to Mina) and so they were sent to 'Arafat (by Alláh's order)."

Narrated by 'Urwa {#2:727 .italic}

Usama was asked in my presence, "How was the speed of (the camel of) Alláh's Apostle while departing from 'Arafat during the Hajjatul Wada?" Usama replied, "The Prophet proceeded on with a modest pace, and when there was enough space he would (make his camel) go very fast."

Narrated by Usama bin Zaid {#2:728 .italic}

As soon as the Prophet departed from 'Arafat, he went towards the mountain pass, and there he answered the call of) the prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Will you offer the prayer here?" He replied, "(The place of) the prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)."

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:729 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar used to offer the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers together at Jam' (Al-Muzdalifa). But he used to pass by that mountain pass where Alláh's Apostle went, and he would enter it and answer the call of nature and perform ablution, and would not offer any prayer till he had prayed at Jam.'

Narrated by Usama bin Zaid {#2:730 .italic}

Rode behind Alláh's Apostle from 'Arafat and when Alláh's Apostle reached the mountain pass on the left side which is before Al-Muzdalifa he made his camel kneel and then urinated, and then I poured water for his ablution. He performed light ablution and then I said to him: (Is it the time for) the prayer, O Alláh's Apostle!" He replied, "The (place of) prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)." So Alláh's Apostle rode till he reached Al-Muzdalifa and then he offered the prayer (there) . Then in the morning (10th Dhul-Hijja) Al-Faql (bin ‘Abbás) rode behind Alláh's Apostle. Kuraib, (a sub-narrator) said that ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás narrated from Al-Faḍl, "Alláh's Apostle (p.b.u.h) kept on reciting Talbiya (during the journey) till he reached the Jamra." (Jamrat-al-Áqába)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás. {#2:731 .italic}

I proceeded along with the Prophet on the day of 'Arafat (9th Dhul-Hijja). The Prophet heard a great hue and cry and the beating of camels behind him. So he beckoned to the people with his lash, "O people! Be quiet. Hastening is not a sign of righteousness."

Narrated by Usama bin Zaid {#2:732 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle proceeded from 'Arafat and dismounted at the mountainous pass and then urinated and performed a light ablution. I said to him, "(Shall we offer) the prayer?" He replied, "The prayer is ahead of you (i.e. at Al-Muzdalifa)." When he came to Al-Muzdalifa, he performed a perfect ablution. Then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offended the Maghrib prayer and then every person made his camel kneel at his place; and then Iqama for the prayer was pronounced and he offered the ('Isha') prayer and he did not offer any prayer in between them (i.e. Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:733 .italic}

The Prophet offered the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers together at Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) with a separate Iqama for each of them and did not offer any optional prayer in between them or after each of them.

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Yazíd {#2:735 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh;- performed the Hajj and we reached Al-Muzdalifa at or about the time of the 'Isha' prayer. He ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama and then he offered the Maghrib prayer and offered two Rakat after it. Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the 'isha' prayer). ('Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement 'I think', was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by 'Abdu-Rahman). Then ‘Abdu’lláh offered two Rakat of 'Isha' prayer. When the day dawned, ‘Abdu’lláh said, "The Prophet never offered any prayer at this hour except this prayer at this time and at this place and on this day." ‘Abdu’lláh added, "These two prayers are shifted from their actual times -- the Maghrib prayer (is offered) when the people reached Al-Muzdalifa and the Fajr (morning) prayer at the early dawn." ‘Abdu’lláh added, "I saw the Prophet doing that."

Narrated by Salim {#2:736 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar used to send the weak among his family early to Mina. So they used to depart from Al-Mash'ar Al-Haram (that is Al-Muzdalifa) at night (when the moon had set) and invoke Alláh as much as they could, and then they would return (to Mina) before the Imam had started from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina. So some of them would reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Áqába) Ibn ‘Umar used to say, "Alláh's Apostle gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:737 .italic}

(the slave of Asmá’) During the night of Jam', Asmá’ got down at Al-Muzdalifa and stood up for (offering) the prayer and offered the prayer for some time and then asked, "O my son! Has the moon set?" I replied in the negative and she again prayed for another period and then asked, "Has the moon set?" I replied, "Yes." So she said that we should set out (for Mina), and we departed and went on till she threw pebbles at the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Áqába) and then she returned to her dwelling place and offered the morning prayer. I asked her, "O you! I think we have come (to Mina) early in the night." She replied, "O my son! Alláh's Apostle gave permission to the women to do so."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:740 .italic}

Sauda asked the permission of the Prophet to leave earlier at the night of Jam', and she was a fat and very slow woman. The Prophet gave her permission.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:741 .italic}

We got down at Al-Muzdalifa and Sauda asked the permission of the Prophet to leave (early) before the rush of the people. She was a slow woman and he gave her permission, so she departed (from Al-Muzdalifa) before the rush of the people. We kept on staying at Al-Muzdalifa till dawn, and set out with the Prophet but (I suffered so much that) I wished I had taken the permission of Alláh's Apostle as Sauda had done, and that would have been dearer to me than any other happiness.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#2:742 .italic}

I never saw the Prophet offering any prayer not at its stated time except two; he prayed the Maghrib and the 'Isha' together and he offered the morning prayer before its usual time.

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Yazíd {#2:743 .italic}

I went out with ‘Abdu’lláh , to Mecca and when we proceeded to am' he offered the two prayers (the Maghrib and the 'Isha') together, making the Adhan and Iqama separately for each prayer. He took his supper in between the two prayers. He offered the Fajr prayer as soon as the day dawned. Some people said, "The day had dawned (at the time of the prayer)," and others said, "The day had not dawned." ‘Abdu’lláh then said, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'These two prayers have been shifted from their stated times at this place only (at Al-Muzdalifa); first: The Maghrib and the 'Isha'. So the people should not arrive at Al-Muzdalifa till the time of the 'Isha' prayer has become due. The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.' " Then ‘Abdu’lláh stayed there till it became a bit brighter. He then said, "If the chief of the believers hastened onwards to Mina just now, then he had indeed followed the Sunna." I do not know which proceeded the other, his (‘Abdu’lláh's) statement or the departure of 'Uthman . ‘Abdu’lláh was reciting Talbiya till he threw pebbles at the Jamrat-al-'Áqába on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering) (that is the 10th of Dhul-Hijja).

Narrated by 'Amr bin Maimun {#2:744 .italic}

I saw ‘Umar, offering the Fajr (morning) prayer at Jam'; then he got up and said, "The pagans did not use to depart (from Jam') till the sun had risen, and they used to say, 'Let the sun shine on Thabir (a mountain).' But the Prophet contradicted them and departed from Jam' before sunrise."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:745 .italic}

The Prophet made Al-Faql ride behind him, and Al-Faḍl informed that he (the Prophet ) kept on reciting Talbiya till he did the Rami of the Jamra. (Jamrat-al-Áqába.)

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Usama bin Zaid rode behind the Prophet from 'Arafat to Al-Muzdalifa; and then from Al-Muzdalifa to Mina, Al-Faḍl rode behind him." He added, "Both of them (Usama and Al-Faḍl) said, 'The Prophet was constantly reciting Talbiya till he did Rami of the Jamarat-al-'Áqába."

Narrated by Abu Jamra {#2:747 .italic}

I asked Ibn ‘Abbás about Hajj-at-Tamattu'. He ordered me to perform it. I asked him about the Hádí (sacrifice). He said, "You have to slaughter a camel, a cow or a sheep, or you may share the Hádí with the others." It seemed that some people disliked it (Hajj-at-Tamattu). I slept and dreamt as if a person was announcing: "Hajj Mabrur and accepted Mut'ah (Hajj-At-Tamattu')" I went to Ibn ‘Abbás and narrated it to him. He said, "Alláh is Greater. (That was) the tradition of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. Prophet). Narrated Shu'ba that the call in the dream was. "An accepted 'Umra and Hajj-Mabrur. "

The Prophet said, "Ride on it." And on the second or the third time he (the Prophet ) added, "Woe to you."

Narrated by Anas {#2:749 .italic}

The Prophet saw a man driving a Badana. He said, "Ride on it." The man replied, "It is a Badana." The Prophet said (again), "Ride on it." He (the man) said, "It is a Badana." The Prophet said thrice, "Ride on it."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#2:750 .italic}

During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada') of Alláh's Apostle he performed 'Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hádí along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Alláh's Apostle started by assuming Ihram for'Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the 'Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hádí and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, "Whoever among you has driven the Hádí, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hádí with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hádí (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hádí, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka'ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka'ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hádí on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hádí with them did the same as Alláh's Apostle did.

Narrated by Nafi' {#2:751 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Abdu’lláh) bin ‘Umar said to his father, "Stay here, for I am afraid that it (affliction between Ibn Zubair and Al-Hajjaj) might prevent you from reaching the Ka'ba." Ibn ‘Umar said, "(In this case) I would do the same as Alláh's Apostle did, and Alláh has said, 'Verily, in Alláh's Apostle, you have a good example (to follow).' So, I make you, people, witness that I have made 'Umra compulsory for me." So he assumed lhram for'Umra. Then he went out and when he reached Al-Baida', he assumed Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra (together) and said, "The conditions (requisites) of Hajj and 'Umra are the same." He, then brought a Hádí from Qudaid. Then he arrived (at Mecca) and performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) once for both Hajj and 'Umra and did not finish the lhram till he had finished both Hajj and 'Umra.

He replied, "Verily, in Alláh's Apostle there is a good example for you (to follow). In this case I would do the same as he had done. I make you witness that I have intended to perform 'Umra." When he reached Al-Baida', he said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra are the same. I make you witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with 'Umra." After that he took a garlanded Hádí (to Mecca) which he bought (on the way). When he reached (Mecca), he performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and of Safa (and Marwa) and did not do more than that. He did not make legal for himself the things which were illegal for a Muhrim till it was the Day of Nahr (sacrifice), when he had his head shaved and slaughtered (the sacrifice) and considered sufficient his first Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa), as a (Sa'i) for his Hajj and 'Umra both. He then said, "The Prophet used to do like that."

He went down the middle of the valley, and when he came near the tree (which was near the Jamra) he stood opposite to it and threw seven small pebbles and said: 'Allahu-Akbar' on throwing every pebble.' Then he said, 'By Him, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, here (at this place) stood the one on whom Surat-al-Baqra was revealed (i.e. Alláh's Apostle).' "

Narrated by 'Ikrima {#2:813 .italic}

The people of Medina asked Ibn ‘Abbás about a woman who got her menses after performing Tawaf-al-Ifada. He said, "She could depart (from Mecca)." They said, "We will not act on your verdict and ignore the verdict of Zaid." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "When you reach Medina, inquire about it." So, when they reached Medina they asked (about that). One of those whom they asked was Um Sulaim. She told them the narration of Safiya (812).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#2:814 .italic}

A menstruating woman was allowed to leave Mecca if she had done Tawaf-al-Ifada. Tawus (a sub-narrator) said from his father, "I heard Ibn ‘Umar saying that she would not depart. Then later I heard him saying that the Prophet had allowed them (menstruating women) to depart."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:815 .italic}

We set out with the Prophet with the intention of performing Hajj only. The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hádí with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hádí with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and 'Umra except me." He asked me, "Didn't you perform Tawaf of the Ka'ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?" I said, "No." He said, "Go to Tan'im with your brother 'Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for 'Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place." So I went with 'Abdur-Rahman to Tan'im and assumed Ihram for 'Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, " 'Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn't you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?" She said, "Yes, I did." He said, "Then there is no harm, depart." So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa.

He replied, "At Al-Abtah," and added, "You should do as your leaders do."

Staying at Al-Mahassab is not one of the ceremonies (of Hajj), but Al-Mahassab is a place where Alláh's Apostle camped (during his Hajjat-ul-wida).

Narrated by Nafi {#2:820 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar used to spend the night at Dhi-Tuwa in between the two Thaniyas and then he would enter Mecca through the Thaniya which is at the higher region of Mecca, and whenever he came to Mecca for Hajj or 'Umra, he never made his she camel kneel down except near the gate of the Masjid (Sacred Mosque) and then he would enter (it) and go to the Black (stone) Corner and start from there circumambulating the Ka'ba seven times: hastening in the first three rounds (Ramal) and walking in the last four. On finishing, he would offer two Rakat prayer and set out to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa before returning to his dwelling place. On returning (to Medina) from Hajj or 'Umra, he used to make his camel kneel down at Al-Batha which is at Dhu-l-Hulaifa, the place where the Prophet used to make his camel kneel down.

Narrated by Khalid bin Al-Harith {#2:821 .italic}

'Ubaidullah was asked about Al Mahassab. 'Ubaidullah narrated: Nafi' said, 'Alláh's Apostles, ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Umar camped there." Nafi' added, "Ibn ‘Umar used to offer the Zuhr and 'Asr prayers at it (i.e. Al-Mahassab)." I think he mentioned the Maghrib prayer also. I said, "I don't doubt about 'Isha' (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and he used to sleep there for a while. He used to say, 'The Prophet used to do the same.' "

Narrated by 'Aisha {#2:823 .italic}

Safiya got her menses on the night of Nafr (departure from Hajj), and she said, "I see that I will detain you." The Prophet said, "Aqra Halqa! Did she perform the Tawaf on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?" Somebody replied in the affirmative. He said, "Then depart." (Different narrators mentioned that) 'Aisha said, "We set out with Alláh's Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her menses. The Prophet said, "Halqa Aqra! I think that she will detain you," and added, "Did you perform the Tawaf (Al-Ifada) on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?" She replied, "Yes." He said, "Then depart." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle!

Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He replied, 'Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab." We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard 'Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. 'Ursa said, "O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don't you hear what Abu 'Abdur Rahman is saying?" She said, "What does he say?" 'Ursa said, "He says that Alláh's Apostle performed four 'Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab." 'Aisha said, "May Alláh be merciful to Abu 'Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any 'Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any 'Umra in Rajab."

I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed 'Umra. He replied, "Four times. 1. 'Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa'da when the pagans hindered him; 2. 'Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa'da after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. 'Umra from Al-Jr'rana where he distributed the war booty." I think he meant the booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, "How many times did he perform Hajj?" He (Anas) replied, "Once. "

Narrated by Qatada {#3:7 .italic}

I asked Anas (about the Prophet's 'Umra) and he replied, "The Prophet performed 'Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another 'Umra in Dhi-l-Qa'da, and another 'Umra in combination with his Hajj."

Narrated by Hammam {#3:8 .italic}

The Prophet performed four 'Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa'da except the (one) 'Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His 'Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al-Jr'rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another 'Umra with his Hajj.

Narrated by Abu Ishaq {#3:9 .italic}

I asked Masruq, 'Ata' and Mujahid (about the 'Umra of Alláh's Apostle). They said, "Alláh's Apostle had performed 'Umra in Dhi-l-Qa'da before he performed Hajj." I heard Al-Bara' bin 'Azib saying, "Alláh's Apostle had performed 'Umra in Dhi-l-Qa'da twice before he performed Hajj."

I heard Ibn ‘Abbás saying, "Alláh's Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn ‘Abbás named her but 'Ata' forgot her name), 'What prevented you from performing Hajj with us?' She replied, 'We have a camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and left one camel for us to use for irrigation.' He said (to her), 'Perform 'Umra when Ramaḍán comes, for 'Umra in Ramaḍán is equal to Hajj (in reward),' or said something similar."

Narrated by Aisha {#3:11 .italic}

We set out along with Alláh's Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, "Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for 'Umra may do so. Hadn't I brought the Hádí (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for 'Umra." ('Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for 'Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for 'Umra. The day of 'Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, "Abandon your 'Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;." When it was the night of Hasba, he sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan'im and I assumed Ihram for 'Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed 'Umra.

‘Abdu’l- Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let 'Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform 'Umra from At-Tan'im.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#3:13 .italic}

The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hádí with them. ‘Alí had come from Yemen and he had the Hádí with him. He (‘Alí) said, "I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Alláh's Apostle has assumed it." The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for 'Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hádí with them. They asked, "Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?" The Prophet heard that and said, "Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hádí. If I did not have the Hádí with me I would have finished my Ihram." 'Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, she said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and 'Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!" So, he ordered 'Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan'im. Thus she performed 'Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham met the Prophet at Al-'Áqába (Jamrat-ul 'Áqába) while the latter was stoning it and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?" The Prophet replied, "No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform 'Umra before Hajj."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:14 .italic}

We set out with Alláh's Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, "Whoever wants to assume Ihram for 'Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hádí with me, I would have assumed Ihram for 'Umra." Some of the people assumed Ihram for 'Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for 'Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of 'Arafat. I complained to Alláh's Apostle about it, he said, "Abandon your 'Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj." So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent 'Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim. The sub-narrator adds: He ('AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for 'Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and 'Umra, and no Hádí, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her.

Narrated by Al-Aswad {#3:15 .italic}

That 'Aisha said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and 'Umra) but I am returning with one only?" He said, "Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to At-Tan'im, assume Ihram (and after performing 'Umra) join us at such-and-such a place. But it (i.e. the reward if 'Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it)."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:16 .italic}

We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, "Whoever has not got the Hádí with him and likes to make it as 'Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hádí with him should not do it." The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hádí with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the 'Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, "I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the 'Umra." He asked me, "What is the matter with you?" I replied, "I am not praying." He said, "There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Alláh will enable you to perform the 'Umra as well." So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called 'Abdur-Rahman and said, "Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for 'Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place." We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, "Have you finished?" I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka'ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina.

Narrated by Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya from his father who said {#3:17 .italic}

"A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji'rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), 'What do you order me to perform in my 'Umra?' So, Alláh inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. ‘Umar said to me, 'Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Alláh is inspiring him?' I replied in the affirmative. ‘Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, "Where is the questioner who asked about 'Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka'ba and the Sa'i between Safa and Marwa). "

Narrated by Hisham Ibn 'Urwa from his father who said {#3:18 .italic}

While I was a youngster, I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet. "What about the meaning of the Statement of Alláh; "Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Alláh. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or 'Umra of the House (Ka'ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them." 'Aisha replied, "No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: 'It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.' This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Alláh's Apostle about that, and Alláh revealed:-- "Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Alláh. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or 'Umra of the House (Ka'ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them." (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from 'Aisha): "The Hajj or 'Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Alláh's sight.

Narrated by Ismá’íl {#3:19 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Aufa said: "Alláh's Apostle performed 'Umra and we too performed 'Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka'ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow." A friend of his asked him (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Aufa), "Did the Prophet enter the Ka'ba (during that 'Umra)?" He replied in the negative. Then he said, "What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?" He (‘Abdu’lláh bin Aufa) said, "(He said) 'Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Dinar {#3:20 .italic}

We asked Ibn ‘Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka'ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, "The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'ba seven times and then offered a two Rak'at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Alláh's Apostle you have a good example." And we asked Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh (the same question) and he replied, "He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa."

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ashari {#3:21 .italic}

I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha' while his camel was kneeling down and he asked me, "Have you intended to perform the Hajj?" I replied in the affirmative. He asked me, 'With what intention have you assumed Ihram?" I replied, "I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet. He said, "You have done well. Perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram." So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of ‘Umar who said, "If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hádí (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran)."

Narrated by Al-Aswad {#3:22 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh the slave of Asmá’ bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear Asmá’, whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, "May Alláh bless His Apostle Muḥammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and a little food ration. I, my sister, 'Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and such persons performed 'Umra, and when we had passed our hands over the Ka'ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka'ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for Hajj the same evening."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:23 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or 'Umra, he used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say, "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh; He is One and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers)."

Anas said, "Whenever Alláh's Apostle returned from a journey, he, on seeing the high places of Medina, would make his she-camel proceed faster; and if it were another animal, even then he used to make it proceed faster." Narrated Humaid that the Prophet used to make it proceed faster out of his love for Medina.

Narrated by Anas {#3:29 .italic}

As above, but mentioned "the walls of Medina" instead of "the high places of Medina. Al-Harith bin ‘Umar agrees with Anas.

Narrated by Abu Ishaq {#3:30 .italic}

I heard Al-Bara' saying, "The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was revealed: -- "It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But the righteous man is He who fears Alláh, Obeys His order and keeps away from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors." (2.189)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:31 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Traveling is a kind of torture as it prevents one from eating, drinking and sleeping properly. So, when one's needs are fulfilled, one should return quickly to one's family."

Narrated by Zaid bin Aslam from his father {#3:32 .italic}

I was with Ibn ‘Umar on the way to Mecca, and he got the news that Safiya bint Abu Ubaid was seriously ill. So, he hastened his pace, and when the twilight disappeared, he dismounted and offered the Maghrib and 'Isha' prayers together. Then he said, "I saw that whenever the Prophet had to hasten when traveling, he would delay the Maghrib prayer and join them together (i.e. offer the Maghrib and the Isha prayers together)."

## Volume 3, Book 28

Narrated by Nafi {#3:33 .italic}

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, "If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Alláh's Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Alláh's Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya."

Narrated by Nafi {#3:34 .italic}

That Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdu’lláh and Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh informed him that they told Ibn ‘Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying "There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba." Ibn ‘Umar said "We set out with Alláh's Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka'ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hádí and got his head shaved." Ibn ‘Umar added, "I make you witnesses that I have made 'Umra obligatory for me. And, Alláh willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka'ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka'ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company." Ibn ‘Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, "The conditions of 'Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made 'Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself." So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hádí. He used to say, "I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both 'Umra and Hajj)."

Narrated by Nafi {#3:35 .italic}

Some of the sons of ‘Abdu’lláh told him (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh) if he had stayed (and not performed Hajj that year).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#3:36 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was prevented from performing ('Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hádí and performed Umra in the following year.

Narrated by Salim {#3:37 .italic}

(‘Abdu’lláh) bin ‘Umar used to say, "Is not (the following of) the tradition of Alláh's Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hádí or fast in case he cannot afford the Hádí."

Narrated by Al-Miswar {#3:38 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle slaughtered (the Hádí) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.

Narrated by Nafi {#3:39 .italic}

That ‘Abdu’lláh and Salim said to ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar, "(You should not go for Hajj this year)." ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar replied, "We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing 'Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka'ba. Alláh's Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved."

Narrated by Nafi {#3:40 .italic}

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing 'Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, "If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka'ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Alláh's Apostle ." So, he assumed the Ihram for 'Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for 'Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar thought about it and said, "The conditions for both Hajj and 'Umra are similar." He then turned towards his companions and said, "The conditions of both Hajj and 'Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with 'Umra." He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and ('Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hádí.

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla {#3:41 .italic}

Ka'b bin 'Ujra said that Alláh's Apostle said to him (Ka'b), "Perhaps your lice have troubled you?" Ka'b replied, "Yes! O Alláh's Apostle." Alláh's Apostle said, "Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice."

Narrated by Ka'b bin 'Umra {#3:42 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, "Have your lice troubled you?" I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka'b added, "This Holy Verse:--'And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. "The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ma'qal {#3:43 .italic}

I sat with Ka'b bin 'Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, "This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Alláh's Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, "I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?" I replied in the negative. He then said, "Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food." (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)

Narrated by Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla {#3:44 .italic}

(Reporting the speech of Ka'b bin Umra) Alláh's Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka'b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), "Have your lice troubled you?" He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Alláh revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Alláh's Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:45 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka'ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newly-born child. (Just delivered by his mother)."

## Volume 3, Book 29

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Qatada {#3:47 .italic}

My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), "I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions' help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, "Where did you leave the Prophet ?" He replied, "I left him at Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Alláh's Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.' I added, 'O Alláh's Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Qatada {#3:48 .italic}

That his father said "We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Alláh's Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Alláh's Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta'hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Alláh's Apostle till I reached him and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Alláh's Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them." So he did. Then I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over." Alláh's Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram."

Narrated by Abu Qatada {#3:49 .italic}

We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, "We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram." So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, "Eat it." While some others said, "Do not eat it." So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, "Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Qatada {#3:50 .italic}

That his father had told him that Alláh's Apostle set out for Hajj and so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, "Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together." So, they took the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: "How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?" So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager's meat, and when they met Alláh's Apostle they asked, saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), 'How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?' So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, "Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?" They replied in the negative. He said, "Then eat what is left of its meat."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás {#3:51 .italic}

From As-Sa'b bin Jath-thama Al-Laithi that the latter presented an onager to Alláh's Apostle while he was at Al-Abwa' or at Waddan, and he refused it. On noticing the signs of some unpleasant feeling of disappointment on his (As-Sab's) face, the Prophet said to him, "I have only returned it because I am Muhrim."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:52 .italic}

Abu Shuraih, Al-'Adawi said that he had said to 'Amr bin Sa‘íd when he was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair), "O Chief! Allow me to tell you what Alláh's Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Alláh, started saying, 'Alláh, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Alláh and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Alláh's Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, 'Alláh allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.' "Alláh allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact." Abu Shuraih was asked, "What did 'Amr reply?" He said, ('Amr said) 'O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#3:59 .italic}

"The Prophet said, 'Alláh has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.' Al-‘Abbás said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Except Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.' The Prophet then said, 'Except Al-idhkhir.' " 'Ikrima said, 'Do you know what "chasing or disturbing" the game means? It means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place."

On the day of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet said, "There is no more emigration (from Mecca) but Jihad and intentions, and whenever you are called for Jihad, you should go immediately. No doubt, Alláh has made this place (Mecca) a sanctuary since the creation of the heavens and the earth and will remain a sanctuary till the Day of Resurrection as Alláh has ordained its sanctity. Fighting was not permissible in it for anyone before me, and even for me it was allowed only for a portion of a day. So, it is a sanctuary with Alláh's sanctity till the Day of Resurrection. Its thorns should not be uprooted and its game should not be chased; and its luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by one who would announce that publicly, and its vegetation (grass etc.) should not be cut." Al-‘Abbás said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir, (for it is used by their blacksmiths and for their domestic purposes)." So, the Prophet said, "Except Al-Idhkhir."

‘Abdu’lláh bin Al-‘Abbás and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama differed at Al-Abwa'; Ibn ‘Abbás said that a Muhrim could wash his head; while Al-Miswar maintained that he should not do so. ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás sent me to Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari and I found him bathing between the two wooden posts (of the well) and was screened with a sheet of cloth. I greeted him and he asked who I was. I replied, "I am ‘Abdu’lláh bin Hunain and I have been sent to you by Ibn ‘Abbás to ask you how Alláh's Apostle used to wash his head while in the state of lhram." Abu Aiyub Al-Ansarl caught hold of the sheet of cloth and lowered it till his head appeared before me, and then told somebody to pour water on his head. He poured water on his head, and he (Abu Aiyub) rubbed his head with his hands by bringing them from back to front and from front to back and said, "I saw the Prophet doing like this."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#3:68 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was asked what sort of clothes a Muhrim should wear.

The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat (the place for assuming Ihram) for the people of Medina, and Qaran-al-Manazil for the people of Najd, and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen. These Mawaqit are for those people and also for those who come through these Mawaqit (from places other than the above-mentioned) with the intention of (performing) Hajj and Umra. And those living inside these Mawaqit can assume Ihram from the place where they start; even the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca.

A man bit the hand of another man but in that process the latter broke one incisor tooth of the former, and the Prophet forgave the latter.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#3:74 .italic}

While a man was standing with the Prophet at ‘Arafat, he fell from his Mount and his neck was crushed by it.

The Prophet replied in the affirmative.

Al-Faḍl was riding behind the Prophet and a woman from the tribe of Khath'am came up. Al-Faḍl started looking at her and she looked at him. The Prophet turned Al-Faḍl's face to the other side.

Narrated by Anas {#3:91 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Alláh, the angels, and all the people." (See Ḥadít_h No. 409, Vol 9).

Narrated by Anas {#3:92 .italic}

The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, "O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land)." They said, "We do not want its price except from Alláh" (i.e. they wished for a reward from Alláh for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:93 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains." The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), "I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary," but looking around, he added, "No, you are inside the sanctuary."

Narrated by ‘Alí {#3:94 .italic}

And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Alláh, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Alláh, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#3:106 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, "Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, 'I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Alláh's Apostle .' Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, 'If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?' They will say, 'No.' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, 'Now I know your reality better than before.' Ad-Dajjal will say, 'I want to kill him but I cannot.' "

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#3:108 .italic}

When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them.

(4.88) The Prophet said, "Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron."

And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: "Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!" The Prophet said, "O Alláh! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi'a and 'Utba bin Rabi'a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics." Alláh's Apostle then said, "O Alláh! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Alláh! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa."

Narrated by Talha bin 'Ubaid-Ullah {#3:115 .italic}

A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Inform me what Alláh has made compulsory for me as regards the prayers." He replied: "You have to offer perfectly the five compulsory prayers in a day and night (24 hours), unless you want to pray Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Inform me what Alláh has made compulsory for me as regards fasting." He replied, "You have to fast during the whole month of Ramaḍán, unless you want to fast more as Nawafil." The bedouin further asked, "Tell me how much Zakat Alláh has enjoined on me." Thus, Alláh's Apostle informed him about all the rules (i.e. fundamentals) of Islam. The bedouin then said, "By Him Who has honored you, I will neither perform any Nawafil nor will I decrease what Alláh has enjoined on me. Alláh's Apostle said, "If he is saying the truth, he will succeed (or he will be granted Paradise)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:116 .italic}

The Prophet observed the fast on the 10th of Muharram ('Ashura), and ordered (Muslims) to fast on that day, but when the fasting of the month of Ramaḍán was prescribed, the fasting of the 'Ashura' was abandoned. ‘Abdu’lláh did not use to fast on that day unless it coincided with his routine fasting by chance.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:117 .italic}

(The tribe of) Quraish used to fast on the day of Ashura' in the Pre-lslamic period, and then Alláh's Apostle ordered (Muslims) to fast on it till the fasting in the month of Ramaḍán was prescribed; whereupon the Prophet said, "He who wants to fast (on 'Ashura') may fast, and he who does not want to fast may not fast."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:118 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Fasting is a shield (or a screen or a shelter). So, the person observing fasting should avoid sexual relation with his wife and should not behave foolishly and impudently, and if somebody fights with him or abuses him, he should tell him twice, 'I am fasting." The Prophet added, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Alláh than the smell of musk. (Alláh says about the fasting person), 'He has left his food, drink and desires for My sake. The fast is for Me. So I will reward (the fasting person) for it and the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times."

Narrated by Abu Wail from Hudhaifa {#3:119 .italic}

‘Umar asked the people, "Who remembers the narration of the Prophet about the affliction?" Hudhaifa said, "I heard the Prophet saying, 'The affliction of a person in his property, family and neighbors is expiated by his prayers, fasting, and giving in charity." ‘Umar said, "I do not ask about that, but I ask about those afflictions which will spread like the waves of the sea." Hudhaifa replied, "There is a closed gate in front of those afflictions." ‘Umar asked, "Will that gate be opened or broken?" He replied, "It will be broken." ‘Umar said, "Then the gate will not be closed again till the Day of Resurrection." We said to Masruq, "Would you ask Hudhaifa whether ‘Umar knew what that gate symbolized?" He asked him and he replied "He (‘Umar) knew it as one knows that there will be night before tomorrow, morning.

Narrated by Sahl {#3:120 .italic}

The Prophet said, "There is a gate in Paradise called Ar-Raiyan, and those who observe fasts will enter through it on the Day of Resurrection and none except them will enter through it. It will be said, 'Where are those who used to observe fasts?' They will get up, and none except them will enter through it. After their entry the gate will be closed and nobody will enter through it."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:121 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever gives two kinds (of things or property) in charity for Alláh's Cause, will be called from the gates of Paradise and will be addressed, 'O slaves of Alláh! Here is prosperity.' So, whoever was amongst the people who used to offer their prayers, will be called from the gate of the prayer; and whoever was amongst the people who used to participate in Jihad, will be called from the gate of Jihad; and whoever was amongst those who used to observe fasts, will be called from the gate of Ar-Raiyan; whoever was amongst those who used to give in charity, will be called from the gate of charity." Abu Bakr said, "Let my parents be sacrificed for you, O Alláh's Apostle! No distress or need will befall him who will be called from those gates. Will there be any one who will be called from all these gates?" The Prophet replied, "Yes, and I hope you will be one of them."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:125 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever established prayers on the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from Alláh, then all his previous sins will be forgiven; and whoever fasts in the month of Ramaḍán out of sincere faith, and hoping for a reward from Alláh, then all his previous sins will be forgiven."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#3:126 .italic}

The Prophet was the most generous amongst the people, and he used to be more so in the month of Ramaḍán when Gabriel visited him, and Gabriel used to meet him on every night of Ramaḍán till the end of the month. The Prophet used to recite the Holy Qur’án to Gabriel, and when Gabriel met him, he used to be more generous than a fast wind (which causes rain and welfare).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:127 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions, Alláh is not in need of his leaving his food and drink (i.e. Alláh will not accept his fasting.)"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:128 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh said, 'All the deeds of Adam's sons (people) are for them, except fasting which is for Me, and I will give the reward for it.' Fasting is a shield or protection from the fire and from committing sins. If one of you is fasting, he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarreling, and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him, he should say, 'I am fasting.' By Him in Whose Hands my soul is' The unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Alláh than the smell of musk. There are two pleasures for the fasting person, one at the time of breaking his fast, and the other at the time when he will meet his Lord; then he will be pleased because of his fasting."

Narrated by 'Alqama {#3:129 .italic}

While I was walking with ‘Abdu’lláh he said, "We were in the company of the Prophet and he said, 'He who can afford to marry should marry, because it will help him refrain from looking at other women, and save his private parts from looking at other women, and save his private parts from committing illegal sexual relation; and he who cannot afford to marry is advised to fast, as fasting will diminish his sexual power."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:130 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle mentioned Ramaḍán and said, "Do not fast unless you see the crescent (of Ramaḍán), and do not give up fasting till you see the crescent (of Shawwal), but if the sky is overcast (if you cannot see it), then act on estimation (i.e. count Sha'ban as 30 days)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:131 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The month (can be) 29 nights (i.e. days), and do not fast till you see the moon, and if the sky is overcast, then complete Sha'ban as thirty days."

It was the custom among the companions of Muḥammad that if any of them was fasting and the food was presented (for breaking his fast), but he slept before eating, he would not eat that night and the following day till sunset. Qais bin Sirma-al-Ansari was fasting and came to his wife at the time of Iftar (breaking one's fast) and asked her whether she had anything to eat. She replied, "No, but I would go and bring some for you." He used to do hard work during the day, so he was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. When his wife came and saw him, she said, "Disappointment for you." When it was midday on the following day, he fainted and the Prophet was informed about the whole matter and the following verses were revealed: "You are permitted To go to your wives (for sexual relation) At the night of fasting." So, they were overjoyed by it. And then Alláh also revealed: "And eat and drink Until the white thread Of dawn appears to you Distinct from the black thread (of the night)." (2.187)

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#3:140 .italic}

When the above verses were revealed: 'Until the white thread appears to you, distinct from the black thread,' I took two (hair) strings, one black and the other white, and kept them under my pillow and went on looking at them throughout the night but could not make anything out of it. So, the next morning I went to Alláh's Apostle and told him the whole story. He explained to me, "That verse means the darkness of the night and the whiteness of the dawn."

The Prophet never fasted in any month more than in the month of Sha'ban. He used to say, "Do those deeds which you can do easily, as Alláh will not get tired (of giving rewards) till you get bored and tired (of performing religious deeds)." The most beloved prayer to the Prophet was the one that was done regularly (throughout the life) even if it were little. And whenever the Prophet offered a prayer he used to offer it regularly.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#3:192 .italic}

The Prophet never fasted a full month except the month of Ramaḍán, and he used to fast till one could say, "By Alláh, he will never stop fasting," and he would abandon fasting till one would say, "By Alláh, he will never fast."

Narrated by Humaid {#3:194 .italic}

I asked Anas about the fasting of the Prophet. He said "Whenever I liked to see the Prophet fasting in any month, I could see that, and whenever I liked to see him not fasting, I could see that too, and if I liked to see him praying in any night, I could see that, and if I liked to see him sleeping, I could see that, too." Anas further said, "I never touched silk or velvet softer than the hand of Alláh's Apostle and never smelled musk or perfumed smoke more pleasant than the smell of Alláh's Apostle."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr bin Al-'As {#3:195 .italic}

"Once Alláh's Apostle came to me," and then he narrated the whole narration, i.e. your guest has a right on you, and your wife has a right on you. I then asked about the fasting of David. The Prophet replied, "Half of the year," (i.e. he used to fast on every alternate day).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr bin Al-'As {#3:196 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said to me, "O ‘Abdu’lláh! Have I not been informed that you fast during the day and offer prayers all the night." ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "Don't do that; fast for few days and then give it up for few days, offer prayers and also sleep at night, as your body has a right on you, and your wife has a right on you, and your guest has a right on you. And it is sufficient for you to fast three days in a month, as the reward of a good deed is multiplied ten times, so it will be like fasting throughout the year." I insisted (on fasting) and so I was given a hard instruction. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have power." The Prophet said, "Fast like the fasting of the Prophet David and do not fast more than that." I said, "How was the fasting of the Prophet of Alláh, David?" He said, "Half of the year," (i.e. he used to fast on every alternate day). Afterwards when ‘Abdu’lláh became old, he used to say, "It would have been better for me if I had accepted the permission of the Prophet (which he gave me i.e. to fast only three days a month)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#3:197 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was informed that I had taken an oath to fast daily and to pray (every night) all the night throughout my life (so Alláh's Apostle came to me and asked whether it was correct): I replied, "Let my parents be sacrificed for you! I said so." The Prophet said, "You can not do that. So, fast for few days and give it up for few days, r ray and sleep. Fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting." I replied, "I can do better than that." The Prophet said to me, "Fast one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of Prophet David and that is the best fasting." I said, "I have the power to fast better (more) than that." The Prophet said, "There is no better fasting than that."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#3:198 .italic}

The news of my daily fasting and praying every night throughout the night reached the Prophet. So he sent for me or I met him, and he said, "I have been informed that you fast everyday and pray every night (all the night). Fast (for some days) and give up fasting (for some days); pray and sleep, for your eyes have a right on you, and your body and your family (i.e. wife) have a right on you." I replied, "I have more power than that (fasting)." The Prophet said, "Then fast like the fasts of (the Prophet) David". I said, "How?" He replied, "He used to fast on alternate days, and he used not to flee on meeting the enemy." I said, "From where can I get that chance?" ('Ata' said, "I do not know how the expression of fasting daily throughout the life occurred.") So, the Prophet said, twice, "Whoever fasts daily throughout his life is just as the one who does not fast at all."

Narrated by Mujahid from ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#3:199 .italic}

The Prophet said (to ‘Abdu’lláh), "Fast three days a month." ‘Abdu’lláh said, (to the Prophet) "I am able to fast more than that." They kept on arguing on this matter till the Prophet said, "Fast on alternate days, and recite the whole Qur’án once a month." ‘Abdu’lláh said, "I can recite more (in a month)," and the argument went on till the Prophet said, "Recite the Qur’án once each three days." (i.e. you must not recite the whole Qur’án in less than three days).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr bin Al-'As {#3:200 .italic}

The Prophet said to me, "You fast daily all the year and pray every night all the night?" I replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, "If you keep on doing this, your eyes will become weak and your body will get tired. He who fasts all the year is as he who did not fast at all. The fasting of three days (a month) will be equal to the tasting of the whole year." I replied, "I have the power for more than this." The Prophet said, "Then fast like the fasting of David who used to fast on alternate days and would never flee from the battle field, on meeting the enemy.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#3:201 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was informed about my fasts, and he came to me and I spread for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fires, but he sat on the ground and the cushion remained between me and him, and then he said, "Isn't it sufficient for you to fast three days a month?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! (I can fast more)." He said, "Five?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! (I can fast more)." He said, "Seven?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! (I can fast more)." He said, "Nine (days per month)?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! (I can fast more)" He said, "Eleven (days per month)?" And then the Prophet said, "There is no fast superior to that of the Prophet David it was for half of the year. So, fast on alternate days."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:202 .italic}

My friend (the Prophet ) advised me to observe three things: (1) to fast three days a month; (2) to pray two Rakat of Duha prayer (fore-noon prayer); and (3) to pray Witr before sleeping.

The Prophet paid a visit to Um-Sulaim and she placed before him dates and ghee. The Prophet said, "Replace the ghee and dates in their respective containers for I am fasting." Then he stood somewhere in her house and offered an optional prayer and then he invoked good on Um-Sulaim and her family. Then Um-Sulaim said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have a special request (today)." He said, "What is it?" She replied, "(Please invoke for) your servant Anas." So Alláh's Apostle did not leave anything good in the world or the Hereafter which he did not invoke (Alláh to bestow) on me and said, "O Alláh! Give him (i.e. Anas) property and children and bless him." Thus I am one of the richest among the Ansar and my daughter Umaina told me that when A-Hajjaj came to Basra, more than 120 of my offspring had been buried.

Narrated by Alqama {#3:208 .italic}

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:226 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying regarding Ramaḍán, "Whoever prayed at night in it (the month of Ramaḍán) out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Alláh, then all his previous sins will be forgiven."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:227 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramaḍán out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Alláh, then all his previous sins will be forgiven." Ibn Shihab (a sub-narrator) said, "Alláh's Apostle died and the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of ‘Umar's Caliphate." 'Abdur Rahman bin ‘Abdu’l- Qari said, "I went out in the company of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab one night in Ramaḍán to the mosque and found the people praying in different groups. A man praying alone or a man praying with a little group behind him. So, ‘Umar said, 'In my opinion I would better collect these (people) under the leadership of one Qari (Reciter) (i.e. let them pray in congregation!)'. So, he made up his mind to congregate them behind Ubai bin Ka'b. Then on another night I went again in his company and the people were praying behind their reciter. On that, ‘Umar remarked, 'What an excellent Bid'a (i.e. innovation in religion) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.' He meant the prayer in the last part of the night. (In those days) people used to pray in the early part of the night."

(the wife of the Prophet) Alláh's Apostle used to pray (at night) in Ramaḍán.

That he was informed by 'Aisha, "Alláh's Apostle went out in the middle of the night and prayed in the mosque and some men prayed behind him. In the morning, the people spoke about it and then a large number of them gathered and prayed behind him (on the second night). In the next morning the people again talked about it and on the third night the mosque was full with a large number of people. Alláh's Apostle came out and the people prayed behind him. On the fourth night the Mosque was overwhelmed with people and could not accommodate them, but the Prophet came out (only) for the morning prayer. When the morning prayer was finished he recited Tashah-hud and (addressing the people) said, "Amma ba'du, your presence was not hidden from me but I was afraid lest the night prayer (Qiyam) should be enjoined on you and you might not be able to carry it on." So, Alláh's Apostle died and the situation remained like that (i.e. people prayed individually). "

Narrated by Abu Salama bin 'Abdur Rahman {#3:230 .italic}

That he asked 'Aisha "How was the prayer of Alláh's Apostle in Ramaḍán?" She replied, "He did not pray more than eleven Rakat in Ramaḍán or in any other month. He used to pray four Rakat ... let alone their beauty and length... and then he would pray four... let alone their beauty and length... and then he would pray three Rakat (Witr)." She added, "I asked, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Do you sleep before praying the Witr?' He replied, 'O 'Aisha! My eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:231 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever fasted the month of Ramaḍán out of sincere Faith (i.e. belief) and hoping for a reward from Alláh, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stood for the prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Alláh, then all his previous sins will be forgiven ."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:232 .italic}

Some men amongst the companions of the Prophet were shown in their dreams that the night of Qadr was in the last seven nights of Ramaḍán. Alláh's Apostle said, "It seems that all your dreams agree that (the Night of Qadr) is in the last seven nights, and whoever wants to search for it (i.e. the Night of Qadr) should search in the last seven (nights of Ramaḍán)."

Narrated by Abu Salama {#3:233 .italic}

I asked Abu Sa‘íd, and he was a friend of mine, (about the Night of Qadr) and he said, "We practiced Itikaf (seclusion in the mosque) in the middle third of the month of Ramaḍán with the Prophet . In the morning of the 20th of Ramaḍán, the Prophet came and addressed us and said, 'I was informed of (the date of the Night of Qadr) but I was caused to forget it; so search for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramaḍán. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water (as a sign). So, whoever was in l'tikaf with me should return to it with me (for another 10-day's period)', and we returned. At that time there was no sign of clouds in the sky but suddenly a cloud came and it rained till rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of date-palm leaf stalks. Then the prayer was established and I saw Alláh's Apostle prostrating in mud and water and I saw the traces of mud on his forehead."

Once in Ramaḍán, in which he practiced Itikaf, he established the night prayers at the night in which he used to return home, and then he addressed the people and ordered them whatever Alláh wished him to order and said, "I used to practice Itikaf for these ten days (i.e. the middle 113rd but now I intend to stay in Itikaf for the last ten days (of the month); so whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay at his place of seclusion. I have verily been shown (the date of) this Night (of Qadr) but I have forgotten it. So search for it in the odd nights of the last ten days (of this month). I also saw myself (in the dream) prostrating in mud and water." On the night of the 21st, the sky was covered with clouds and it rained, and the rain-water started leaking through the roof of the mosque at the praying place of the Prophet .

Narrated by 'Ubada bin As-Samit {#3:240 .italic}

The Prophet came out to inform us about the Night of Qadr but two Muslims were quarreling with each other. So, the Prophet said, "I came out to inform you about the Night of Qadr but such-and-such persons were quarreling, so the news about it had been taken away; yet that might be for your own good, so search for it on the 29th, 27th and 25th (of Ramaḍán).

Narrated by Aisha {#3:241 .italic}

With the start of the last ten days of Ramaḍán, the Prophet used to tighten his waist belt (i.e. work hard) and used to pray all the night, and used to keep his family awake for the prayers.

In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, 'What is this?" He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, "Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?" He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:250 .italic}

The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of 'Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, "Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?" And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramaḍán) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.

Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Alláh's Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramaḍán. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Alláh's Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, "She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai." Both of them said, "Subhan Alláh, (How dare we think of any evil) O Alláh's Apostle!" And they felt it.

So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramaḍán. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Alláh's Apostle should return for it.' The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Alláh's Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.

The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, "Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai." They replied, "Subhan Alláh, (How dare we think of evil) O Alláh's Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you)." The Prophet replied, "Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds."

Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, "Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, "This is Safiya"). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam's offspring as his blood circulates in it."

When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muḥammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.

Narrated by 'Amra bint 'Abdur-Rahman from 'Aisha {#3:257 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramaḍán. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. 'Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Alláh's Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, "What is this?" He was informed about it. He then said, "What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them." So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramaḍán, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.

Hafsa asked \‘Aisha to take his permission for her, and she did so. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw that, she ordered a tent to be pitched for her and it was pitched for her. Alláh's Apostle used to proceed to his tent after the prayer. So, he saw the tents ans asked, "What is this?" He was told that those were the tents of Aisha, Hafsa, and Zainab.

## Volume 3, Book 34

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:263 .italic}

You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from Alláh's Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate from Alláh's Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were busy in the market while I used to stick to Alláh's Apostle content with what fills my stomach; so I used to be present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Alláh's Apostle once said, "Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember whatever I will say." So, I spread my colored garment which I was wearing till Alláh's Apostle had finished his saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations.

Narrated by Ibrahim bin Sad from his father from his grand-father {#3:264 .italic}

Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, "When we came to Medina as emigrants, Alláh's Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad bin Ar-Rabi'. Sad bin Ar-Rabi' said (to me), 'I am the richest among the Ansar, so I will give you half of my wealth and you may look at my two wives and whichever of the two you may choose I will divorce her, and when she has completed the prescribed period (before marriage) you may marry her.' Abdur-Rahman replied, "I am not in need of all that. Is there any market-place where trade is practiced?' He replied, "The market of Qainuqa." Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day and brought some dried butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he continued going there regularly. Few days later, 'AbdurRahman came having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Alláh's Apostle asked him whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, 'Whom have you married?' He replied, 'A woman from the Ansar.' Then the Prophet asked, 'How much did you pay her?' He replied, '(I gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a date stone (or a date stone of gold)! The Prophet said, 'Give a Walima (wedding banquet) even if with one sheep .' "

Narrated by Anas {#3:265 .italic}

When Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina, the Prophet established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi al-Ansari. Sad was a rich man, so he said to 'Abdur-Rahman, "I will give you half of my property and will help you marry." 'Abdur-Rahman said (to him), "May Alláh bless you in your family and property.

Sins are Alláh's Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoever pastures (his sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment."

I met ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr bin Al-'As and asked him, "Tell me about the description of Alláh's Apostle which is mentioned in Torah (i.e. Old Testament.") He replied, 'Yes. By Alláh, he is described in Torah with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur’án as follows: "O Prophet ! We have sent you as a witness (for Alláh's True religion) And a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), And a warner (to the unbelievers) And guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My messenger (i.e. Apostle). I have named you "Al-Mutawakkil" (who depends upon Alláh). You are neither discourteous, harsh Nor a noise-maker in the markets And you do not do evil to those Who do evil to you, but you deal With them with forgiveness and kindness. Alláh will not let him (the Prophet) Die till he makes straight the crooked people by making them say: "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh," With which will be opened blind eyes And deaf ears and enveloped hearts."

The Ajwa on one side, the cluster of Ibn Zaid on another side, etc.. Then call me." I did that and called the Prophet He came and sat at the head or in the middle of the heaps and ordered me. Measure (the dates) for the people (creditors)." I measured for them till I paid all the debts. My dates remained as it nothing had been taken from them. In other narrations, Jabir said; The Prophet said, "He (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh) continued measuring for them till he paid all the debts."

The children were crying at my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it was dawn. O Alláh! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then please remove this rock so that we may see the sky.' So, the rock was moved a bit. The second said, 'O Alláh! You know that I was in love with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a woman, and she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Alláh, and asked me not to deflower her except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Alláh! If You regard that I did if for Your sake, kindly remove this rock.' So, two-thirds of the rock was removed. Then the third man said, 'O Alláh! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for one Faraq (three Sa's) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he refused to take it, so I sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and a shepherd. After a time that man came and demanded his money. I said to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for they are for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I was not joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Alláh! If You regard that I did it sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the rock.' So, the rock was removed completely from the mouth of the cave."

The Prophet said, "The Prophet Abraham emigrated with Sarah and entered a village where there was a king or a tyrant. (The king) was told that Abraham had entered (the village) accompanied by a woman who was one of the most charming women. So, the king sent for Abraham and asked, 'O Abraham! Who is this lady accompanying you?' Abraham replied, 'She is my sister (i.e. in religion).' Then Abraham returned to her and said, 'Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my sister. By Alláh, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.' Then Abraham sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O Alláh! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' On that the king fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the condition of the king, Sarah said, 'O Alláh! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.' The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up again and performed ablution, prayed and said, 'O Alláh! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.' The king again fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, 'O Alláh! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.' The king got either two or three attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, 'By Alláh! You have sent a satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her Ajar.' So she came back to Abraham and said, 'Alláh humiliated the pagan and gave us a slavegirl for service."

The man said to them, 'Don't quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.' But they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after them and said to them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first batch.' So, they worked till the time of 'Asr prayer. Then they said, "Let what we have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.' The man said to them, 'Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,' but they refused.

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Three men from among those who were before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and entered it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said (to each other), Nothing could save you Tom this rock but to invoke Alláh by giving referenda to the righteous deed which you have done (for Alláh's sake only).' So, one of them said, 'O Alláh! I had old parents and I never provided my family (wife, children etc.) with milk before them. One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had slept. I milked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then they got up and drank the milk. O Alláh! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from our critical situation caused by this rock.' So, the rock shifted a little but they could not get out." The Prophet added, "The second man said, 'O Alláh! I had a cousin who was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual relations with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a famine year and she came to me and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal for you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have sexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to me, and also I left the gold I had given her. O Alláh! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from the present calamity.' So, the rock shifted a little more but still they could not get out from there." The Prophet added, "Then the third man said, 'O Alláh! I employed few laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who did not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got much property thereby. (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Alláh's slave! Pay me my wages. I said to him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Alláh's slave! Don't mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove them away and left nothing. O Alláh! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from the present suffering.' So, that rock shifted completely and they got out walking.

Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey till they reached some of the ‘Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said (to the others), "Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided here at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as treatment)," They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet ) and said, "Our chief has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has not benefitted. Have you got anything (useful)?" One of them replied, "Yes, by Alláh! I can recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for it." They agrees to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): 'All the praises are for the Lord of the Worlds' and puffed over the chief who became all right as if he was released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of sickness. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the recitation said, "Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and narrate the whole story to him, and wait for his order." So, they went to Alláh's Apostle and narrated the story. Alláh's Apostle asked, "How did you come to know that Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?" Then he added, "You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well." The Prophet smiled thereupon.

Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a dead man was brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the deceased. He said, "Is he in debt?" The people replied in the negative. He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, "No." So, he led his funeral prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Lead his funeral prayer." The Prophet said, "Is he in debt?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, ''Three Dinars." So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral prayer." He said, "Has he left any wealth?" They said, "No." He asked, "Is he in debt?" They said, ("Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.', He (refused to pray and) said, "Then pray for your (dead) companion." Abu Qatada said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Lead his funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt." So, he led the prayer.

The Prophet said, "An Israeli man asked another Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former replied, 'Alláh is sufficient as a witness.' The second said, 'I want a surety.' The former replied, 'Alláh is sufficient as a surety.' The second said, 'You are right,' and lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it, inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. 'O Alláh! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Alláh's Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Alláh was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.' Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country. One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one thousand Dinars to him and said, 'By Alláh, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.' The lender asked, 'Have you sent something to me?' The debtor replied, 'I have told you I could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.' The lender said, 'Alláh has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.' "

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "In the verse: To every one We have appointed ' (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one's) heirs (4.33).' (And regarding the verse) 'And those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.' Ibn ‘Abbás said, "When the emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the latter's relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: 'And to everyone We have appointed heirs' (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the bond (the pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance)." Then he said, "The verse: To those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible to assign something in one's testament to the person who had the right of inheriting before.

Once the Prophet said (to me), "If the money of Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it." The Prophet had breathed his last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr announced, "Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us." I went to Abu Bakr and said, "The Prophet promised me so and so." Abu Bakr gave me a handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then said, "Take twice the amount you have taken (besides)."

Narrated by Aisha {#3:494 .italic}

(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam. Not a single day passed but Alláh's Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant. When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, "Where are you going?" Abu Bakr said, "My people have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my Lord." Ibn Ad-Daghna said, "A man like you will not go out, nor will he be turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at your home." Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of Quraish saying to them, "A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the people during their troubles?" So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna's guarantee of protection and told Abú- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, "Advise Abu Bakr to worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him." Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abú- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in his house and did not pray or recite Qur’án aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea and started praying and reciting Qur’án there publicly. The women and the offspring of the pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur’án. This horrified the pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, "We have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house, but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his house and offered his prayer and recited Qur’án in public. We are afraid lest he mislead our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr's public declaration of Islam (his worshipping)." 'Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said, "You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the 'Arabs saying that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not respect it." Abu Bakr said, "I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied with Alláh's protection." At that time Alláh's Apostle was still in Mecca and he said to his companions, "Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two ,Harras." So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina, and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared for emigration, Alláh's Apostle said to him, "Wait, for I expect to be permitted to emigrate." Abu Bakr asked, "May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you really expect that?" Alláh's Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr postponed his departure in order to accompany Alláh's Apostle and fed two camels which he had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:495 .italic}

Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Alláh's Apostle he would ask, "Has he left anything to repay his debt?" If he was informed that he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he would tell the Muslims to offer their friend's funeral prayer. When Alláh made the Prophet wealthy through conquests, he said, "I am more rightful than other believers to be the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his heirs."

When I mentioned the word 'Ar-Rahman' in the documents, Umaiya said, "I do not know 'Ar-Rahman.' Write down to me your name, (with which you called yourself) in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance." So, I wrote my name ' 'Abdu 'Amr'. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill to protect him. Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering of Ansar and said, "(Here is) Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he escapes!" So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal to follow us ('Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I left Umaiya's son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the son and insisted on following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and I laid myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his sword. (The sub narrator said, " 'Abdur-Rahman used to show us the trace of the wound on the back of his foot.")

The man replied, "(No), we exchange two Sa's of bad dates for one Sa of this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or exchange three Sa's for two." On that, the Prophet said, "Don't do so, as it is a kind of usury (Riba) but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy Janib with the money". The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by weight. (See Ḥadít_h No. 506).

The narrator added, Alláh's Apostle c had been waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When they realized that Alláh's Apostle would return to them only one of two things, they said, "We choose our captives." So, Alláh's Apostle got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised Alláh as He deserved, and said, "Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first booty which Alláh will give us then he can do so." The people replied, "We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor for Alláh's Apostle." Then Alláh's Apostle said, "We don't know who amongst you has agreed and who hasn't. Go back and your chiefs may tell us your opinion." So, all of them returned and their chiefs discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their chiefs) came to Alláh's Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given up their shares gladly and willingly.

When I gave it to him, he beat the camel and rebuked it. Then that camel surpassed the others thenceforth. The Prophet said, "Sell it to me." I replied, "It is (a gift) for you, O Alláh's Apostle." He said, "Sell it to me. I have bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it till Medina." When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my house). The Prophet said, "Where are you going?" I Sad, "I have married a widow." He said, "Why have you not married a virgin to fondle with each other?" I said, "My father died and left daughters, so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to look after them)." He said, "Well done." When we reached Medina, Alláh's Apostle said, "O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra money." Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra.

(If you do so), Alláh will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no satan will come near you till morning. " So, I released him. In the morning, Alláh's Apostle asked, "What did your prisoner do yesterday?" I replied, "He claimed that he would teach me some words by which Alláh will benefit me, so I let him go." Alláh's Apostle asked, "What are they?" I replied, "He said to me, 'Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-al-Kursi from the beginning to the end -- Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-lHaiy-ul-Qaiyum--.'

We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get so-and-so much. Al-Ḥasan said, "There is no harm if the land belongs to one but both spend on it and the yield is divided between them." Az-Zuhri had the same opinion. Al-Ḥasan said, "There is no harm if cotton is picked on the condition of having half the yield." Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, 'Ata', Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said, "There is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to the weaver for his labor." Ma'am said, "There is no harm in hiring animals for a definite (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the animals is given to the owner of the animals."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:521 .italic}

The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When ‘Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and 'Aisha chose the land.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:522 .italic}

The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated.

Narrated by 'Amr {#3:523 .italic}

I said to Tawus, "I wish you would give up Mukhabara (Share-cropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it." On that Tawus replied, "O 'Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No doubt; the most learned man, namely Ibn ‘Abbás told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, 'It is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one's brother than to charge him a fixed rental."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:524 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jew's on the condition that they work on it and cultivate it, and be given half of its yield.

Narrated by Rafi {#3:525 .italic}

We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We used to rent the land and say to the owner, "The yield of this portion is for us and the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent)." One of those portions might yield something and the other might not. So, the Prophet forbade us to do so.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:526 .italic}

The Prophet said, "While three men were walking, It started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other, "Think of good deeds which you did for Alláh's sake only, and invoke Alláh by giving reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you." One of them said, 'O Alláh! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Alláh! If I did this for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.' So, Alláh removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, 'O Alláh! I was in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, 'O Alláh's slave! Be afraid of Alláh and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).' So, I got up. O Alláh! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.' The rock shifted a little more. Then the third man said, 'O Alláh! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, 'Fear Alláh (and give me my right)." I said, 'Go and take those cows and the shepherd.' He said, 'Be afraid of Alláh! Don't mock at me.' I said, 'I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).' So, he took all that. O Alláh! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.' So, Alláh removed the rock."

Narrated by Zaid bin Aslam from his father {#3:527 .italic}

‘Umar said, "But for the future Muslim generations, I would have distributed the land of the villages I conquer among the soldiers as the Prophet distributed the land of Khaibar."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:528 .italic}

The Prophet said, "He who cultivates land that does not belong to anybody is more rightful (to own it)." 'Urwa said, "‘Umar gave the same verdict in his Caliphate."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:529 .italic}

While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said to him, "You are in a blessed valley." Musa said, "Salim let our camels kneel at the place where ‘Abdu’lláh used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where Alláh's Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road."

Narrated by ‘Umar {#3:530 .italic}

While the Prophet was in Al-'Aqiq he said, "Someone (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, 'Offer the prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) Umra along with Hajj (together).' "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:531 .italic}

‘Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Ḥijáz. When Alláh's Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land became the property of Alláh, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Alláh's Apostle intended to expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Alláh's Apostle told them, "We will let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish." So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on living there until ‘Umar forced them to go towards Taima' and Ariha'.

Narrated by Rafi bin Khadij {#3:532 .italic}

My uncle Zuhair said, "Alláh's Apostle forbade us to do a thing which was a source of help to us." I said, "Whatever Alláh's Apostle said was right." He said, "Alláh's Apostle sent for me and asked, 'What are you doing with your farms?' I replied, 'We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for some Wasqs of barley and dates.' Alláh's Apostle said, 'Do not do so, but cultivate (the land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.' I said, 'We hear and obey.'

Narrated by Jabir {#3:533 .italic}

The people used to rent their land for cultivation for one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, "Whoever has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it uncultivated." Narrated Abu Huraira: Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise he should keep it uncultivated."

Narrated by 'Amr {#3:534 .italic}

When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi 'bin Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, "It is permissible to rent the land for cultivation, for Ibn ‘Abbás said, 'The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had better give the land to one's brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.' "

Narrated by Nafi {#3:535 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, 'Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi 'bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn ‘Umar went to Rafi' and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn ‘Umar said, "You know that we used to rent our farms in the life-time of Alláh's Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and for certain amount of figs.

Narrated by Salim {#3:536 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "I knew that the land was rented for cultivation in the life-time of Alláh's Apostle ." Later on Ibn ‘Umar was afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up renting his land.

Narrated by Hanzla bin Qais {#3:537 .italic}

Rafi bin Khadij said, "My two uncles told me that they (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the Prophet for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it." I said to Rafi, "What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?" He replied, "There is no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, "If those who have discernment for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:538 .italic}

Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin was sitting with him. "One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Alláh to allow him to cultivate the land. Alláh will ask him, 'Are you not living in the pleasures you like?' He will say, 'Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.' " The Prophet added, "When the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink. Alláh will then say to him, 'O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing satisfies you.' " On that, the bedouin said, "The man must be either from Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not farmers." The Prophet smiled (at this).

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#3:539 .italic}

We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water streams, and cook them in a pot of her's, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya'qub, the sub-narrator said, "I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain fat or melted fat (taken from meat).") When we offered the Friday prayer we would go to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e. Friday prayer) .

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:540 .italic}

The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations. In fact Alláh knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, "Why do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?" In fact, my emigrant brethren were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I was a poor man keeping the company of Alláh's Apostle and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Ḥadít_h). One day the Prophet said, "Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement." So, I spread my covering sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Alláh's Apostle) with the truth, since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of mine. By Alláh, but for two verses in Alláh's Book, I would never have related any narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): "Verily! Those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down .....(up to) the Merciful.' (2.159-160)

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#3:541 .italic}

A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet asked, "O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old men?" The boy said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk." So, the Prophet gave it to him.

Narrated by Az-Zuhri {#3:542 .italic}

Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked for Alláh's Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was mixed with water drawn from the well in Anas's house. A tumbler of it was presented to Alláh's Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his right side. When the Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, ‘Umar was afraid that the Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. "O Alláh's Apostle! Give it to Abu Bakr who is sitting by your side." But the Prophet gave it to the bedouin, who was to his right and said, "You should start with the one on your right side."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Mas'ud) {#3:546 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever takes a false oath to deprive somebody of his property will meet Alláh while He will be angry with him." Alláh revealed: 'Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Alláh's covenant, and their oaths.' ........(3.77) Al-Ash'ath came (to the place where ‘Abdu’lláh was narrating) and said, "What has Abu 'Abdur-Rahman (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh) been telling you? This verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin of mine. The Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my claim). I said, 'I don't have witnesses.' He said, 'Let the defendant take an oath then.' I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! He will take a (false) oath immediately.' Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and Alláh revealed the verse to confirm what he had said." (See Ḥadít_h No. 692)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:547 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "There are three persons whom Alláh will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs shall be a severe punishment. They are: 1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he withheld it from travelers. 2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he gave it only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets dissatisfied. 3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the 'Asr prayer and he said, 'By Alláh, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have been given so much for my goods,' and somebody believes him (and buys them)." The Prophet then recited: "Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Alláh's Covenant and their oaths." (3.77)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair {#3:548 .italic}

An Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair in the presence of the Prophet about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. The Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, "Let the water pass' but Az-Zubair refused to do so. So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said to Az-Zubair, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor." On that the Ansari got angry and said to the Prophet, "Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your aunt's son?" On that the color of the face of Alláh's Apostle changed (because of anger) and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees." Zubair said, "By Alláh, I think that the following verse was revealed on this occasion": "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)

Narrated by 'Urwa {#3:549 .italic}

When a man from the Ansar quarrelled with AzZubair, the Prophet said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then let the water flow (to the land of the others)." "On that the Ansari said, (to the Prophet), "It is because he is your aunt's son." On that the Prophet said, "O Zubair! Irrigate till the water reaches the walls between the pits around the trees and then stop (i.e. let the water go to the other's land)." I think the following verse was revealed concerning this event: "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)

Narrated by 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair {#3:550 .italic}

An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in the Harra which was used for irrigating date-palms. Alláh's Apostle, ordering Zubair to be moderate, said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then leave the water for your neighbor." The Ansari said, "Is it because he is your aunt's son?" On that the color of the face of Alláh's Apostle changed and he said, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the pits around the trees." So, Alláh's Apostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said, "By Alláh, the following verse was revealed in that connection": "But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65) (The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another sub-narrator), "The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet, 'Irrigate (your land) and with-hold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits around the trees,' as meaning up to the ankles."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:551 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine. So he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Alláh thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him." The people asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?" He replied, "Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate."

Narrated by Asmá’ bint Abi Bakr {#3:552 .italic}

The Prophet prayed the eclipse prayer, and then said, "Hell was displayed so close that I said, 'O my Lord ! Am I going to be one of its inhabitants?"' Suddenly he saw a woman. I think he said, who was being scratched by a cat. He said, "What is wrong with her?" He was told, "She had imprisoned it (i.e. the cat) till it died of hunger."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:553 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "A woman was tortured and was put in Hell because of a cat which she had kept locked till it died of hunger." Alláh's Apostle further said, (Alláh knows better) Alláh said (to the woman), 'You neither fed it nor watered when you locked it up, nor did you set it free to eat the insects of the earth."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#3:554 .italic}

Once a tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to Alláh's Apostle who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the youngest of those who were present, and on his left side there were old men.

So, he gave it to the boy.

The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will drive some people out from my (sacred) Fount on the Day of Resurrection as strange camels are expelled from a private trough."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#3:556 .italic}

The Prophet said, "May Alláh be merciful to the mother of Ishmael! If she had left the water of Zam-Zam (fountain) as it was, (without constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, "If she had not taken handfuls of its water"), it would have been a flowing stream. Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and asked her, 'May we settle at your dwelling?' She said, 'Yes, but you have no right to possess the water.' They agreed."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:557 .italic}

The Prophet said, "There are three types of people whom Alláh will neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are): 1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered for his goods so much more than what he is given, 2. a man who takes a false oath after the 'Asr prayer in order to grab a Muslim's property, and 3. a man who with-holds his superfluous water. Alláh will say to him, "Today I will with-hold My Grace from you as you with-held the superfluity of what you had not created."

Narrated by As-Sab bin Jaththama {#3:558 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, No Hima except for Alláh and His Apostle. We have been told that Alláh's Apostle made a place called An-Naqi' as Hima, and ‘Umar made Ash-S_haraf and Ar-Rabadha Hima (for grazing the animals of Zakat).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:559 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Keeping horses may be a source of reward to some (man), a shelter to another (i.e. means of earning one's living), or a burden to a third. He to whom the horse will be a source of reward is the one who keeps it in Alláh's Cause (prepare it for holy battles) and ties it by a long rope in a pasture (or a garden). He will get a reward equal to what its long rope allows it to eat in the pasture or the garden, and if that horse breaks its rope and crosses one or two hills, then all its foot-steps and its dung will be counted as good deeds for its owner; and if it passes by a river and drinks from it, then that will also be regarded as a good deed for its owner even if he has had no intention of watering it then. Horses are a shelter from poverty to the second person who keeps horses for earning his living so as not to ask others, and at the same time he gives Alláh's right (i.e. Rakat) (from the wealth he earns through using them in trading etc.,) and does not overburden them. He who keeps horses just out of pride and for showing off and as a means of harming the Muslims, his horses will be a source of sins to him." When Alláh's Apostle was asked about donkeys, he replied, "Nothing particular was revealed to me regarding them except the general unique verse which is applicable to everything: "Whoever does goodness equal to the weight of an atom (or small ant) shall see it (its reward) on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by Zaid bin Khalid {#3:560 .italic}

A man came to Alláh's Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a fallen thing). The Prophet said, "Recognize its container and its tying material and then make a public announcement about it for one year and if its owner shows up, give it to him; otherwise use it as you like." The man said, "What about a lost sheep?" The Prophet said, "It is for you, your brother or the wolf." The man said "What about a lost camel?" The Prophet said, "Why should you take it as it has got its water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?"

Narrated by Az-Zubair bin Al 'Awwam {#3:561 .italic}

The Prophet said, "No doubt, one had better take a rope (and cut) and tie a bundle of wood and sell it whereby Alláh will keep his face away (from Hell-fire) rather than ask others who may give him or not."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:562 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "No doubt, you had better gather a bundle of wood and carry it on your back (and earn your living thereby) rather than ask somebody who may give you or not."

Narrated by Ḥusayn bin ‘Alí {#3:563 .italic}

‘Alí bin Abi Talib said: "I got a she-camel as my share of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and Alláh's Apostle gave me another she-camel. I let both of them kneel at the door of one of the Ansar, intending to carry Idhkhir on them to sell it and use its price for my wedding banquet on marrying Fatima. A goldsmith from Bam Qainqa' was with me. Hamza bin ‘Abdu’l-Muttalib was in that house drinking wine and a lady singer was reciting: "O Hamza! (Kill) the (two) fat old she camels (and serve them to your guests)." So Hamza took his sword and went towards the two she-camels and cut off their humps and opened their flanks and took a part of their livers." (I said to Ibn Shihab, "Did he take part of the humps?" He replied, "He cut off their humps and carried them away.") ‘Alí further said, "When I saw that dreadful sight, I went to the Prophet and told him the news. The Prophet came out in the company of Zaid bin Haritha who was with him then, and I too went with them. He went to Hamza and spoke harshly to him. Hamza looked up and said, 'Aren't you only the slaves of my forefathers?' The Prophet retreated and went out. This incident happened before the prohibition of drinking."

Narrated by Anas {#3:564 .italic}

The Prophet decided to grant a portion of (the uncultivated land of) Bahrain to the Ansar. The Ansar said, "(We will not accept it) till you give a similar portion to our emigrant brothers (from Quraish)." He said, "(O Ansar!) You will soon see people giving preference to others, so remain patient till you meet me (on the Day of Resurrection).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:565 .italic}

The Prophet said, "One of the rights of a she camel is that it should be milked at a place of water."

The Prophet permitted selling the dates of the 'Araya for ready dates by estimating the amount of the former (as they are still on the trees).

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#3:567 .italic}

The Prophet forbade the sales called Al-Mukhabara, Al-Muhaqala and Al-Muzabana and the selling of fruits till they are free from blights. He forbade the selling of the fruits except for money, except the 'Araya.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:568 .italic}

The Prophet allowed the sale of the dates of the 'Araya for ready dates by estimating the former which should be estimated as less than five Awsuq or five Awsuq. (Dawud, the sub-narrator is not sure as to the right amount.)

Narrated by Rafi 'bin Khadij and Sahl bin Al Hathma {#3:569 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle forbade the sale of Muzabana, i.e. selling of fruits for fruits, except in the case of 'Araya; he allowed the owners of 'Araya such kind of sale.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#3:570 .italic}

While I was in the company of the Prophet in one of his Ghazawat, he asked, "What is wrong with your camel? Will you sell it?" I replied in the affirmative and sold it to him. When he reached Medina, I took the camel to him in the morning and he paid me its price.

Narrated by Al-Amash {#3:571 .italic}

When we were with Ibrahim, we talked about mortgaging in deals of Salam. Ibrahim narrated from Aswad that 'Aisha had said, "The Prophet bought some foodstuff on credit from a Jew and mortgaged an iron armor to him."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:572 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever takes the money of the people with the intention of repaying it, Alláh will repay it on his behalf, and whoever takes it in order to spoil it, then Alláh will spoil him."

Narrated by Abu Dhar {#3:573 .italic}

Once, while I was in the company of the Prophet, he saw the mountain of Uhud and said, "I would not like to have this mountain turned into gold for me unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me for more than three days (i.e. I will spend all of it in Alláh's Cause), except that Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts." Then he said, "Those who are rich in this world would have little reward in the Hereafter except those who spend their money here and there (in Alláh's Cause), and they are few in number." Then he ordered me to stay at my place and went not far away. I heard a voice and intended to go to him but I remembered his order, "Stay at your place till I return."

He told them to take the fruits of my garden and exempt my father from the debts but they refused to do so. So, the Prophet did not give them my garden and told me that he would come to me the next morning. He came to us early in the morning and wandered among the datepalms and invoked Alláh to bless their fruits. I then plucked the dates and paid the creditors, and there remained some of the dates for us.

Alláh's Apostle entered the garden of the date-palms, wandering among the trees and ordered me (saying), "Pluck (the fruits) and give him his due." So, I plucked the fruits for him after the departure of Alláh's Apostle and gave his thirty Awsuq, and still had seventeen Awsuq extra for myself. Jabir said: I went to Alláh's Apostle to inform of what had happened, but found him praying the 'Asr prayer. After the prayer I told him about the extra fruits which remained.

When ‘Abdu’lláh (my father) died, he left behind children and debts. I asked the lenders to put down some of his debt, but they refused, so I went to the Prophet to intercede with them, yet they refused. The Prophet said (to me), "Classify your dates into their different kinds: 'Adhq bin Zaid, Lean and 'Ajwa, each kind alone and call all the creditors and wait till I come to you." I did so and the Prophet came and sat beside the dates and started measuring to each his due till he paid them fully, and the amount of dates remained as it was before, as if he had not touched them. (On another occasion) I took part in one of Ghazawat among with the Prophet and I was riding one of our camels. The camel got tired and was lagging behind the others. The Prophet hit it on its back. He said, "Sell it to me, and you have the right to ride it till Medina.'' When we approached Medina, I took the permission from the Prophet to go to my house, saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have newly married." The Prophet asked, "Have you married a virgin or a matron (a widow or divorcee)?" I said, "I have married a matron, as ‘Abdu’lláh (my father) died and left behind daughters small in their ages, so I married a matron who may teach them and bring them up with good manners." The Prophet then said (to me), "Go to your family." When I went there and told my maternal uncle about the selling of the camel, he admonished me for it. On that I told him about its slowness and exhaustion and about what the Prophet had done to the camel and his hitting it.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás {#3:648 .italic}

I had been eager to ask ‘Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Alláh said (in the Qur’án saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Alláh your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with ‘Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, "O Chief of the believers! ' Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Alláh said: 'If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, "I am astonished at your question, O Ibn ‘Abbás. They were Aisha and Hafsa." Then ‘Umar went on relating the narration and said. "I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in 'Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, 'Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Alláh, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.' What she said scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.' Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, 'Does any of you keep Alláh's Apostle angry all the day long till night?' She replied in the affirmative. I said, 'She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn't she fear that Alláh may get angry for the anger of Alláh's Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don't ask Alláh's Apostle too many things, and don't retort upon him in any case, and don't desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don't be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. 'Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Alláh's Apostle. In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Alláh's Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.' So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, 'Why are you weeping? Didn't I warn you? Have Alláh's Apostle divorced you all?' She replied, 'I don't know. He is there in the upper room.' I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: "Will you get the permission of (Alláh's Apostle) for ‘Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.' So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: "Will you get he permission for ‘Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, "Alláh's Apostle has granted you permission." So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: "Have you divorced your wives?' He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: "Will you heed what I say, 'O Alláh's Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them..." ‘Umar told the whole story (about his wife). "On that the Prophet smiled." ‘Umar further said, "I then said, 'I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion ('Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Alláh, I couldn't see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Alláh's Apostle) "Invoke Alláh to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Alláh?' The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, 'O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I asked the Prophet . 'Please ask Alláh's forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to 'Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Alláh admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, 'You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.' The Prophet said, 'The month is also of twenty-nine days.' That month consisted of twenty-nine days. 'Aisha said, 'When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, 'I am telling you something, but you needn't hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents." 'Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Alláh had said:-- 'O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, ... then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Alláh And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Alláh has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.' (33.28) 'Aisha said, 'Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Alláh, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.' After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as 'Aisha did."

Alláh's Apostle took an oath that he would not go to his wives for one month as his foot had been sprained. He stayed in an upper room when ‘Umar went to him and said, "Have you divorced your wives?"

Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes." Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; "O boy! Who is your father?" The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud only."

"Alláh's Apostle sent an army towards the east coast and appointed Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food was about to finish. Abú- 'Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu 'Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be one date only." I said, "How could one date benefit you?" Jabir replied, "We came to know its value when even that too finished." Jabir added, "When we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain.

They hurried and slaughtered the animals and put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till they were exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and Alláh stopped the camel with it. The Prophet said, "Some of these animals are like wild animals, so if you lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e. shoot it with an arrow)." Before distributing them among the soldiers my grandfather said, "We may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives; can we slaughter the animals with reeds?" The Prophet said, "Use whatever causes blood to flow, and eat the animals if the name of Alláh has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we should not imitate for they are infidels)."

When the latter needed water, they had to go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, 'Let us make a hole in our share of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them. So, if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be safe."

Her wealth and beauty may tempt him to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were ordered to marry any other woman." 'Aisha further said, "After that verse the people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan 'girls), so Alláh revealed the following verses:-- 'They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Alláh Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to marry..." (4.127) What is meant by Alláh's Saying:-- 'And about what is Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:-- 'If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, "Alláh's saying in the other verse:--'Yet whom you desire to marry' (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy)."

The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of the Ihram for'Umra and that we could finish our Ihram after performing the 'Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, "Shall we go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?" Jabir moved his hand while saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he delivered a sermon and said, "I have been informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Alláh I fear Alláh more than you do, and am more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hádí (sacrifice) with me and had the Hádí not been with me, I would have finished the Ihram." At that Suraqa bin Malik stood up and asked "O Alláh's Apostle! Is this permission for us only or is it forever?" The Prophet replied, "It is forever." In the meantime ‘Alí bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was saying Labbaik for what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, ‘Alí was saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Alláh's Apostle's). The Prophet told him to keep on the Ihram and let him share the Hádí with him.

My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, "We were in the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat in the pots and started cooking. Alláh's Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots, and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and) a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Alláh's Apostle said, 'Some of these animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then you should treat it as you have done now.' " My grandfather said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we slaughter the animals with reeds?" The Prophet said, "Yes, or you can use what would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of Alláh is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don't use teeth or fingernails (in slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Ḥadít_h 668)

No doubt, the Prophet mortgaged his armor for barley grams.

Muḥammad bin Maslama said, "How can we mortgage our women, and you are the most handsome among the Arabs?" He said, "Then mortgage your sons to me." Muḥammad said, "How can we mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them for being mortgaged for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we will mortgage our arms to you."

This verse was revealed about me. I had some dispute with another man regarding a well and we took the case before Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle said (to me), "Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).' I said, 'The defendant would not mind to take a false oath." Alláh's Apostle then said, 'Whoever took a false oath in order to grab someone else's property will meet Alláh, Alláh will be angry with him.' Alláh then revealed what Confirmed it." Al-Ash'ath then recited the following Verse:--"Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Alláh's covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!'

He replied, "The manumission of the most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master." I said, "If I cannot afford to do that?" He said, "Help the weak or do good for a person who cannot work for himself." I said, "If I cannot do that?"

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever frees his share of a common slave and he has sufficient money to free him completely, should let its price be estimated by a just man and give his partners the price of their shares and manumit the slave; otherwise (i.e. if he has not sufficient money) he manumits the slave partially."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:699 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever manumits his share of a slave, then it is essential for him to get that slave manumitted' completely as long as he has the money to do so.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:702 .italic}

That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or female slaves owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of the slave.

The Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! Your slave has come back." Abu Huraira said, "Indeed, I would like you to witness that I have manumitted him." That happened at the time when Abu Huraira recited (the following poetic verse):-- 'What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has delivered us From the land of Kufr (disbelief).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:708 .italic}

On my way to the Prophet I was reciting:-- 'What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has saved us From the land of Kufr (disbelief).' I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When I went to the Prophet and gave the pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the Prophet who remarked, "O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!" I said, "I manumit him for Alláh's Sake," and so I freed him.

This is the son of my brother 'Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody." 'Abu bin Zam'a said, "O Alláh's Apostle! He is my brother, the son of Zam'a' slave-girl and he was born on his bed." Alláh's Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and noticed much resemblance (to 'Utba). Alláh's Apostle said, "It is for you, O 'Abu bin Zam'a as he was born on the bed of your father." Alláh's Apostle then told Sauda bint Zam'a to observe veil in the presence of the boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to 'Utba and Sauda was the wife of the Prophet.

So, I manumitted her. The Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option of either staying with her husband or leaving him. She said, "Even if he gave me so much money, I would not stay with him," and so she preferred her freedom to her husband.

Narrated by Anas {#3:714 .italic}

What do you think about some good deeds I used to practice in the prelslamic period of ignorance regarding them as deeds of righteousness?' Alláh's Apostle said, "You have embraced Islam along with all those good deeds you did."

Narrated by Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama {#3:716 .italic}

When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the Prophet and they requested him to return their properties and captives. The Prophet stood up and said to them, "I have other people with me in this matter (as you see) and the most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the properties or the prisoners as I have delayed their distribution." The Prophet had waited for them for more than ten days since his arrival from Ta'if. So, when it became evident to them that the Prophet was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, "We choose our prisoners." The Prophet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Alláh as He deserved and said, "Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Alláh will give us, then he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives)." The people unanimously said, "We do that (return the captives) willingly." The Prophet said, "We do not know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back and let your leaders forward us your decision." So, all the people then went back and discussed the matter with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us about the captives of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that ‘Abbás said to the Prophet, "I paid for my ransom and Aqil's ransom."

No soul, (that which Alláh has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will definitely come, into existence."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:719 .italic}

I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tamim ever since I heard, three things, Alláh's Apostle said about them. I heard him saying, These people (of the tribe of Bani Tamim) would stand firm against Ad-Dajjal." When the Sadaqat (gifts of charity) from that tribe came, Alláh's Apostle said, "These are the Sadaqat (i.e. charitable gifts) of our folk." 'Aisha had a slave-girl from that tribe, and the Prophet said to 'Aisha, "Manumit her as she is a descendant of Ishmael (the Prophet)."

He replied, "Once I abused a man and he complained of me to the Prophet . The Prophet asked me, 'Did you abuse him by slighting his mother?' He added, 'Your slaves are your brethren upon whom Alláh has given you authority. So, if one has one's brethren under one's control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:729 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If one manumits his share of a common slave (Abd), and he has money sufficient to free the remaining portion of the price of the slave (justly estimated), then he should free the slave completely by paying the rest of his price; otherwise the slave is freed partly."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#3:730 .italic}

'Aisha said to her, "Go back to your masters, and if they agree that I will pay the amount of your writing of emancipation and get your Wala', I will do so." Buraira informed her masters of that but they refused and said, "If she (i.e. 'Aisha) is seeking Alláh's reward, then she can do so, but your Wala' will be for us." 'Aisha mentioned that to Alláh's Apostle who said to her, "Buy and manumit her, as the Wala' is for the liberator." Alláh's Apostle then got up and said, "What about the people who stipulate conditions which are not present in Alláh's Laws? Whoever imposes conditions which are not present in Alláh's Laws, then those conditions will be invalid, even if he imposed these conditions a hundred times. Alláh's conditions (Laws) are the truth and are more solid."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#3:736 .italic}

Aisha wanted to buy a slave-girl in order to manumit her. The girl's masters stipulated that her Wala' would be for them. Alláh's Apostle said (to 'Aisha), "What they stipulate should not stop you, for the Wala' is for the liberator."

Narrated by Aisha {#3:737 .italic}

Buraira came (to 'Aisha) and said, "I have made a contract of emancipation with my masters for nine Uqiyas (of gold) to be paid in yearly installments. Therefore, I seek your help." 'Aisha said, "If your masters agree, I will pay them the sum at once and free you on condition that your Wala' will be for me." Buraira went to her masters but they refused that offer. She (came back) and said, "I presented to them the offer but they refused, unless the Wala' was for them." Alláh's Apostle heard of that and asked me about it, and I told him about it. On that he said, "Buy and manumit her and stipulate that the Wala' should be for you, as Wala' is for the liberator." 'Aisha added, "Alláh's Apostle then got up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Alláh, and said, 'Then after: What about some people who impose conditions which are not present in Alláh's Laws? So, any condition which is not present in Alláh's Laws is invalid even if they were one-hundred conditions. Alláh's ordinance is the truth, and Alláh's condition is stronger and more solid. Why do some men from you say, O so-and-so! manumit the slave but the Wala will be for me? Verily, the Wala is for the liberator."

Narrated by Amra bint 'AbdurRahman {#3:738 .italic}

Buraira went to Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers to seek her help in her emancipation Aisha said to her, "If your masters agree, I will pay them your price in a lump sum and manumit you."

He said, "Buy and manumit her as the Wala' is for the liberator."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l- Wahid bin Aiman {#3:739 .italic}

I went to 'Aisha and said, "I was the slave of Utba bin Abu Lahab. "Utba died and his sons became my masters who sold me to Ibn Abu Amr who manumitted me. The sons of 'Utba stipulated that my Wala' should be for them." 'Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and she was given the writing of emancipation by her masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira told me that her masters would not sell her unless her Wala' was for them." 'Aisha said, "I am not in need of that." When the Prophet heard that, or he was told about it, he asked 'Aisha about it. 'Aisha mentioned what Buraira had told her. The Prophet said, "Buy and manumit her and let them stipulate whatever they like." So, 'Aisha bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her Wala' should be for them." The Prophet;, said, "The Wala' will be for the liberator even if they stipulated a hundred conditions."

That his father said, "One day I was sitting with some of the Prophet's companions on the way to Mecca. Alláh's Apostle was ahead of us. All of my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand over to me the whip and the spear but they said, 'No, by Alláh, we shall not help you in that in any way.' I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Alláh's Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, 'Do you have a portion of it with you?' I replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while he was in the state of Ihram.

But Alláh's Apostle gave the remaining milk to the bedouin and said twice, "The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the right side." Anas added, "It is a Sunna (the Prophet's traditions)" and repeated it thrice.

Ibn ‘Abbás said: Um Hufaid, Ibn ‘Abbás's aunt sent some dried yogurt (butter free), ghee (butter) and a mastigar to the Prophet as a gift. The Prophet ate the dried yogurt and butter but left the mastigar because he disliked it. Ibn ‘Abbás said, "The mastigar was eaten at the table of Alláh's Apostle and if it had been illegal to eat, it could not have been eaten at the table of Alláh's Apostle."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:750 .italic}

Whenever a meal was brought to Alláh's Apostle, he would ask whether it was a gift or Sadaqa (something given in charity). If he was told that it was Sadaqa, he would tell his companions to eat it, but if it was a gift, he would hurry to share it with them.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#3:751 .italic}

Some meat was brought to the Prophet and it was said that the meat had been given in charity to Buraira. He said, "It was Sadaqa for Buraira but a gift for us."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:752 .italic}

I intended to buy Buraira but her masters stipulated that her Wala should be for them. When the Prophet was told about it, he said to me, "Buy and manumit her, as the Wala' is for the liberator." Once Buraira was given some meat, and the Prophet asked, "What is this?" I said, "It has been given to Buraira in charity." He said, "It is sadaqa for her but a gift for us." Buraira was given the option (to stay with her husband or to part with him). AbdurRahman (a sub-narrator) wondered, "Was her husband a slave or a free man?" Shu'ba (another sub-narrator) said, "I asked 'Abdur-Rahman whether her husband was a slave or a free man. He replied that he did not know whether he was a slave or a free man."

Narrated by Um 'Atiyya {#3:753 .italic}

Once the Prophet went to 'Aisha and asked her whether she had something (to eat). She said that she had nothing except the mutton which Um 'Atiyya had sent to (Buraira) in charity. The Prophet said that it had reached its destination (i.e. it is no longer an object of charity.)

Narrated by 'Aisha {#3:754 .italic}

The people used to send gifts to the Prophet on the day of my turn. Um Salama said: "My companions (the wives of the Prophet Other than Aisha) gathered and they complained about it. So I informed the Prophet about it on their behalf, but he remained silent.

Narrated by 'Urwa from 'Aisha {#3:755 .italic}

The wives of Alláh's Apostle were in two groups. One group consisted of 'Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama and the other wives of Alláh's Apostle. The Muslims knew that Alláh's Apostle loved 'Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Alláh's Apostle, he would delay it, till Alláh's Apostle had come to 'Aisha's home and then he would send his gift to Alláh's Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and decided that Um Salama should request Alláh's Apostle to tell the people to send their gifts to him in whatever wife's house he was. Um Salama told Alláh's Apostle of what they had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She said, "He did not say anything to me." They asked her to talk to him again. She talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, "Talk to him till he gives you a reply." When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to her, "Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha." On that Um Salama said, "I repent to Alláh for hurting you." Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of Alláh's Apostle and sent her to Alláh's Apostle to say to him, "Your wives request to treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms." Then Fatima conveyed the message to him. The Prophet said, "O my daughter! Don't you love whom I love?" She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him and used harsh words saying, "Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms." On that she raised her voice and abused 'Aisha to her face so much so that Alláh's Apostle looked at 'Aisha to see whether she would retort. 'Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at 'Aisha and said, "She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr."

When he returned he said, "This (i.e. the Zakat) is for you and this has been given to my as a present." The Prophet said, "Why hadn't he stayed in his father's or mother's house to see whether he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a sheep, it will be bleating."

He said to them, "This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and the best statement to me is the true one, so you may choose one of two alternatives; either the captives or the property and (I have not distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you." When the Prophet had returned from Ta'if, he waited for them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the Muslims, Glorified and Praised Alláh as He deserved, and then said, "Then after: These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e. war booty) which Alláh will give us, then he can do so." The people said, "We return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and your leaders may present your decision to me." The people went away, and their leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly.

Abu Bakr was sitting with Alláh's Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin Al-'As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, "O Abu Bakr! Do you hear what this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet ?"

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Mulaika from 'Uqba bin Al-Harith {#3:808 .italic}

Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin ‘Azíz, and then a woman came and said, "I suckled 'Uqba and his wife." 'Uqba said to her, "I do not know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me." He then sent someone to the house of Abu Ihab to enquire about that but they did not know that she had suckled their daughter. Then 'Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it. The Prophet said to him, "How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that both of you were suckled by the same woman)?" So, he divorced her and she was married to another (husband).

Narrated by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab {#3:809 .italic}

People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine Inspiration during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle but now there is no longer any more (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you practice publicly, so we will trust and favor the one who does good deeds in front of us, and we will not call him to account about what he is really doing in secret, for Alláh will judge him for that; but we will not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he claims that his intentions were good.

He said, "I have said what the Prophet said. He said, 'Alláh will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good character is attested by four persons.'

Narrated by Aisha {#3:829 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) "Whenever Alláh's Apostle intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Alláh had decreed the use of the veil by women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When Alláh's Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city of Medina, Alláh's Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Mu'attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me, and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, "Inna lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Alláh, and we will return to Him)." He made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the leader of the false accusers was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got sick. But he would come, greet and say, 'How is that (girl)?' I did not know anything of what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old 'Arabs in the open country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined.' I said, 'You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of) Badr?' She said, 'O Hanata (you there) didn't you hear what they said?' Then she told me the rumors of the false accusers. My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home, Alláh's Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, 'How is that (girl)?' I requested him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I Alláh's Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, 'What are the people talking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry much about this matter. By Alláh, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the women would forge false news about her.' I said, 'Glorified be Alláh! Are the people really taking of this matter?' That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till morning. In the morning Alláh's Apostle called ‘Alí bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e. 'Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Alláh, we know nothing about her but good.' ‘Alí bin Abu Talib said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh has no imposed restrictions on you, and there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that Alláh's Apostle called Buraira and said, 'O Burair. Did you ever see anything which roused your suspicions about her?' Buraira said, 'No, by Alláh Who has sent you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.' On that day Alláh's Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul. Alláh's Apostle said, 'Who will support me to punish that person (‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my family? By Alláh, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my company.' Sad bin Mu'adh got up and said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! by Alláh, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that Sad bin 'Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said, 'By Alláh, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill him.' On that Usaid bin Al-Hádír got up and said (to Sad bin 'Ubada), 'By Alláh! you are a liar. By Alláh, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.' On this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other, while Alláh's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quietened them till they became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Alláh's Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and Muḥammad is His Apostle) and then said, 'O 'Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you are innocent, then Alláh will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Alláh and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and asks Alláh for forgiveness, Alláh accepts his repentance.' When Alláh's Apostle finished his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I requested my father to reply to Alláh's Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Alláh, I do not know what to say to Alláh's Apostle.' I said to my mother, 'Talk to Alláh's Apostle on my behalf.' She said, 'By Alláh, I do not know what to say to Alláh's Apostle. I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the Qur’án. I said. 'I know, by Alláh, that you have listened to what people are saying and that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you that I am innocent and Alláh knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Alláh knows that I am innocent you would believe me. By Alláh, I don't compare my situation with you except to the situation of Joseph's father (i.e. Jacob) who said, 'So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Alláh (Alone) whose help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side of my bed hoping that Alláh would prove my innocence. By Alláh I never thought that Alláh would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior to be talked of in the Holy Qur’án. I had hoped that Alláh's Apostle might have a dream in which Alláh would prove my innocence. By Alláh, Alláh's Apostle had not got up and nobody had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Alláh's Apostle. So, there overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Alláh's Apostle was over, he was smiling and the first word he said, 'Aisha! Thank Alláh, for Alláh has declared your innocence.' My mother told me to go to Alláh's Apostle . I replied, 'By Alláh I will not go to him and will not thank but Alláh.' So Alláh revealed: "Verily! They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . ." (24.11) When Alláh gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr, who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, 'By Alláh, I will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.' But Alláh later revealed: -- "And let not those who are good and wealthy among you swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Alláh's Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Alláh should forgive you? Verily! Alláh is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful." (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said, 'Yes ! By Alláh! I like that Alláh should forgive me,' and resumed helping Mistah whom he used to help before. Alláh's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the Prophet's wife about me saying, 'What do you know and what did you see?' She replied, 'O Alláh's Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By Alláh, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha." Aisha further added "Zainab was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet's love), yet Alláh protected her (from being malicious), for she had piety."

So, I went to Ibn ‘Abbás and asked him. He replied, "Moses completed the longer and better period." Ibn ‘Abbás added, "No doubt, an apostle of Alláh always does what he says."

Narrated by Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdu’lláh bin Utba {#3:850 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "O Muslims? How do you ask the people of the Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Qur’án) which was revealed to His Prophet is the most recent information from Alláh and you recite it, the Book that has not been distorted? Alláh has revealed to you that the people of the scriptures have changed with their own hands what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed Scriptures): This is from Alláh, in order to get some worldly benefit thereby." Ibn ‘Abbás added: "Isn't the knowledge revealed to you sufficient to prevent you from asking them? By Alláh I have never seen any one of them asking (Muslims) about what has been revealed to you."

Narrated by An-Nu'man bin Bashir {#3:851 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The example of the person abiding by Alláh's orders and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations prescribed by Alláh) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate Alláh's limits and orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some of them got seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have to pass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and started making a hole in the bottom of the boat. The people of the upper part came and asked him, (saying), 'What is wrong with you?' He replied, "You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have to get water.' Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves, but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy him and themselves."

Narrated by Um Al-Ala {#3:852 .italic}

That when the Ansar drew lots as to which of the emigrants should dwell with which of the Ansar, the name of Uthman bin Mazun came out (to be in their lot). Um Al-Ala further said, "Uthman stayed with us, and we nursed him when he got sick, but he died. We shrouded him in his clothes, and Alláh's Apostle came to our house and I said, (addressing the dead 'Uthman), 'O Abu As-Sa'ib! May Alláh be merciful to you. I testify that Alláh has blessed you.' The Prophet said to me, "How do you know that Alláh has blessed him?" I replied, 'I do not know O Alláh's Apostle! May my parents be sacrificed for you.' Alláh's Apostle said, 'As regards Uthman, by Alláh he has died and I really wish him every good, yet, by Alláh, although I am Alláh's Apostle, I do not know what will be done to him.' Um Al-Ala added, 'By Alláh I shall never attest the piety of anybody after him. And what Alláh's Apostles said made me sad." Um Al-Ala further said, "Once I slept and saw in a dream, a flowing stream for Uthman. So I went to Alláh's Apostle and told him about it, he said, 'That is (the symbol of) his deeds."

Narrated by Aisha {#3:853 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot fell. He also used to fix for everyone of his wives a day and a night, but Sauda bint Zam'a gave her day and night to 'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet intending thereby to please Alláh's Apostle.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:854 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "If the people knew what is the reward of making the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except by casting lots, they would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew the reward of the noon prayer, they would race for it, and if they knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there.

## Volume 3, Book 49

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#3:855 .italic}

There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in order to make peace between them. The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up; Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, "The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?" Abu Bakr replied, "Yes, you wish." So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him. The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised his hand and praised Alláh and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the prayer, he turned towards the people and said, "O people! When something happens to you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: 'Subhan Alláh', (Glorified be Alláh), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned to you (to continue)?" Abu Bakr replied, "It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet.

Narrated by Anas {#3:856 .italic}

It was said to the Prophet "Would that you see ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai." So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai, the latter said, "Keep away from me! By Alláh, the bad smell of your donkey has harmed me." On that an Ansari man said (to ‘Abdu’lláh), "By Alláh! The smell of the donkey of Alláh's Apostle is better than your smell." On that a man from ‘Abdu’lláh's tribe got angry for ‘Abdu’lláh's sake, and the two men abused each other which caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in this concern):-- "And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace between them." (49.9)

A bedouin came and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Judge between us according to Alláh's Laws." His opponent got up and said, "He is right. Judge between us according to Alláh's Laws." The bedouin said, "My son was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the learned scholars who said, "Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to be exiled for one year." The Prophet said, "No doubt I will judge between you according to Alláh's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile." He then addressed somebody, "O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death" So, Unais went and stoned her to death.

Narrated by Al-Bara bin 'Azib {#3:862 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the people of Hudaibiya, ‘Alí bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it, "Muḥammad, Alláh's Apostle ." The pagans said, "Don't write: 'Muḥammad, Alláh's Apostle', for if you were an apostle we would not fight with you." Alláh's Apostle asked ‘Alí to rub it out, but ‘Alí said, "I will not be the person to rub it out." Alláh's Apostle rubbed it out and made peace with them on the condition that the Prophet and his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that they would enter with their weapons in cases.

Narrated by Al-Bara {#3:863 .italic}

When the Prophet intended to perform 'Umra in the month of Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was written, the following was mentioned: 'These are the terms on which Muḥammad, Alláh's Apostle agreed (to make peace).' They said, "We will not agree to this, for if we believed that you are Alláh's Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh." The Prophet said, "I am Alláh's Apostle and also Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh." Then he said to ‘Alí, "Rub off (the words) 'Alláh's Apostle' ", but ‘Alí said, "No, by Alláh, I will never rub off your name." So, Alláh's Apostle took the document and wrote, 'This is what Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh has agreed upon: No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the latter wants to stay.' When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the Meccans went to ‘Alí and said, "Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as the period (agreed to) has passed." So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, "O Uncle! O Uncle!" ‘Alí received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, "Take your uncle's daughter." Zaid and Ja'far quarrel ed about her. ‘Alí said, "I have more right to her as she is my uncle's daughter." Ja'far said, "She is my uncle's daughter, and her aunt is my wife." Zaid said, "She is my brother's daughter." The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the aunt was like the mother. He then said to 'All, "You are from me and I am from you", and said to Ja'far, "You resemble me both in character and appearance", and said to Zaid, "You are our brother (in faith) and our freed slave."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:864 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle set out for the 'Umra but the pagans of Quraish prevented him from reaching the Ka'ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform 'Umra the following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca except for the period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the 'Umra in the following year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed.

Ar-Rabi, the daughter of An-Nadr broke the tooth of a girl, and the relatives of Ar-Rabi' requested the girl's relatives to accept the Irsh (compensation for wounds etc.) and forgive (the offender), but they refused. So, they went to the Prophet who ordered them to bring about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked, "O Alláh"; Apostle! Will the tooth of Ar-Rabi' be broken? No, by Him Who has sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken." The Prophet said, "O Anas! Alláh"; law ordains retaliation." Later the relatives of the girl agreed and forgave her. The Prophet said, "There are some of Alláh's slaves who, if they take an oath by Alláh, are responded to by Alláh i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas added, "The people agreed and accepted the Irsh."

Narrated by Al-Ḥasan Al-Basri {#3:867 .italic}

By Alláh, Al-Ḥasan bin ‘Alí led large battalions like mountains against Muawiya. Amr bin Al-As said (to Muawiya), "I surely see battalions which will not turn back before killing their opponents." Muawiya who was really the best of the two men said to him, "O 'Amr! If these killed those and those killed these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for their women, who would be left with me for their children?" Then Muawiya sent two Quraishi men from the tribe of 'Abd-i-Shams called 'Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Ḥasan saying to them, "Go to this man (i.e. Al-Ḥasan) and negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him." So, they went to Al-Ḥasan and talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Ḥasan said, "We, the offspring of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and money only will appease them)." They said to Al-Ḥasan, "Muawiya offers you so and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace." Al-Ḥasan said to them, "But who will be responsible for what you have said?" They said, "We will be responsible for it." So, what-ever Al-Ḥasan asked they said, "We will be responsible for it for you." So, Al-Ḥasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya. Al-Ḥasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, "I saw Alláh's Apostle on the pulpit and Al-Ḥasan bin ‘Alí was by his side. The Prophet was looking once at the people and once at Al-Ḥasan bin ‘Alí saying, 'This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may Alláh make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him."

Narrated by Aisha {#3:868 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle heard the loud voices of some opponents quarreling at the door. One of them was appealing to the other to deduct his debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying, "By Alláh I will not do so." Alláh's Apostle went out to them and said, "Who is the one who was swearing by Alláh that he would not do a favor?" That man said, "I am that person, O Alláh's Apostle! I will give my opponent whatever he wishes."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Kab bin Malik from Kab bin Malik {#3:869 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Kab bin Malik some money. One day the latter met the former and demanded his right, and their voices grew very loud. The Prophet passed by them and said, "O Ka'b," beckoning with his hand as if intending to say, "Deduct half the debts." So, Kab took half what the other owed him and remitted the other half.

Narrated by Urwa bin Az-Zubair {#3:871 .italic}

Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Alláh's Apostle about a water stream which both of them used for irrigation. Alláh's Apostle said to Az-Zubair, "O Zubair! Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor." The Ansari became angry and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Is it because he is your cousin?" On that the complexion of Alláh's Apostle changed (because of anger) and said (to Az-Zubair), "I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till it reaches the walls (surrounding the palms)." So, Alláh's Apostle gave Az-Zubair his full right. Before that Alláh's Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Alláh's Apostle he gave Az-Zubair his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, "By Alláh ! I think the following Verse was revealed concerning that case: "But no by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them." (4.65)

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#3:872 .italic}

My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me), "When you pluck the dates and collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Alláh's Apostle)." Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and sat on the dates and invoked Alláh to bless them. Then he said, "Call your creditors and give them their full rights." So, I paid all my father's creditors in full and yet thirteen extra Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were 'Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Alláh's Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On that he smiled and said, "Go to Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and tell them about it." They said, "We perceived that was going to happen, as Alláh's Apostle did what he did."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Kab {#3:873 .italic}

That Ka'b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle he demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices grew louder till Alláh's Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he lifted the curtain of his room and called Ka'b bin Malik saying, "O Ka'b!" He replied, "Labbaik! O Alláh's Apostle!" He beckoned to him with his hand suggesting that he deduct half the debt. Ka'b said, "I agree, O Alláh's Apostle!" Alláh's Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad), "Get up and pay him the rest."

## Volume 3, Book 50

Narrated by Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama {#3:874 .italic}

(from the companions of Alláh's Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to the Treaty (of Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was that the Prophet should return to them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and would not interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin 'Amr. Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum bint Uqba bin Abu Muait who came to Alláh's Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her relative came to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for Alláh had revealed the following Verse regarding women: "O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine them, Alláh knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers, Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10) Narrated 'Urwa: Aisha told me, "Alláh's Apostle used to examine them according to this Verse: "O you who believe! When the believing women come to you, as emigrants test them . . . for Alláh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (60.10-12) Aisha said, "When any of them agreed to that condition Alláh's Apostle would say to her, 'I have accepted your pledge of allegiance.' He would only say that, but, by Alláh he never touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking the pledge of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words (only)."

Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for emancipation and at that time she had not paid any part of her price. 'Aisha said to her, "Go to your masters and if they agree that I will pay your price (and free you) on condition that your Wala' will be for me, I will pay the money." Buraira told her masters about that, but they refused, and said, "If 'Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but your Wala will be for us." Aisha informed Alláh's Apostle of that and he said to her, "Buy and manumit Buraira as the Wala' will go to the manumitted."

Narrated by Jabir {#3:879 .italic}

While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and beat it and prayed for Alláh's Blessings for it. The camel became so fast as it had never been before. The Prophet then said, "Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I said, "No." He again said, "Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold)." I sold it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that camel to the Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me (and when I went to him) he said, "I will not take your camel. Take your camel as a gift for you." (Various narrations are mentioned here with slight variations in expressions relating the condition that Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to Medina).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:880 .italic}

We used to work on the fields more than the other Ansar, and we used to rent the land (for the yield of a specific portion of it). But sometimes that portion or the rest of the land did not give any yield, so we were forbidden (by the Prophet ) to follow such a system, but we were allowed to rent the land for money.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#3:884 .italic}

The Prophet said, "No town-dweller should sell for a bedouin. Do not practice Najsh (i.e. Do not offer a high price for a thing which you do not want to buy, in order to deceive the people). No Muslim should offer more for a thing already bought by his Muslim brother, nor should he demand the hand of a girl already engaged to another Muslim. A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorce of her sister (i.e. another Muslim woman) in order to take her place herself."

Narrated by Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani {#3:885 .italic}

A bedouin came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's apostle! I ask you by Alláh to judge My case according to Alláh's Laws." His opponent, who was more learned than he, said, "Yes, judge between us according to Alláh's Laws, and allow me to speak." Alláh's Apostle said, "Speak." He (i .e. the bedouin or the other man) said, "My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death." Alláh's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Alláh's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt, stone her to death." Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Alláh's Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death.

Buy me and manumit me, as my masters will sell me." Aisha agreed to it. Buraira said, 'My masters will sell me on the condition that my Wala will go to them." Aisha said to her, 'Then I am not in need of you.' The Prophet heard of that or was told about it and so he asked Aisha, 'What is the problem of Buraira?' He said, 'Buy her and manumit her, no matter what they stipulate.' Aisha added, 'I bought and manumitted her, though her masters had stipulated that her Wala would be for them.' The Prophet said, The Wala is for the liberator, even if the other stipulated a hundred conditions."

Narrated by Ubai bin Kab {#3:888 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Moses the Apostle of Alláh," and then he narrated the whole story about him. Al-Khadir said to Moses, "Did not I tell you that you can have no patience with me." (18.72). Moses then violated the agreement for the first time because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything, the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to be applied. The three occasions referred to above are referred to by the following Verses: "Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me." (18.73) "Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him." (18.74) "Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the verge of falling and Khadir set it up straight." (18.77)

Aisha said, "Buraira came to me and said, 'My people (masters) have written the contract for my emancipation for nine Awaq ) of gold) to be paid in yearly installments, one Uqiyya per year; so help me." Aisha said (to her), "If your masters agree, I will pay them the whole sum provided the Wala will be for me." Buraira went to her masters and told them about it, but they refused the offer and she returned from them while Alláh's Apostles was sitting. She said, "I presented the offer to them, but they refused unless the Wala' would be for them." When the Prophet heard that and 'Aisha told him about It, he said to her, "Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that her Wala' will be for them, as the Wala' is for the manumitted." 'Aisha did so. After that Alláh's Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Alláh and said, "What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Alláh's Laws? Any condition which is not in Alláh's Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such conditions. Alláh's Rules are the most valid and Alláh's Conditions are the most solid. The Wala is for the manumitted."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#3:890 .italic}

When the people of Khaibar dislocated ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar's hands and feet, ‘Umar got up delivering a sermon saying, "No doubt, Alláh's Apostle made a contract with the Jews concerning their properties, and said to them, 'We allow you (to stand in your land) as long as Alláh allows you.' Now ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar went to his land and was attacked at night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my mind to exile them." When ‘Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu Al-Haqiq's came and addressed ‘Umar, "O chief of the believers, will you exile us although Muḥammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?" ‘Umar said, "Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Alláh's Apostle, i.e.: What will your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you night after night?" The Jew replied, "That was joke from Abu-l-Qasim." ‘Umar said, "O the enemy of Alláh! You are telling a lie." ‘Umar then drove them out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel saddles and ropes, etc."

Narrated by Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan {#3:891 .italic}

(whose narrations attest each other) Alláh's Apostle set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, "Khalid bin Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right." By Alláh, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, "Al-Qaswa' (i.e. the she-camel's name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa' has become stubborn!" The Prophet said, "Al-Qaswa' has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant." Then he said, "By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will respect the ordinances of Alláh, I will grant it to them." The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water and complained to Alláh's Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Alláh, the water started and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza'i came with some persons from his tribe Khuza'a and they were the advisers of Alláh's Apostle who would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, "I left Kab bin Luai and 'Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba." Alláh's Apostle said, "We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the 'Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e. the ‘Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Alláh in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Alláh will definitely make His Cause victorious." Budail said, "I will inform them of what you have said." So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said, "We have come from that man (i.e. Muḥammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to you if you should like." Some of the fools among Quraish shouted that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said, "Relate what you heard him saying." Budail said, "I heard him saying so-and-so," relating what the Prophet had told him. Urwa bin Mas'ud got up and said, "O people! Aren't you the sons? They said, "Yes." He added, "Am I not the father?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Do you mistrust me?" They said, "No." He said, "Don't you know that I invited the people of 'Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a reasonable proposal, you'd better accept it and allow me to meet him." They said, "You may meet him." So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, "O Muḥammad! Won't you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Alláh, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone." Hearing that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, "Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?" Urwa said, "Who is that man?" They said, "He is Abu Bakr." Urwa said to Abu Bakr, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you." Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet's beard as he was talking while Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), "Remove your hand from the beard of Alláh's Apostle." Urwa raised his head and asked, "Who is that?" The people said, "He is Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba." Urwa said, "O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?" Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him, "As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Alláh, whenever Alláh's Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to his people and said, "O people! By Alláh, I have been to the kings and to Caesar, Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as much as Muḥammad is respected by his companions. By Alláh, if he spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet's companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect." Urwa added, "No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so please accept it." A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, "Allow me to go to him," and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his companions, Alláh's Ap le I said, "He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of him." So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, "Glorified be Alláh! It is not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka'ba." When he returned to his people, he said, 'I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the Ka'ba." Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to go to Muḥammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet said, "Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man." Mikraz started talking to the Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, "Now the matter has become easy." Suhail said to the Prophet "Please conclude a peace treaty with us." So, the Prophet called the clerk and said to him, "Write: By the Name of Alláh, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful." Suhail said, "As for 'Beneficent,' by Alláh, I do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Alláh, as you used to write previously." The Muslims said, "By Alláh, we will not write except: By the Name of Alláh, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful." The Prophet said, "Write: By Your Name O Alláh." Then he dictated, "This is the peace treaty which Muḥammad, Alláh's Apostle has concluded." Suhail said, "By Alláh, if we knew that you are Alláh's Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with you. So, write: "Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh." The Prophet said, "By Alláh! I am Apostle of Alláh even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh." (Az-Zuhri said, "The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Alláh, (i.e. by letting him and his companions perform 'Umra.)" The Prophet said to Suhail, "On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka'ba) so that we may perform Tawaf around it." Suhail said, "By Alláh, we will not (allow you this year) so as not to give chance to the 'Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we will allow you next year." So, the Prophet got that written. Then Suhail said, "We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us, even if he embraced your religion." The Muslims said, "Glorified be Alláh! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim? While they were in this state Abú- Jandal bin Suhail bin 'Amr came from the valley of Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, "O Muḥammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall return Abu Jandal to me." The Prophet said, "The peace treaty has not been written yet." Suhail said, "I will never allow you to keep him." The Prophet said, "Yes, do." He said, "I won't do.: Mikraz said, "We allow you (to keep him)." Abu Jandal said, "O Muslims! Will I be returned to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don't you see how much I have suffered?" Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Alláh. ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "I went to the Prophet and said, 'Aren't you truly the Apostle of Alláh?' The Prophet said, 'Yes, indeed.' I said, 'Isn't our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our religion?' He said, 'I am Alláh's Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.' I said, 'Didn't you tell us that we would go to the Ka'ba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the Ka'ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'So you will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?' " ‘Umar further said, "I went to Abu Bakr and said, 'O Abu Bakr! Isn't he truly Alláh's Prophet?' He replied, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we be humble in our religion?' He said, 'Indeed, he is Alláh's Apostle and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by Alláh, he is on the right.' I said, 'Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba and perform Tawaf around it?' He said, 'Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the Ka'ba this year?' I said, 'No.' He said, "You will go to Ka'ba and perform Tawaf around it." (Az-Zuhri said, " ‘Umar said, 'I performed many good deeds as expiation for the improper questions I asked them.' ") When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Alláh's Apostle said to his companions, "Get up and' slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved." By Alláh none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people's attitudes towards him. Um Salama said, "O the Prophet of Alláh! Do you want your order to be carried out? Go out and don't say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head." So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet ); and Alláh revealed the following Divine Verses:-- "O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them . . ." (60.10) ‘Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya married the other. When the Prophet returned to Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), "Abide by the promise you gave us." So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to one of them, "By Alláh, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword." The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, "By Alláh, it is very fine and I have tried it many times." Abu Bair said, "Let me have a look at it." When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Alláh's Apostle saw him he said, "This man appears to have been frightened." When he reached the Prophet he said, "My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too." Abu Basir came and said, "O Alláh's Apostle, by Alláh, Alláh has made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Alláh has saved me from them." The Prophet said, "Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he would be, should he only have supporters." When Abu Basir heard that he understood that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till they formed a strong group. By Alláh, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him for the Sake of Alláh and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions) promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir's companions) and Alláh I revealed the following Divine Verses: "And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had pride and haughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance." (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muḥammad) was the Prophet of Alláh and refused to write: "In the Name of Alláh, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful," and prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka'ba. Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, "Aisha told me that Alláh's Apostle used to examine the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Alláh revealed the order that the Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their wives, ‘Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza'i. Later on Mu'awlya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the other." When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Alláh revealed: "And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr)." (60.11) So, Alláh ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands. We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to return Abu Basir.

Aisha said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation. 'Aisha said to her, "If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala' will be for me." When Alláh's Apostle came, she told him about it. The Prophet said to her, "Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits." Then Alláh's Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, "What about those people who stipulate conditions which are not in Alláh's Laws? Whoever stipulates such conditions as are not in Alláh's Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he stipulated a hundred such conditions."

‘Umar bin Khattab got some land in Khaibar and he went to the Prophet to consult him about it saying, "O Alláh' Apostle got some land in Khaibar better than which I have never had, what do you suggest that I do with it?" The Prophet said, "If you like you can give the land as endowment and give its fruits in charity." So ‘Umar gave it in charity as an endowment on the condition that would not be sold nor given to anybody as a present and not to be inherited, but its yield would be given in charity to the poor people, to the Kith and kin, for freeing slaves, for Alláh's Cause, to the travelers and guests; and that there would be no harm if the guardian of the endowment ate from it according to his need with good intention, and fed others without storing it for the future."

I asked ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Aufa "Did the Prophet make a will?" He replied, "No," I asked him, "How is it then that the making of a will has been enjoined on people, (or that they are ordered to make a will)?" He replied, "The Prophet bequeathed Alláh's Book (i.e. Qur’án)."

In the presence of 'Aisha some people mentioned that the Prophet had appointed ‘Alí by will as his successor. 'Aisha said, "When did he appoint him by will? Verily when he died he was resting against my chest (or said: in my lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, and I could not even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?"

Narrated by Sad bin Abu Waqqas {#4:5 .italic}

The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca, ('Amir the sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had already migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sad bin Khaula)." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! May I will all my property (in charity)?" He said, "No." I said, "Then may I will half of it?" He said, "No". I said, "One third?" He said: "Yes, one third, yet even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Alláh's sake will be considered as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife's mouth. Alláh may lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by you." At that time Sad had only one daughter.

I said, "I want to will my property, and I have only one daughter and I want to will half of my property (to be given in charity)." He said," Half is too much." I said, "Then I will one third." He said, "One-third, yet even one-third is too much." (The narrator added, "So the people started to will one third of their property and that was Permitted for them.")

(the wife of the Prophet) Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted (his son) to his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, "The son of the slave-girl of Zam'a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody." So during the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad took the boy and said, "This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me." 'Abu bin Zam's got up and said, "He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father and was born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Alláh's Apostle and Sad said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This is my brother's son whom my brother entrusted to me." Then 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father." Alláh's Apostle said, "O Abu bin Zam'a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation)." Then the Prophet said to his wife Sauda bint Zam'a, "Screen yourself from this boy," when he saw the boy's resemblance to 'Utba. Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died.

The custom (in old days) was that the property of the deceased would be inherited by his offspring; as for the parents (of the deceased), they would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Alláh cancelled from that custom whatever He wished and fixed for the male double the amount inherited by the female, and for each parent a sixth (of the whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the husband a half or a fourth.

A man asked the Prophet, "O Alláh's Apostle! What kind of charity is the best?" He replied. "To give in charity when you are healthy and greedy hoping to be wealthy and afraid of becoming poor. Don't delay giving in charity till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, 'Give so much to so-and-so and so much to so-and so,' and at that time the property is not yours but it belongs to so-and-so (i.e. your inheritors)."

Ḥakím bin Hizam said, "I asked Alláh's Apostle for something, and he gave me, and I asked him again and he gave me and said, 'O Ḥakím! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as tempting as fruits), and whoever takes it with The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e. taking) hand." Ḥakím added, "I said, O Alláh's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you till I die." Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Ḥakím to give him something but he refused to accept anything from him. Then ‘Umar called him to give him (something) but he refused. Then ‘Umar said, "O Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Ḥakím) his share which Alláh has ordained for him from this booty and he refuses to take it." Thus Ḥakím did not ask anybody for anything after the Prophet, till he died--may Alláh bestow His mercy upon him.

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "All of you are guardians and responsible for your charges: the Ruler (i.e. Imam) is a guardian and responsible for his subjects; and a man is a guardian of his family and is responsible for his charges; and a lady is a guardian in the house of her husband and is responsible for her charge; and a servant is a guardian of the property of his master and is responsible for his charge." I think he also said, "And a man is a guardian of the property of his father."

(26.214) Was revealed, the Prophet started calling the various big families of Quraish, "O Bani Fihr! O Bani Adi!". Abu Huraira said, "When the Verse: "Warn your nearest kinsmen" was revealed, the Prophet said (in a loud voice), "O people of Quraish!"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:16 .italic}

When Alláh revealed the Verse: "Warn your nearest kinsmen," Alláh's Apostle got up and said, "O people of Quraish (or said similar words)!

I cannot save you from Alláh's Punishment; O Fatima bint Muḥammad! Ask me anything from my wealth, but I cannot save you from Alláh's Punishment."

Some people claim that the order in the above Verse is cancelled, by Alláh, it is not cancelled, but the people have stopped acting on it. There are two kinds of guardians (who are in charge of the inheritance): One is that who inherits; such a person should give (of what he inherits to the relatives, the orphans and the needy, etc.), the other is that who does not inherit (e.g. the guardian of the orphans): such a person should speak kindly and say (to those who are present at the time of distribution), "I can not give it to you (as the wealth belongs to the orphans)."

A man said to the Prophet, "My mother died suddenly, and I think that if she could speak, she would have given in charity. May I give in charity on her behalf?" He said, "Yes! Give in charity on her behalf."

That the mother of Sad bin Ubada the brother of Bani Saida died in Sad's absence, so he came to the Prophet saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! My mother died in my absence, will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?" The Prophet said, "Yes." Sad said, "I take you as my witness that I give my garden Al-Makhraf in charity on her behalf."

Narrated by Az-Zuhri {#4:25 .italic}

Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the Qur’ánic Verse:-- "And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice." (4.2-3) Aisha said, "It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth, and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people asked Alláh's Apostle about it. So Alláh revealed the following Verse:-- "They ask your instruction (O Muḥammad!) regarding women. Say: Alláh instructs you regarding them..." (4.127) and in this Verse Alláh indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:26 .italic}

In the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle , ‘Umar gave in charity some of his property, a garden of date-palms called Thamgh. ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity." The Prophet; said, "Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity." So ‘Umar gave it in charity, and it was for Alláh's Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no intention of becoming wealthy by its means.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:27 .italic}

The following Verse: "If a guardian is well-off, let him claim no remuneration (i.e. wages), but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable." (4.6) was revealed in connection with the guardian of an orphan, and it means that if he is poor he can have for himself (from the orphan's wealth) what is just and reasonable according to the orphan's share of the inheritance.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:28 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Avoid the seven great destructive sins." The people enquire, "O Alláh's Apostle! What are they? "He said, "To join others in worship along with Alláh, to practice sorcery, to kill the life which Alláh has forbidden except for a just cause, (according to Islamic law), to eat up Riba (usury), to eat up an orphan's wealth, to give back to the enemy and fleeing from the battlefield at the time of fighting, and to accuse, chaste women, who never even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers.

When Alláh's Apostle came to Medina; he did not have any servant. Abu Talha (Anas' step-father) took me to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Anas is a wise boy, so let him serve you." So, I served him at home and on journeys. If I did anything, he never asked me why I did it, and if I refrained from doing anything, he never asked me why I refrained from doing it.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:30 .italic}

Abu Talha had the greatest wealth of date-palms amongst the Ansar in Medina, and he prized above all his wealth (his garden) Bairuha', which was situated opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet ). The Prophet used to enter It and drink from its fresh water. When the following Divine Verse came:-- "By no means shall you attain piety until you spend of what you love," (3.92) Abu Talha got up saying. "O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh says, 'You will not attain piety until you spend of what you love,' and I prize above al I my wealth, Bairuha' which I want to give in charity for Alláh's Sake, hoping for its reward from Alláh. So you can use it as Alláh directs you." On that the Prophet said, "Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives." On that Abu Talha said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I will do (as you have suggested)." So, Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:31 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If you wish you can keep it as an endowment to be used for charitable purposes." So, ‘Umar gave the land in charity (i.e. as an endowments on the condition that the land would neither be sold nor given as a present, nor bequeathed, (and its yield) would be used for the poor, the kinsmen, the emancipation of slaves, Jihad, and for guests and travelers; and its administrator could eat in a reasonable just manner, and he also could feed his friends without intending to be wealthy by its means."

So ‘Umar gave it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) the yield of which was to be used for the good of the poor, the needy, the kinsmen and the guests.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:35 .italic}

My father was martyred on the day (of the Ghazwa) of Uhud and left six daughters and some debts to be paid. When the time of plucking the date-fruits came, I went to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! you know that my father was martyred on Uhud's day and owed much debt, and I wish that the creditors would see you." The Prophet said, "Go and collect the various kinds of dates and place them separately in heaps"' I did accordingly and called him. On seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over it and said, "Call your companions (i.e. the creditors)." Then he kept on measuring and giving them, till Alláh cleared all my father's debts. By Alláh, it would have pleased me that Alláh would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken a single date to my sisters. But by Alláh, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and I looked at the heap where Alláh's Apostle was sitting and noticed as if not a single date had been taken thereof.

I asked Alláh's Apostle, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is the best deed?" He replied, "To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." I asked, "What is next in goodness?" He replied, "To be good and dutiful to your parents." I further asked, what is next in goodness?" He replied, "To participate in Jihad in Alláh's Cause." I did not ask Alláh's Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told me more.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:42 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "There is no Hijra (i.e. migration) (from Mecca to Medina) after the Conquest (of Mecca), but Jihad and good intention remain; and if you are called (by the Muslim ruler) for fighting, go forth immediately.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:43 .italic}

(That she said), "O Alláh's Apostle! We consider Jihad as the best deed. Should we not fight in Alláh's Cause?" He said, "The best Jihad (for women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the Prophet's tradition and is accepted by Alláh)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:44 .italic}

A man came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward)." He replied, "I do not find such a deed." Then he added, "Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break your fast?" The man said, "But who can do that?" Abú- Huraira added, "The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#4:45 .italic}

Somebody asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who is the best among the people?" Alláh's Apostle replied "A believer who strives his utmost in Alláh's Cause with his life and property." They asked, "Who is next?" He replied, "A believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping Alláh and leaving the people secure from his mischief."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:46 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "The example of a Mujahid in Alláh's Cause-- and Alláh knows better who really strives in His Cause--is like a person who fasts and prays continuously. Alláh guarantees that He will admit the Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his home safely with rewards and war booty."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:47 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who would offer him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Alláh's Apostle, once visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Alláh's Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, "What causes you to smile, O Alláh's Apostle?" He said. "Some of my followers who (in a dream) were presented before me as fighters in Alláh's Cause (on board a ship) amidst this sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the thrones)." (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet used.) Um-Haram said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh that he makes me one of them. Alláh's Apostle invoked Alláh for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um Haram asked, "What makes you smile, O Alláh's Apostle?" He replied, "Some of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Alláh's Cause," repeating the same dream. Um-Haram said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh that He makes me one of them." He said, "You are amongst the first ones." It happened that she sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu'awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died.

The Prophet said, "Whoever believes in Alláh and His Apostle, offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramaḍán, will rightfully be granted Paradise by Alláh, no matter whether he fights in Alláh's Cause or remains in the land where he is born." The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the people with the is good news?" He said, "Paradise has one-hundred grades which Alláh has reserved for the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each of two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask Alláh (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the best and highest part of Paradise." (i.e. The sub-narrator added, "I think the Prophet also said, 'Above it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of Beneficent (i.e. Alláh), and from it originate the rivers of Paradise.")

Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, "A single endeavor (of fighting) in Alláh's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the bow or lash of one of you is better than all the world and whatever is in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in it."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:54 .italic}

The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is! Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and whom I cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya' (army-unit) setting out in Alláh's Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love to be martyred in Al1ah's Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and then get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get resurrected again and then get martyred.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:56 .italic}

Um Haram said, "Once the Prophet slept in my house near to me and got up smiling. I said, 'What makes you smile?' He replied, 'Some of my followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings on thrones.' I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh to make me one of them." So the Prophet invoked Alláh for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and told his dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said, "Invoke Alláh to make me one of them." He said, "You are among the first batch." Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband 'Ubada bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval expedition led by Mu awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus she died.

The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim to the tribe of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them, "I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of Alláh's Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close to me." So he went ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But while he was reporting the message of the Prophet , they beckoned to one of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal uncle said, "Alláh is Greater! By the Lord of the Kaba, I am successful." After that they attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who went up to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, "I think another man was saved along with him)." Gabriel informed the Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met their Lord, and He was pleased with them and made them pleased. We used to recite, "Inform our people that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made us pleased " Later on this Qur’ánic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked Alláh for forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam Usaiya who disobeyed Alláh and his Apostle.

That Abu Sufyan told him that Heraclius said to him, "I asked you about the outcome of your battles with him (i.e. the Prophet ) and you told me that you fought each other with alternate success. So the Apostles are tested in this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs.

My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of Badr. He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans. (By Alláh) if Alláh gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt. Alláh will see how (bravely) I will fight." On the day of Uhud when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, "O Alláh! I apologize to You for what these (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have done." Then he advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said "O Sad bin Muadh ! By the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud," Later on Sad said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers." We used to think that the following Verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: "Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Alláh..." (33.23) His sister Ar-Rubbaya' broke a front tooth of a woman and Alláh's Apostle ordered for retaliation. On that Anas (bin An-Nadr) said, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, my sister's tooth shall not be broken." Then the opponents of Anas's sister accepted the compensation and gave up the claim of retaliation. So Alláh's Apostle said, "There are some people amongst Alláh's slaves whose oaths are fulfilled by Alláh when they take them."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:80 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh welcomes two men with a smile; one of whom kills the other and both of them enter Paradise. One fights in Alláh's Cause and gets killed. Later on Alláh forgives the 'killer who also get martyred (In Alláh's Cause)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:80 .italic}

I went to Alláh's Apostle while he was at Khaibar after it had fallen in the Muslims' hands. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Give me a share (from the land of Khaibar)." One of the sons of Sa‘íd bin Al-'As said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do not give him a share." I said, "This is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal." The son of Said bin Al-As said, "Strange! A Wabr (i.e. guinea pig) who has come down to us from the mountain of Qaduim (i.e. grazing place of sheep) blames me for killing a Muslim who was given superiority by Alláh because of me, and Alláh did not disgrace me at his hands (i.e. was not killed as an infidel)." (The sub-narrator said "I do not know whether the Prophet gave him a share or not.")

When the Divine Inspiration: "Those of the believers who sit (at home), was revealed the Prophet sent for Zaid (bin Thabit) who came with a shoulder-blade and wrote on it. Ibn Um-Maktum complained about his blindness and on that the following revelation came: "Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury, or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive hard and fight in the Way of Alláh with their wealth and lives)." (4.95)

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad As-Sa‘ídi {#4:85 .italic}

I saw Marwan bin Al-Hakam sitting in the Mosque. So I came forward and sat by his side. He told us that Zaid bin Thabit had told him that Alláh's Apostle had dictated to him the Divine Verse: "Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Alláh with their wealth and lives.' (4.95) Zaid said, "Ibn-Maktum came to the Prophet while he was dictating to me that very Verse. On that Ibn Um Maktum said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If I had power, I would surely take part in Jihad." He was a blind man. So Alláh sent down revelation to His Apostle while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me that I feared that my thigh would be broken. Then that state of the Prophet was over after Alláh revealed "...except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc.) (4.95)

Alláh's Apostle went towards the Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and saw the Emigrants and the Ansar digging in a very cold morning as they did not have slaves to do that for them. When he noticed their fatigue and hunger he said, "O Alláh! The real life is that of the Here-after, (so please) forgive the Ansar and the Emigrants." In its reply the Emigrants and the Ansar said, "We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to Muḥammad that we will carry on Jihad as long as we live."

Narrated by Anas {#4:88 .italic}

The Emigrants and the Ansar started digging the trench around Medina carrying the earth on their backs and saying, "We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance to Muḥammad that we will I carry on Jihad as long as we live." The Prophet kept on replying, "O Alláh, there is no good except the good of the Hereafter; so confer Your Blessings on the Ansar and the Emigrants."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#4:89 .italic}

The Prophet went on carrying (i.e. the earth) and saying, "Without You (O Alláh!) we would have got no guidance."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#4:90 .italic}

On the day (of the battle) of Al-Ahzab (i.e. clans) I saw the Prophet carrying earth, and the earth was covering the whiteness of his abdomen. And he was saying, "Without You (O Alláh!) we would have got no guidance, nor given in charity, nor prayed. So please bless us with tranquility and make firm our feet when we meet our enemies. Indeed (these) people have rebelled against (oppressed) us but never shall we yield if they try to bring affliction upon us."

Narrated by Anas {#4:91 .italic}

We returned from the Ghazwa of Tabuk along with the Prophet. (See Ḥadít_h No. 92 below).

Narrated by Abu Said {#4:93 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "Indeed, anyone who fasts for one day for Alláh's Pleasure, Alláh will keep his face away from the (Hell) fire for (a distance covered by a journey of) seventy years."

The Prophet said, "Whoever spends two things in Alláh's Cause, will be called by all the gate-keepers of Paradise who will be saying, 'O so-and-so! Come here.' " Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Such persons will never be destroyed." The Prophet said, "I hope you will be one of them."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#4:95 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, "Nothing worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly blessings which will be conferred on you." Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures. He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A man got up saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?" The Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked, "Where is the present questioner?" "Do you think wealth is good?" he repeated thrice, adding, "No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent in Alláh's Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by Zaid bin Khalid {#4:96 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, " He who pre pares a Ghazi going in Alláh's Cause is given a reward equal to that of) a Ghazi; and he who looks after properly the dependents of a Ghazi going in Alláh's Cause is (given a reward equal to that of) Ghazi."

Anas asked, 'O Uncle! What is holding you back (from the battle)?' He replied, 'O my nephew! I am coming just now,' and went on perfuming himself with Hunut, then he came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people fled from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, 'Clear the way for me to fight the enemy. We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of Alláh's Apostle. How bad the habits you have acquired from your enemies!"

Narrated by Jabir {#4:99 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Who will bring me the information about the enemy on the day (of the battle) of Al-Ahzab (i.e. Clans)?" Az-Zubair said, "I will."

They saw an opener before he could see it. When they saw the opener, they did not speak anything till Abu Qatada saw it. So, he rode over his horse called Al-Jarada and requested them to give him his lash, but they refused. So, he himself took it and then attacked the opener and slaughtered it. He ate of its meat and his companions ate, too, but they regretted their eating. When they met the Prophet (they asked him about it) and he asked, "Have you some of its meat (left) with you?" Abu Qatada replied, "Yes, we have its leg with us." So, the Prophet took and ate it.

I replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." He said, "Alláh's right on His slaves is that they should worship Him (Alone) and should not worship any besides Him. And slave's right on Alláh is that He should not punish him who worships none besides Him." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Should I not inform the people of this good news?" He said, "Do not inform them of it, lest they should depend on it (absolutely)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:112 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, " Horses are kept for one of three purposes; for some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The one for whom they are a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for Alláh's Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area of the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or two hillocks then all its dung and its foot marks will be written as good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river and drinks water from it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a source of sins, he is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and showing enmity for Muslims: such a horse will be a source of sins for him. When Alláh's Apostle was asked about donkeys, he replied, "Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this unique, comprehensive Verse: "Then anyone who does an atom's (or a small ant's) weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an atom's (or a small ant's) weight of evil, shall see it.' (101.7-8)

Narrated by Muslim from Abu Aqil from Abu Al-Mutawakkil An-Naji {#4:113 .italic}

(Abu Aqil said, "I do not know whether that journey was for the purpose of Jihad or 'Umra.") "When we were returning," Jabir continued, "the Prophet said, 'Whoever wants to return earlier to his family, should hurry up.' We set off and I was on a black red tainted camel having no defect, and the people were behind me. While I was in that state the camel stopped suddenly (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, 'O Jabir, wait!' Then he hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, 'Will you sell the camel?' I replied in the affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went to the Mosque along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel on the pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, 'This is your camel.' He came out and started examining the camel and saying, 'The camel is ours.' Then the Prophet sent some Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, 'Give it to Jabir.' Then he asked, 'Have you taken the full price (of the camel)?' I replied in the affirmative. He said, 'Both the price and the camel are for you.' ''

When the Muslims started collecting the war booty, the pagans faced us with arrows, but Alláh's Apostle did not flee.

Let such a person perish and relapse, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him not find anyone to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in Alláh's Cause, with his hair unkempt and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for permission he is not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted."

So, the Prophet said, "Today, those who were not fasting took (all) the reward."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:141 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Charity is obligatory everyday on every joint of a human being. If one helps a person in matters concerning his riding animal by helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, all this will be regarded charity. A good word, and every step one takes to offer the compulsory Congregational prayer, is regarded as charity; and guiding somebody on the road is regarded as charity."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad As-Sa'di {#4:142 .italic}

The Prophet said to Abu Talha, "Choose one of your boy servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar." So, Abu Talha took me letting me ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I used to serve Alláh's Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, "O Alláh! I seek refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men." Then we reached Khaibar; and when Alláh enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while she was a bride. So Alláh's Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,' where her menses were over and he took her for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Alláh's Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of Alláh's Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Alláh's Apostle folding a cloak round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him) He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and said, "This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us." Then he looked at Medina and said, "O Alláh! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Alláh! Bless them (i.e. the people of Medina) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures)."

Invoke Alláh to make me one of them." He replied, "You are amongst them." He slept again and then woke up smiling and said the same as before twice or thrice. And she said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh to make me one of them." And he said, "You are amongst the first batch." 'Ubada bin As-Samit married her (i.e. Um Haram) and then he took her for Jihad.

He said, "Nobody did his job (i.e. fighting) so properly today as that man." Alláh's Apostle said, "Indeed, he is amongst the people of the (Hell) Fire." A man amongst the people said, "I shall accompany him (to watch what he does)" Thus he accompanied him, and wherever he stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he would run with him. Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided to bring about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the ground directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he leaned on the sword and killed himself. The other man came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "I testify that you are Alláh's Apostle." The Prophet asked, "What has happened?" He replied, "(It is about) the man whom you had described as one of the people of the (Hell) Fire. The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I said, 'I will find out his reality for you.' So, I came out seeking him. He got severely wounded, and hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed himself." when Alláh's Apostle said, "A man may seem to the people as if he were practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he is from the people of the Hell) Fire, another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the people of Hell (Fire), while in fact he is from the people of Paradise."

Alláh's Apostle wrote to Caesar and invited him to Islam and sent him his letter with Dihya Al-Kalbi whom Alláh's Apostle ordered to hand it over to the Governor of Busra who would forward it to Caesar. Caesar as a sign of gratitude to Alláh, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Alláh had granted Him victory over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Alláh's Apostle reached Caesar, he said after reading t, 'Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present here, in order to ask him about Alláh's Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that had been concluded between Alláh's Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said, Caesar's messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and we were admitted into Ceasar's court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his translator. 'Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a prophet." Abu Sufyan added, "I replied, 'I am the nearest relative to him.' He asked, 'What degree of relationship do you have with him?' I replied, 'He is my cousin,' and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, 'Let him come nearer.' He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said to his translator, 'Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately." Abu Sufyan added, "By Alláh ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his translator, 'Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.' I replied, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.' He said, 'Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before him? 'I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he claimed? ' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?' I replied, 'No.' He said, "Do the noble or the poor follow him?' I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.' He said, 'Are they increasing or decreasing (day by day)?' I replied,' They are increasing.' He said, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his (the Prophet's) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?'. I replied, 'No. ' He said, 'Does he break his promises? I replied, 'No, but we are now at truce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us." Abu Sufyan added, "Other than the last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'What was the outcome of your battles with him?' I replied, 'The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.' He said, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He tells us to worship Alláh alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what is entrusted to us.' When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, 'Say to him: I ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Alláh. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to worship Alláh alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.' " Abu Sufyan added, "Caesar then asked for the letter of Alláh's Apostle and it was read. Its contents were:-- "In the name of Alláh, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful (This letter is) from Muḥammad, the slave of Alláh, and His Apostle, to Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then, I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Alláh), embrace Islam and you will be safe; embrace Islam and Alláh will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we worship. None but Alláh, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none of us shall take others as Lords besides Alláh. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64) Abu Sufyan added, "When Heraclius had finished his speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him, and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them, 'Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha's (i.e. the Prophet's) affair has gained power. This is the King of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him." Abu Sufyan added, "By Alláh, I remained low and was sure that his religion would be victorious till Alláh converted me to Islam, though I disliked it "

So, the companions of the Prophet got up, wishing eagerly to see to whom the flag will be given, and everyone of them wished to be given the flag. But the Prophet asked for ‘Alí. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he ordered them to bring ‘Alí in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes and his eyes were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. ‘Alí said, "We will fight with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims)." The Prophet said, "Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what Alláh has enjoined upon them. By Alláh! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels."

(Alláh is Greater) and Khaibar is ruined, for whenever we approach a nation (i.e. enemy to fight) then it will be a miserable morning for those who have been warned."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:196 .italic}

Alláh 's Apostle said, " I have been ordered to fight with the people till they say, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh,' and whoever says, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh,' his life and property will be saved by me except for Islamic law, and his accounts will be with Alláh, (either to punish him or to forgive him.)"

Whenever Alláh's Apostle intended to carry out a Ghazwa, he would use an equivocation to conceal his real destination till it was the Ghazwa of Tabuk which Alláh's Apostle carried out in very hot weather. As he was going to face a very long journey through a wasteland and was to meet and attack a large number of enemies. So, he made the situation clear to the Muslims so that they might prepare themselves accordingly and get ready to conquer their enemy. The Prophet informed them of the destination he was heading for (Ka'b bin Malik used to say, "Scarcely did Alláh's Apostle set out for a journey on a day other than Thursday.")

We set out in the company of Alláh's Apostle five days before the end of Dhul Qa'da intending to perform Hajj only. When we approached Mecca Alláh's Apostle ordered those who did not have the Hádí (i.e. an animal for sacrifice) with them, to perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba, and between Safa and Marwa and then finish their Ihram. Beef was brought to us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering) and I asked, "What is this?" Somebody said, Alláh's Apostle has slaughtered (a cow) on behalf of his wives."

The 'Prophet said, "It is obligatory for one to listen to and obey (the ruler's orders) unless these orders involve one disobedience (to Alláh); but if an act of disobedience (to Alláh) is imposed, he should not listen to or obey it."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:204 .italic}

That heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "We are the last but will be the foremost to enter Paradise)." The Prophet added, "He who obeys me, obeys Alláh, and he who disobeys me, disobeys Alláh. He who obeys the chief, obeys me, and he who disobeys the chief, disobeys me. The Imam is like a shelter for whose safety the Muslims should fight and where they should seek protection. If the Imam orders people with righteousness and rules justly, then he will be rewarded for that, and if he does the opposite, he will be responsible for that."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:205 .italic}

When we reached (Hudaibiya) in the next year (of the treaty of Hudaibiya), not even two men amongst us agreed unanimously as to which was the tree under which we had given the pledge of allegiance, and that was out of Alláh's Mercy. (The sub narrator asked Naf'i, "For what did the Prophet take their pledge of allegiance, was it for death?" Naf'i replied "No, but he took their pledge of allegiance for patience.")

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Zaid {#4:206 .italic}

That in the time (of the battle) of Al-Harra a person came to him and said, "Ibn Hanzala is taking the pledge of allegiance from the people for death." He said, "I will never give a pledge of allegiance for such a thing to anyone after Alláh's Apostle."

Narrated by Yazíd bin Ubaid {#4:207 .italic}

Salama said, "I gave the Pledge of allegiance (Al-Riḍván) to Alláh's Apostle and then I moved to the shade of a tree.

I have already given to you the pledge of Allegiance.' He said, 'Do it again.' So I gave the pledge of allegiance for the second time." I asked 'O Abu Muslim! For what did you give he pledge of Allegiance on that day?" He replied, "We gave the pledge of Allegiance for death."

Narrated by Anas {#4:208 .italic}

On the day (of the battle) of the Trench, the Ansar were saying, "We are those who have sworn allegiance to Muḥammad for Jihaid (for ever) as long as we live." The Prophet replied to them, "O Alláh! There is no life except the life of the Hereafter. So honor the Ansar and emigrants with Your Generosity." And Narrated Mujashi: My brother and I came to the Prophet and I requested him to take the pledge of allegiance from us for migration. He said, "Migration has passed away with its people." I asked, "For what will you take the pledge of allegiance from us then?" He said, "I will take (the pledge) for Islam and Jihad."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:209 .italic}

Today a man came to me and asked me a question which I did not know how to answer. He said, "Tell me, if a wealthy active man, well-equipped with arms, goes out on military expeditions with our chiefs, and orders us to do such things as we cannot do (should we obey him?)" I replied, "By Alláh, I do not know what to reply you, except that we, were in the company of the Prophet and he used to order us to do a thing once only till we finished it. And no doubt, everyone among you will remain in a good state as long as he obeys Alláh. If one is in doubt as to the legality of something, he should ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a time when you will not find such a man. By Him, except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. I see that the example of what has passed of this life (to what remains thereof) is like a pond whose fresh water has been used up and nothing remains but muddy water."

Narrated by Salim Abu An-Nadr {#4:210 .italic}

The freed slave of ‘Umar bin 'Ubaidullah who was ‘Umar's clerk: ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Aufa wrote him (i.e. ‘Umar) a letter that contained the following:-- "Once Alláh's Apostle (during a holy battle), waited till the sun had declined and then he got up among the people and said, "O people! Do not wish to face the enemy (in a battle) and ask Alláh to save you (from calamities) but if you should face the enemy, then be patient and let it be known to you that Paradise is under the shades of swords." He then said,, "O Alláh! The Revealer of the (Holy) Book, the Mover of the clouds, and Defeater of Al-Ahzab (i.e. the clans of infidels), defeat them infidels and bestow victory upon us."

I participated in a Ghazwa along with Alláh's Apostle The Prophet met me (on the way) while I was riding a camel of ours used for irrigation and it had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet asked me, "What is wrong with the camel?" I replied, "It has got tired." So. Alláh's Apostle came from behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and going ahead of them. Then he asked me, "How do you find your camel (now)?" I replied, "I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings." He said, "Will you sell it to me?" I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, "Yes." He said, "Sell it to me then." I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I reached Medina. Then I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I am a bridegroom," and requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Alláh's Apostle he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had married a matron. He said, "Why hadn't you married a virgin who would have played with you, and you would have played with her?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! My father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them. So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them and teach them manners." When Alláh's Apostle arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning and he gave me its price and gave me the camel itself as well.

Alláh's Apostle said, "Were it not for the fear that it would be difficult for my followers, I would not have remained behind any Sariya, (army-unit) but I don't have riding camels and have no other means of conveyance to carry them on, and it is hard for me that my companions should remain behind me. No doubt I wish I could fight in Alláh's Cause and be martyred and come to life again to be martyred and come to life once more."

Narrated by Yali {#4:217 .italic}

I participated in the Ghazwa of Tabuk along with Alláh's Apostle and I gave a young camel to be ridden in Jihad and that was, to me, one of my best deeds. Then I employed a laborer who quarrelled with another person. One of them bit the hand of the other and the latter drew his hand from the mouth of the former pulling out his front tooth. Then the former instituted a suit against the latter before the Prophet who rejected that suit saying, "Do you expect him to put out his hand for you to snap as a male camel snaps (vegetation)?"

We said, "Either you take out the letter or else we will take off your clothes." So, she took it out of her braid. We brought the letter to Alláh's Apostle and it contained a statement from Hatib bin Abi Balta a to some of the Meccan pagans informing them of some of the intentions of Alláh's Apostle. Then Alláh's Apostle said, "O Hatib! What is this?" Hatib replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! Don't hasten to give your judgment about me. I was a man closely connected with the Quraish, but I did not belong to this tribe, while the other emigrants with you, had their relatives in Mecca who would protect their dependents and property . So, I wanted to recompense for my lacking blood relation to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my dependents. I did this neither because of disbelief not apostasy nor out of preferring Kufr (disbelief) to Islam." Alláh's Apostle, said, "Hatib has told you the truth." ‘Umar said, O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite." Alláh's Apostle said, "Hatib participated in the battle of Badr, and who knows, perhaps Alláh has already looked at the Badr warriors and said, 'Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:252 .italic}

When it was the day (of the battle) of Badr, prisoners of war were brought including Al-‘Abbás who was undressed. The Prophet looked for a shirt for him. It was found that the shirt of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai would do, so the Prophet let him wear it. That was the reason why the Prophet took off and gave his own shirt to ‘Abdu’lláh. (The narrator adds, "He had done the Prophet some favor for which the Prophet liked to reward him.")

Narrated by Sahl {#4:253 .italic}

On the day (of the battle) of Khaibar the Prophet said, "Tomorrow I will give the flag to somebody who will be given victory (by Alláh) and who loves Alláh and His Apostle and is loved by Alláh and His Apostle." So, the people wondered all that night as to who would receive the flag and in the morning everyone hoped that he would be that person. Alláh's Apostle asked, "Where is ‘Alí?" He was told that ‘Alí was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to his eyes and invoked Alláh to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The Prophet gave him the flag. ‘Alí said, "Should I fight them till they become like us (i.e. Muslim)?" The Prophet said, "Go to them patiently and calmly till you enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them, for, by Alláh, if Alláh gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than possessing red camels."

Narrated by Ikrima {#4:260 .italic}

‘Alí burnt some people and this news reached Ibn ‘Abbás, who said, "Had I been in his place I would not have burnt them, as the Prophet said, 'Don't punish (anybody) with Alláh's Punishment.'

Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after whey were Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and nobody provided them with water till they died (Abu Qilaba, a sub-narrator said, "They committed murder and theft and fought against Alláh and His Apostle, and spread evil in the land.")

Alláh's Apostles said to me, "Will you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa? Dhul-Khalasa was a house (of an idol) belonging to the tribe of Khath'am called Al-Ka'ba Al-Yama-niya. So, I proceeded with one hundred and fifty cavalry men from the tribe of Ahmas, who were excellent knights. It happened that I could not sit firm on horses, so the Prophet , stroke me over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over my chest, he said, 'O Alláh! Make him firm and make him a guiding and rightly guided man.' " Jarir proceeded towards that house, and dismantled and burnt it. Then he sent a messenger to Alláh's Apostle informing him of that. Jarir's messenger said, "By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come to you till I had left it like an emancipated or gabby camel (i.e. completely marred and spoilt)." Jarir added, "The Prophet asked for Alláh's Blessings for the horses and the men of Ahmas five times."

Alláh's Apostle sent a group of Ansari men to kill Abu-Rafi. One of them set out and entered their (i.e. the enemies) fort. That man said, "I hid myself in a stable for their animals. They closed the fort gate. Later they lost a donkey of theirs, so they went out in its search. I, too, went out along with them, pretending to look for it. They found the donkey and entered their fort. And I, too, entered along with them. They closed the gate of the fort at night, and kept its keys in a small window where I could see them. When those people slept, I took the keys and opened the gate of the fort and came upon Abu Rafi and said, 'O Abu Rafi. When he replied me, I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He shouted and I came out to come back, pretending to be a helper. I said, 'O Abu Rafi, changing the tone of my voice. He asked me, 'What do you want; woe to your mother?' I asked him, 'What has happened to you?' He said, 'I don't know who came to me and hit me.' Then I drove my sword into his belly and pushed it forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with puzzlement and went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down but I fell down and sprained my foot. I came to my companions and said, 'I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.' So, I did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi, the merchant pf Ḥijáz. Then I got up, feeling no ailment, (and we proceeded) till we came upon the Prophet and informed him."

(the freed slave of ‘Umar bin 'Ubaidullah) I was ‘Umar's clerk. Once ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Aufa wrote a letter to ‘Umar when he proceeded to Al-Haruriya. I read in it that Alláh's Apostle in one of his military expeditions against the enemy, waited till the sun declined and then he got up amongst the people saying, "O people! Do not wish to meet the enemy, and ask Alláh for safety, but when you face the enemy, be patient, and remember that Paradise is under the shades of swords." Then he said, "O Alláh, the Revealer of the Holy Book, and the Mover of the clouds and the Defeater of the clans, defeat them, and grant us victory over them."

He replied in the affirmative. So, Muḥammad bin Maslama went to him (i.e. Ka'b) and said, "This person (i.e. the Prophet) has put us to task and asked us for charity." Ka'b replied, "By Alláh, you will get tired of him." Muḥammad said to him, "We have followed him, so we dislike to leave him till we see the end of his affair." Muḥammad bin Maslama went on talking to him in this way till he got the chance to kill him.

I saw Alláh's Apostle on the day (of the battle) of the Trench carrying earth till the hair of his chest were covered with dust and he was a hairy man. He was reciting the following verses of ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Rawaha): "O Alláh, were it not for You, We would not have been guided, Nor would we have given in charity, nor prayed. So, bestow on us calmness, and when we meet the enemy. Then make our feet firm, for indeed, Yet if they want to put us in affliction, (i.e. want to fight against us) we would not (flee but withstand them)." The Prophet used to raise his voice while reciting these verses. (See Ḥadít_h No. 432, Vol. 5).

The Prophet appointed ‘Abdu’lláh bin Jubair as the commander of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. He instructed them, "Stick to your place, and don't leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you." Then the infidels were defeated. By Alláh, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Jubair said, "The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?" ‘Abdu’lláh bin Jubair said, "Have you forgotten what Alláh's Apostle said to you?" They replied, "By Alláh! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty." But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Alláh's Apostle in their rear was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred seventy men from us. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his companions had caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, "Is Muḥammad present amongst these people?" The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice, "Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?" He asked again thrice, "Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?" He then returned to his companions and said, "As for these (men), they have been killed." ‘Umar could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), "You told a lie, by Alláh! O enemy of Alláh! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there." Abu Sufyan said, "Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed" After that he started reciting cheerfully, "O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They said, "O Alláh's Apostle What shall we say?" He said, "Say, Alláh is Higher and more Sublime." (Then) Abu Sufyan said, "We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza." The Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What shall we say?" He said, "Says Alláh is our Helper and you have no helper."

Alláh's Apostle was the (most handsome), most generous and the bravest of all the people. Once the people of Medina got frightened having heard an uproar at night. So, the Prophet met the people while he was riding an unsaddled horse belonging to Abu Talha and carrying his sword (slung over his shoulder). He said (to them), "Don't get scared, don't get scared." Then he added, "I found it (i.e the horse) very fast."

I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf met me. I said to him, "Woe to you! What brought you here?" He replied, "The she-camels of the Prophet have been taken away." I said, "Who took them?" He said, "Ghatafan and Fazara." So, I sent three cries, "O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah !" so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains hear me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing arrows at them saying, "I am the son of Al-Akwa"; and today perish the mean people!" So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, "O Alláh's Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so send some people to chase them." The Prophet said, "O son of Al-Akwa', you have gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being entertained by their folk."

A man asked Al-Bara "O Abu 'Umara! Did you flee on the day (of the battle) of Hunain?" Al-Bara replied while I was listening, "As for Alláh's Apostle he did not flee on that day. Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith was holding the reins of his mule and when the pagans attacked him, he dismounted and started saying, 'I am the Prophet, and there is no lie about it; I am the son of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib.' On that day nobody was seen braver than the Prophet'".

When the tribe of Bani Quraiza was ready to accept Sad's judgment, Alláh's Apostle sent for Sad who was near to him. Sad came, riding a donkey and when he came near, Alláh's Apostle said (to the Ansar), "Stand up for your leader." Then Sad came and sat beside Alláh's Apostle who said to him. "These people are ready to accept your judgment." Sad said, "I give the judgment that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as prisoners." The Prophet then remarked, "O Sad! You have judged amongst them with (or similar to) the judgment of the King Alláh."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:281 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the leadership of 'Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of 'Asim bin ‘Umar Al-Khattab. They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between 'Usfan, and Mecca, and their news reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, "These are the dates of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), "and continued following their tracks When 'Asim and his companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them. The infidels said to them, "Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you that we will not kill any one of you" 'Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya said, "By Alláh! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O Alláh! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they martyred 'Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the third (of the captives) said, "This is the first betrayal. By Alláh! I will not go with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us." So, they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Naufal bin 'Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. Narrated Az-Zuhri: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Iyyad said that the daughter of Al-Harith had told him, "When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Alláh, I never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Alláh, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca." The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, "It was a boon Alláh bestowed upon Khubaib." When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, "Hadn't I been afraid that you would think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Alláh, kill them all with no exception." (He then recited the poetic verse):-- "I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Alláh's Cause, For my killing is for Alláh's Sake, And if Alláh wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body" Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak'at prayer (before being killed). Alláh fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) 'Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from his flesh.

I don't think we have such knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Alláh may endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur’án, and we have what is written in this paper as well." I asked, "What is written in this paper?" He replied, "(The regulations of) blood-money, the freeing of captives, and the judgment that no Muslim should be killed for killing an infidel."

(In another narration) Anas said, "Some wealth was brought to the Prophet from Bahrain. Al ‘Abbás came to him and said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Give me (some of it), as I have paid my and 'Aqil's ransom.' The Prophet said, 'Take,' and gave him in his garment."

The people (present there) differed in this matter and people should not differ before a prophet. They said, "Alláh's Apostle is seriously sick.' The Prophet said, "Let me alone, as the state in which I am now, is better than what you are calling me for." The Prophet on his death-bed, gave three orders saying, "Expel the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, respect and give gifts to the foreign delegates as you have seen me dealing with them." I forgot the third (order)" (Ya'qub bin Muḥammad said, "I asked Al-Mughira bin 'Abdur-Rahman about the Arabian Peninsula and he said, 'It comprises Mecca, Medina, Al-Yama-ma and Yemen." Ya'qub added, "And Al-Arj, the beginning of Tihama.")

‘Umar saw a silken cloak being sold in the market and he brought it to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Buy this cloak and adorn yourself with it on the 'Id festivals and on meeting the delegations." Alláh's Apostle replied, "This is the dress for the one who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter)." After sometime had passed, Alláh's Apostle sent a silken cloak to ‘Umar. ‘Umar took it and brought it to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You have said that this is the dress of that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have sent me this!" The Prophet said," I have sent it) so that you may sell it or fulfill with it some of your needs."

‘Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet set out with the Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet stroked him on the back with his hand and said, "Ibn Saiyad! Do you testify that I am Alláh's Apostle?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, "I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates." Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. "Do you testify that I am the apostle of Alláh?" The Prophet said to him, "I believe in Alláh and His Apostles." Then the Prophet said (to Ibn Saiyad). "What do you see?" Ibn Saiyad replied, "True people and false ones visit me." The Prophet said, "Your mind is confused as to this matter." The Prophet added, " I have kept something (in my mind) for you." Ibn Saiyad said, "It is Ad-Dukh." The Prophet said (to him), "Shame be on you! You cannot cross your limits." On that ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet said, "If he should be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then you cannot overpower him, and should he not be him, then you are not going to benefit by murdering him."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:290 .italic}

(Later on) Alláh's Apostle (once again) went along with Ubai bin Ka'b to the garden of date-palms where Ibn Saiyad was staying. When the Prophet entered the garden, he started hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palms as he wanted to hear something from the Ibn Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was lying in his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad's mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, "O Saf!" (And this was his name). Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, "Had this woman let him to himself, he would have revealed the reality of his case." Then the Prophet got up amongst the people, glorifying Alláh as He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, "I warn you about him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed his nation of. You should understand that he is a one-eyed man and Alláh is not one-eyed."

I asked the Prophet during his Hajj, "O Alláh's Apostle! Where will you stay tomorrow?" He said, "Has Aqil left for us any house?" He then added, "Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e. Al-Muhassab, where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal to heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against Bani Hashim on the terms that they would not deal with the members of the is tribe or give them shelter." (Az-Zuhri said, "Khaif means valley.") (See Ḥadít_h No. 659, Vol. 2)

Narrated by Aslam {#4:292 .italic}

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or other specified animals). He said to him, "O Hunai! Don't oppress the Muslims and ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is responded to (by Alláh); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf and the livestock of ('Uthman) bin 'Affan, for if their livestock should perish, then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and appeal for help saying, 'O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!' Would I then neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims' treasury). By Alláh, these people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Alláh's Cause, I would not have turned even a span of their land into a Hima."

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#4:293 .italic}

The Prophet said (to us), " List the names of those people who have announced that they are Muslims." So, we listed one thousand and five hundred men. Then we wondered, "Should we be afraid (of infidels) although we are one thousand and five hundred in number?" No doubt, we witnessed ourselves being afflicted with such bad trials that one would have to offer the prayer alone in fear.

We were in the company of Alláh's Apostle in a Ghazwa, and he remarked about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, "This (man) is from the people of the (Hell) Fire." When the battle started, the man fought violently till he got wounded. Somebody said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The man whom you described as being from the people of the (Hell) Fire fought violently today and died." The Prophet said, "He will go to the (Hell) Fire." Some people were on the point of doubting (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this state, suddenly someone said that he was still alive but severely wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and committed suicide. The Prophet was informed of that, and he said, "Alláh is Greater! I testify that I am Alláh's Slave and His Apostle." Then he ordered Bilal to announce amongst the people: 'None will enter Paradise but a Muslim, and Alláh may support this religion (i.e. Islam) even with a disobedient man.'

Alláh's Apostle delivered a sermon and said, "Zaid received the flag and was martyred, then Ja'far took it and was martyred, then ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha took it and was martyred, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took it without being appointed, and Alláh gave him victory." The Prophet added, "I am not pleased (or they will not be pleased) that they should remain (alive) with us," while his eyes were shedding tears.

Narrated by Anas {#4:299 .italic}

The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usiya and Bani Lihyan came to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they requested him to support them with some men to fight their own people. The Prophet supported them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi'r-Ma'ana where they betrayed and martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan for one month in the prayer. Narrated Qatada: Anas told us that they (i.e. Muslims) used to recite a Qur’ánic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:-- "O Alláh! Let our people be informed on our behalf that we have met our Lord Who has got pleased with us and made us pleased." Then the Verse was cancelled.

I then started playing with the seal of Prophethood (in between the Prophet's shoulders) and my father rebuked me harshly for that. Alláh's Apostle said. "Leave her," and then Alláh's Apostle (invoked Alláh to grant me a long life) by saying (thrice), "Wear this dress till it is worn out and then wear it till it is worn out, and then wear it till it is worn out." (The narrator adds, "It is said that she lived for a long period, wearing that (yellow) dress till its color became dark because of long wear.")

The Prophet got up amongst us and mentioned Al Ghulul, emphasized its magnitude and declared that it was a great sin saying, "Don't commit Ghulul for I should not like to see anyone amongst you on the Day of Ressurection, carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating, or carrying over his neck a horse that will be neighing. Such a man will be saying: 'O Alláh's Apostle! Intercede with Alláh for me,' and I will reply, 'I can't help you, for I have conveyed Alláh's Message to you Nor should I like to see a man carrying over his neck, a camel that will be grunting. Such a man will say, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Intercede with Alláh for me, and I will say, 'I can't help you for I have conveyed Alláh's Message to you,' or one carrying over his neck gold and silver and saying, 'O Alláh's Apostle!

We got some camels and sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They hurried and put the cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Alláh's Permission). On that the Prophet said, 'Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so, if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way." My grandfather asked (the Prophet ), "We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if Alláh's Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won't use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the Ethiopians."

Jarir bin ‘Abdu’lláh said to me, "Alláh's Apostle said to me, 'Won't you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?' Dhul-Khalasa was a house where the tribe of Khatham used to stay, and it used to be called Ka'bat-ul Yamaniya. So I proceeded with one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the Prophet that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, 'O Alláh! Make him firm and a guiding and rightly-guided man." Jarir set out towards that place, dismantled and burnt it, and then sent the good news to Alláh's Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to Alláh's Apostle. "O Alláh's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel (covered with tar)." So the Prophet invokes Alláh to Bless the horses of the men of Ahmas five times.

Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman said to Abu Talha who was one of the supporters of ‘Alí, "I perfectly know what encouraged your leader (i.e. ‘Alí) to shed blood. I heard him saying: Once the Prophet sent me and Az-Zubair saying, 'Proceed to such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will find a lady whom Hatib has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested the lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, 'Hatib has not given me any letter.' We said to her. 'Take out the letter or else we will strip off your clothes.' So she took it out of her braid. So the Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, 'Don't hurry in judging me, for, by Alláh, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to Islam is increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that there is none of your companions but has relatives in Mecca who look after their families and property, while I have nobody there, so I wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family and property).' The Prophet believed him. ‘Umar said, 'Allow me to chop off his (i.e. Hatib's) neck as he has done hypocrisy.' The Prophet said, (to ‘Umar), 'Who knows, perhaps Alláh has looked at the warriors of Badr and said (to them), 'Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you.' " 'Abdur-Rahman added, "So this is what encouraged him (i.e. ‘Alí)."

Narrated by ‘Alí {#4:324 .italic}

I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and the Prophet had given me a she-camel from the Khumus. When I intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Alláh's Apostle, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa' to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two she-camels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, "Who has done this?" The people replied, "Hamza bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in this house." I went away till I reached the Prophet and Zaid bin Haritha was with him. The Prophet noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet asked. "What is wrong with you." I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some drunks." The Prophet then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Alláh's Apostle started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. Hamza looked at Alláh's Apostle and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then said, "Aren't you but the slaves of my father?" Alláh's Apostle realized that he was drunk, so Alláh's Apostle retreated, and we went out with him.

(mother of the believers) After the death of Alláh 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Alláh's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Alláh's Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Alláh had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Alláh's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Alláh's Apostle. She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of Alláh's Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, "I will not leave anything Alláh's Apostle used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the Prophet's tradition, then I would go astray." (Later on) ‘Umar gave the Prophet's property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to ‘Alí and ‘Abbás, but he withheld the properties of Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, "These two properties are the Sadaqa which Alláh's Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is to be entrusted to the ruler." (Az-Zuhrl said, "They have been managed in this way till today.")

Narrated by Malik bin Aus {#4:326 .italic}

While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot. Suddenly the messenger of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and said, "The chief of the believers has sent for you." So, I went along with him till I entered the place where ‘Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, "O Malik! Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them." I said, "O chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it." He said, "O man! Take it." While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa' came saying, "'Uthman, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf, Az-Zubair and Sad bin Abi Waqqas are asking your permission (to see you); may I admit them?" ‘Umar said, "Yes", So they were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa' came again and said, "May I admit ‘Alí and ‘Abbás?" ‘Umar said, "yes." So, they were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then ‘Abbás said, "O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. ‘Alí)." They had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Alláh had given to His Apostle as Fai. The group (i.e. 'Uthman and his companions) said, "O chief of the believers! Judge between them and relieve both of them front each other." ‘Umar said, "Be patient! I beseech you by Alláh by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you know that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Our (i.e. prophets') property will not be inherited, and whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),' and Alláh's Apostle meant himself (by saying "we'')?" The group said, "He said so." ‘Umar then turned to ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "I beseech you by Alláh, do you know that Alláh's Apostle said so?" They replied, " He said so." ‘Umar then said, "So, I will talk to you about this matter. Alláh bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else." ‘Umar then recited the Holy Verses: "What Alláh bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muḥammad) from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Alláh gives power to His Apostles over whomever He will 'And Alláh is able to do all things." 9:6) ‘Umar added "So this property was especially given to Alláh's Apostle, but, by Alláh, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Alláh's Apostle used to spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of its revenue to be spent on Alláh 's Cause. Alláh 's Apostle kept on doing this during all his lifetime. I ask you by Alláh do you know this?" They replies in the affirmative. ‘Umar then said to ‘Alí and ‘Abbás. "I ask you by Alláh, do you know this?" ‘Umar added, "When Alláh had taken His Prophet unto Him, 'Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle used to do, and Alláh knows that he was true, pious and rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Alláh took Abu Bakr unto Him and I became Abu Bakr's successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle used to do and as Abu Bakr used to do, and Alláh knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. 'Ah and ‘Abbás) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, ‘Abbás, came to me asking for your share from your nephew's property, and this man, i.e. ‘Alí, came to me asking for his wife's share from her father's property. I told you both that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Our (prophets') properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity).' When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I said to you, 'I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition that you would take Alláh's Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in charge of it.' So, both of you said (to me), 'Hand it over to us,' and on that condition I handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Alláh, did I hand it over to them on this condition?" The group aid, "Yes." Then ‘Umar faced ‘Alí and ‘Abbás saying, "I ask you by Alláh, did I hand it over to you on this condition?" They said, "Yes. " He said, " Do you want now to give a different decision? By Alláh, by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will do the job on your behalf."

So please order us some instructions that we may apply it to ourselves and also invite our people whom we left behind us to observe as well." The Prophet said, "I order you (to do) four (things) and forbid you (to do) four: I order you to believe in Alláh, that is, to testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh (the Prophet pointed with his hand); to offer prayers perfectly; to pay Zakat; to fast the month of Ramaḍán, and to pay the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth) of the war booty to Alláh and I forbid you to use Ad-dubba', An-Naqir, Al-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat (i.e. utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks)."

Alláh's Apostle addressed them saying, "Don't hurry! (She is my wife)," They said, "Glorified be Alláh! O Alláh's Apostle (You are far away from any suspicion)," and his saying was hard on them.

Alláh's Apostle said, "Booty has been made legal for me."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:352 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh guarantees him who strives in His Cause and whose motivation for going out is nothing but Jihad in His Cause and belief in His Word, that He will admit him into Paradise (if martyred) or bring him back to his dwelling place, whence he has come out, with what he gains of reward and booty."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:353 .italic}

The Prophet said, "A prophet amongst the prophets carried out a holy military expedition, so he said to his followers, 'Anyone who has married a woman and wants to consummate the marriage, and has not done so yet, should not accompany me; nor should a man who has built a house but has not completed its roof; nor a man who has sheep or shecamels and is waiting for the birth of their young ones.' So, the prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly at the time of the 'Asr prayer, he said to the sun, 'O sun! You are under Alláh's Order and I am under Alláh's Order O Alláh! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Alláh made him victorious. Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did not burn it. He said (to his men), 'Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over the hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your people. So all the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said, "You have committed the theft.' Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet added: Then Alláh saw our weakness and disability, so he made booty legal for us."

A bedouin asked the Prophet, "A man may fight for the sake of booty, and another may fight so that he may be mentioned by the people, and a third may fight to show his position (i.e. bravery); which of these regarded as fighting in Alláh's Cause?" The Prophet said, "He who fights so that Alláh's Word (i.e. Islam) should be superior, fights for Alláh's Cause."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Mulaika {#4:356 .italic}

Some silken cloaks with golden buttons were presented to the Prophet. He distributed them amongst his companions and kept one for Makhrama, bin Naufal. Later on Makhrama came along with his son Al-Miswar bin Makhrama, and stood up at the gate and said (to his son). "Call him (i.e. the Prophet) to me." The Prophet heard his voice, took a silken cloak and brought it to him, placing those golden buttons in front of him saying, "O Abu-al-Miswar! I have kept this aside for you! O Abu-al Miswar! I have kept this aside for you!" Makhrama was a bad-tempered man.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair {#4:358 .italic}

When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamál, he called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, "O my son! Today one will be killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will be something left for us from our money?" Az-Zubair added, "O my son! Sell our property and pay my debts." Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, ‘Abdu’lláh's sons. He said, "One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts, one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons." (Hisham, a sub-narrator added, "Some of the sons of ‘Abdu’lláh were equal in age to the sons of Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and ‘Abbás. ‘Abdu’lláh had nine sons and nine daughters at that time." (The narrator ‘Abdu’lláh added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my attention to his debts saying, "If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal to my Master to help you." By Alláh! I could not understand what he meant till I asked, "O father! Who is your Master?" He replied, "Alláh (is my Master)." By Alláh, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say, "Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf ." and Alláh would (help me to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought some money to deposit with him. Az Zubair would say, "No, (i won't keep it as a trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost." Az-Zubair was never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, and 'Uthman. (‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Ḥakím bin Hizam met ‘Abdu’lláh bin Zubair and asked, "O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?" ‘Abdu’lláh kept it as a secret and said, "One hundred thousand," Ḥakím said, "By Alláh! I don't think your property will cover it." On that ‘Abdu’lláh said to him, "What if it is two million and two hundred thousand?" Ḥakím said, "I don't think you can pay it; so if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you." Az-Zubair had already bought Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. ‘Abdu’lláh sold it for one million and six hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, "Any person who has any money claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba." There came to him ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ja'far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair, "If you wish I will forgive you the debt." ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Az-Zubair) said, "No." Then Ibn Ja'far said, "If you wish you can defer the payment if you should defer the payment of any debt." Ibn Az-Zubair said, "No." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ja'far said, "Give me a piece of the land." ‘Abdu’lláh bin AzZubair said (to him), "Yours is the land extending from this place to this place." So, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to Mu'awlya while 'Amr bin 'Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam'a were sitting with him. Mu'awiya asked, "At what price have you appraised Al-Ghaba?" He said, "One hundred thousand for each share," Muawiya asked, "How many shares have been left?" ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "Four and a half shares." Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair said, "I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand." 'Amr bin 'Uthman said, "I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand." Ibn Zam'a said, "I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand." Muawiya said, "How much is left now?" ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "One share and a half." Muawiya said, "I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty thousand." ‘Abdu’lláh also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair's sons said to him, "Distribute our inheritance among us." He said, "No, by Alláh, I will not distribute it among you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, 'Would those who have money claims on Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt." So, he started to announce that in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two hundred thousand.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:359 .italic}

'Uthman did not join the Badr battle because he was married to one of the daughters of Alláh's Apostle and she was ill. So, the Prophet said to him. "You will get a reward and a share (from the war booty) similar to the reward and the share of one who has taken part in the Badr battle."

Narrated by Marwan bin Al-Ḥakím and Miswar bin Makhrama {#4:360 .italic}

When the Hawazin delegation came to Alláh's Apostle after they had embraced Islam and requested him to return their properties and war prisoners to them, Alláh's Apostle said, "To me the best talk is the truest, so you may choose either of two things; the war prisoners or the wealth, for I have delayed their distribution." Alláh's Apostle had waited for them for over ten days when he returned from Ta'if. So, when those people came to know that Alláh's Apostle was not going to return to them except one of the two things the said, "We choose our war Prisoners 'Alláh's Apostle stood up amongst the Muslims, and after glorifying Alláh as He deserved, he said, "Now then, these brothers of yours have come to us with repentance, and I see it logical that I should return their captives to them, so whoever of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to stick to his share, let him give up his prisoners and we will compensate him from the very first Fai' (i.e. war booty received without fight) which Alláh will give us." On that, all the people said. 'O Alláh's Apostles We have agreed willingly to do so (return the captives)" Then Alláh's Apostle said to them "I do not know who amongst you has agreed to this and who has not. You should return and let your leaders inform me of your agreement." The people returned and their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given the permission to return the war prisoners (without Compensation)" (Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states) This is what has been related to us about the captives of Hawazin.

Narrated by Zahdam {#4:361 .italic}

Once we were in the house of Abu Musa who presented a meal containing cooked chicken. A man from the tribe of Bani Taim Alláh with red complexion as if he were from the Byzantine war prisoners, was present. Abu Musa invited him to share the meal but he (apologised) saying. "I saw chickens eating dirty things and so I have had a strong aversion to eating them, and have taken an oath that I will not eat chickens." Abu Musa said, "Come along, I will tell you about this matter (i.e. how to cancel one's oat ). I went to the Prophet in the company of a group of Al-Ashariyin, asked him to provide us with means of conveyance. He said, 'By Alláh, I will not provide you with any means of conveyance and I have nothing to make you ride on.' Then some camels as booty were brought to Alláh's Apostle and he asked for us saying. 'Where are the group of Al-Ash'ariyun?' Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with white humps. When we set out we said, 'What have we done? We will never be blessed (with what we have been given).' So, we returned to the Prophet and said, 'We asked you to provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us with any means of conveyance. Did you forget (your oath when you gave us the camels)? He replied. 'I have not provided you with means of conveyance, but Alláh has provided you with it, and by Alláh, Alláh willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on I find that it is more beneficial to do something different, I will do the thing which is better, and give expiation for my oath."

Alláh's Apostle sent a Sariya towards Najd, and ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar was in the Sariya. They gained a great number of camels as war booty. The share of each one of them was twelve or eleven camels, and they were given an extra camel each.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:363 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to give extra share to some of the members of the Sariya he used to send, in addition to the shares they shared with the army in general.

We got the news of the migration of the Prophet while we were in Yemen, so we set out migrating to him. We were, I and my two brothers, I being the youngest, and one of my brothers was Abu Burda and the other was Abu Ruhm. We were over fifty (or fifty-three or fifty two) men from our people. We got on board a ship which took us to An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja'far bin Abu Talib and his companions with An-Najaishi. Ja'far said (to us), "Alláh's Apostle has sent us here and ordered us to stay here, so you too, stay with us." We stayed with him till we all left (Ethiopia) and met the Prophet at the time when he had conquered Khaibar. He gave us a share from its booty (or gave us from its booty). He gave only to those who had taken part in the Ghazwa with him. but he did not give any share to any person who had not participated in Khaibar's conquest except the people of our ship, besides Ja'far and his companions, whom he gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people of the ship).

Narrated by Jabir {#4:365 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said (to me), "If the property of Bahrain had come to us, I would have given you so much and so much." But the Bahrain property did not come till the Prophet had died. When the Bahrain property came. Abu Bakr ordered somebody to announce, "Any person who has money claim on Alláh's Apostle or whom Alláh's Apostle had promised something, should come to us." So, I went to him and said, "Alláh's Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much." Abu Bakr scooped up money with both hands thrice for me." (The sub-narrator Sufyan illustrated this action by scooping up with both hands and said, "Ibn Munkadir, another sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in this way.") Narrated Jabir: Once I went to Abu Bakr and asked for the money but he did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I went to him for the third time and said, "I asked you, but you did not give me; then I asked you (for the second time) and you did not give me; then I asked you (for the third time) but you did not give me. You should either give me or allow yourself to be considered a miser regarding my case." Abu Bakr said, "You tell me that I am a miser with regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the inclination to give you." (In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up money with both hands for me and asked me to count it. I found out that It was five hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount.

I and 'Uthman bin 'Affan went to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You have given to Bani Al-Muttalib and left us although they and we are of the same kinship to you." Alláh's Apostle said, "Bani Muttalib and Bani Hashim are one and the same." The Prophet did not give a share to Bani Abd Shams and Bani Naufai. (Ibn Ishaq said, "Abd Shams and Hashim and Al-Muttalib were maternal brothers and their mother was 'Atika bint Murra and Naufal was their paternal brother.)

While I was standing in the row on the day (of the battle) of Badr, I looked to my right and my left and saw two young Ansari boys, and I wished I had been stronger than they. One of them called my attention saying, "O Uncle! Do you know Abu Jahl?" I said, "Yes, What do you want from him, O my nephew?" He said, "I have been informed that he abuses Alláh's Apostle. By Him in Whose Hands my life is, if I should see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet his fate." I was astonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my attention saying the same as the other had said. After a while I saw Abu Jahl walking amongst the people. I said (to the boys), "Look! This is the man you asked me about." So, both of them attacked him with their swords and struck him to death and returned to Alláh'S Apostle to inform him of that. Alláh's Apostle asked, "Which of you has killed him?" Each of them said, "I Have killed him." Alláh's Apostle asked, "Have you cleaned your swords?" They said, "No. " He then looked at their swords and said, "No doubt, you both have killed him and the spoils of the deceased will be given to Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh." The two boys were Muadh bin 'Afra and Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh.

Narrated by Abu Qatada {#4:370 .italic}

We set out in the company of Alláh's Apostle on the day (of the battle) of Hunain. When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released me. I followed ‘Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), "What is wrong with the people (fleeing)?" He replied, "This is the Will of Alláh," After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, "Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will posses his spoils." I got up and said, "Who will be a witness for me?" and then sat down. The Prophet again said, "Anyone who has killed an enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils." I (again) got up and said, "Who will be a witness for me?" and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Alláh's Apostle said, "O Abu Qatada! What is your story?" Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, "O Alláh's Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So please compensate him on my behalf." On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, "No, by Alláh, he (i.e. Alláh's Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Alláh's Lions who fights on the behalf of Alláh and His Apostle." The Prophet said, "Abu Bakr has spoken the truth." So, Alláh's Apostle gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam.

Ḥakím bin Hizam said, "I asked Alláh's Apostle for something, and he gave me. I asked him again, and he gave me, and said to me. 'O Ḥakím! This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it without greed, then one is blessed in it, and if one takes it with greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and will be like the one who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than a lower (i.e. taking) hand,' I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I will not ask anyone for anything after you till I leave this world." So, when Abu Bakr during his Caliphate, called Ḥakím to give him (some money), Ḥakím refused to accept anything from him. Once ‘Umar called him (during his Caliphate) in order to give him something, but Ḥakím refused to accept it, whereupon ‘Umar said, "O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Ḥakím) his right which Alláh has assigned to him) from this Fai '(booty), but he refuses to take it." So Ḥakím never took anything from anybody after the Prophet till he died.

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I vowed to observe Itikaf for one day during the Pre-lslamic period." The Prophet ordered him to fulfill his vow. ‘Umar gained two lady captives from the war prisoners of Hunain and he left them in some of the houses at Mecca. When Alláh's Apostle freed the captives of Hunain without ransom, they came out walking in the streets. ‘Umar said (to his son), "O ‘Abdu’lláh! See what is the matter." ‘Abdu’lláh replied, "Alláh's Apostle has freed the captives without ransom." He said (to him), "Go and set free those two slave girls." (Nafi added:) Alláh's Apostle did not perform the 'Umra from Al-Jarana, and if he had performed the 'Umra, it would not have been hidden from ‘Abdu’lláh.

Narrated by 'Amr bin Taghlib {#4:373 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle gave (gifts) to some people to the exclusion of some others. The latter seemed to be displeased by that. The Prophet said, "I give to some people, lest they should deviate from True Faith or lose patience, while I refer other people to the goodness and contentment which Alláh has put in their hearts, and 'Amr bin Taghlib is amongst them." 'Amr bin Taghlib said, "The statement of Alláh's Apostle is dearer to me than red camels." Narrated Al-Ḥasan: 'Amr bin Taghlib told us that Alláh's Apostle got some property or some war prisoners and he distributed them in the above way (i.e. giving to some people to the exclusion of others).

When Alláh favored His Apostle with the properties of Hawazin tribe as Fai (booty), he started giving to some Quarries men even up to one-hundred camels each, whereupon some Ansari men said about Alláh's Apostle, "May Alláh forgive His Apostle! He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels)" When Alláh's Apostle was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent and did not call anybody else along, with them. When they gathered, Alláh's Apostle came to them and said, "What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that which you have said?" The learned ones among them replied," O Alláh's Apostle! The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, 'May Alláh forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quarish and leaves the Ansar, in spite of the fact that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.' " Alláh's Apostle replied, I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won't you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Alláh's Apostle to your houses? By Alláh, what you will return with, is better than what they are returning with." The Ansar replied, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle, we are satisfied' Then the Prophet said to them." You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Then be patient till you meet Alláh and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in Paradise)." (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient.

That while he was with Alláh's Apostle who was accompanied by the people on their way back from Hunain, the bedouins started begging things of Alláh's Apostle so much so that they forced him to go under a Samura tree where his loose outer garment was snatched away. On that, Alláh's Apostle stood up and said to them, "Return my garment to me. If I had as many camels as these trees, I would have distributed them amongst you; and you will not find me a miser or a liar or a coward."

While I was walking with the Prophet who was wearing a Najrani outer garment with a thick hem, a bedouin came upon the Prophet and pulled his garment so violently that I could recognize the impress of the hem of the garment on his shoulder, caused by the violence of his pull. Then the bedouin said, "Order for me something from Alláh's Fortune which you have." The Prophet turned to him and smiled, and ordered that a gift be given to him.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:378 .italic}

On the day (of the battle) of Hunain, Alláh's Apostle favored some people in the distribution of the booty (to the exclusion of others); he gave Al-Aqra' bin Habis one-hundred camels and he gave 'Uyaina the same amount, and also gave to some of the eminent Arabs, giving them preference in this regard. Then a person came and said, "By Alláh, in this distribution justice has not been observed, nor has Alláh's Pleasure been aimed at." I said (to him), "By Alláh, I will inform the Prophet (of what you have said), "I went and informed him, and he said, "If Alláh and His Apostle did not act justly, who else would act justly. May Alláh be merciful to Moses, for he was harmed with more than this, yet he kept patient."

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab expelled all the Jews and Christians from the land of Ḥijáz. Alláh's Apostle after conquering Khaibar, thought of expelling the Jews from the land which, after he conquered it belonged to Alláh, Alláh's Apostle and the Muslims. But the Jews requested Alláh's Apostle to leave them there on the condition that they would do the labor and get half of the fruits (the land would yield). Alláh's Apostle said, "We shall keep you on these terms as long as we wish." Thus they stayed till the time of ‘Umar's Caliphate when he expelled them to Taima and Ariha.

Narrated by Ibn Abi Aufa {#4:383 .italic}

We were afflicted with hunger during the besiege of Khaibar, and when it was the day of (the battle of) Khaibar, we slaughtered the donkeys and when the pots got boiling (with their meat). Alláh's Apostle made an announcement that all the pots should be upset and that nobody should eat anything of the meat of the donkeys. We thought that the Prophet prohibited that because the Khumus had not been taken out of the booty (i.e. donkeys); other people said, "He prohibited eating them for ever." The sub-narrator added, "I asked Said bin Jubair who said, 'He has made the eating of donkeys' meat illegal for ever.")

We were sitting at the steps of Zam-zam well and Bajala said, "I was the clerk of Juz bin Muawiya, Al-Ahnaf's paternal uncle. A letter came from ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab one year before his death; and it was read:-- "Cancel every marriage contracted among the Magians between relatives of close kinship (marriages that are regarded illegal in Islam: a relative of this sort being called Dhu-Mahram.)" ‘Umar did not take the Jizya from the Magian infidels till 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf testified that Alláh's Apostle had taken the Jizya from the Magians of Hajar.

(who was an ally of Bam 'Amr bin Lu'ai and one of those who had taken part in (the Ghazwa of) Badr): Alláh's Apostle sent Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarreh to Bahrain to collect the Jizya. Alláh's Apostle had established peace with the people of Bahrain and appointed Al-‘Alá’ bin Al-Hadrami as their governor. When Abu 'Ubaida came from Bahrain with the money, the Ansar heard of Abu 'Ubaida's arrival which coincided with the time of the morning prayer with the Prophet. When Alláh's Apostle led them in the morning prayer and finished, the Ansar approached him, and he looked at them and smiled on seeing them and said, "I feel that you have heard that Abu. 'Ubaida has brought something?" They said, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle' He said, "Rejoice and hope for what will please you! By Alláh, I am not afraid of your poverty but I am afraid that you will lead a life of luxury as past nations did, whereupon you will compete with each other for it, as they competed for it, and it will destroy you as it destroyed them."

‘Umar sent the Muslims to the great countries to fight the pagans. When Al-Hurmuzan embraced Islam, ‘Umar said to him. "I would like to consult you regarding these countries which I intend to invade." Al-Hurmuzan said, "Yes, the example of these countries and their inhabitants who are the enemies. of the Muslims, is like a bird with a head, two wings and two legs; If one of its wings got broken, it would get up over its two legs, with one wing and the head; and if the other wing got broken, it would get up with two legs and a head, but if its head got destroyed, then the two legs, two wings and the head would become useless. The head stands for Khosrau, and one wing stands for Caesar and the other wing stands for Faris. So, order the Muslims to go towards Khosrau." So, ‘Umar sent us (to Khosrau) appointing An-Numan bin Muqrin as our commander. When we reached the land of the enemy, the representative of Khosrau came out with forty-thousand warriors, and an interpreter got up saying, "Let one of you talk to me!" Al-Mughira replied, "Ask whatever you wish." The other asked, "Who are you?" Al-Mughira replied, "We are some people from the Arabs; we led a hard, miserable, disastrous life: we used to suck the hides and the date stones from hunger; we used to wear clothes made up of fur of camels and hair of goats, and to worship trees and stones. While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earths, Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves a Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, has ordered us to fight you till you worship Alláh Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:-- "Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e. martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master." (Al-Mughira, then blamed An-Numan for delaying the attack and) An-Nu' man said to Al-Mughira, "If you had participated in a similar battle, in the company of Alláh's Apostle he would not have blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you. But I accompanied Alláh's Apostle in many battles and it was his custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would wait till the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e. after midday)."

Once the Prophet called the Ansar in order to grant them part of the land of Bahrain. On that they said, "No! By Alláh, we will not accept it unless you grant a similar thing to our Quarries brothers as well." He said, "That will be their's if Alláh wishes." But when the Ansar persisted in their request, he said, "After me you will see others given preference over you in this respect (in which case) you should be patient till you meet me at the Tank (of Al-Kauthar)."

Alláh's Apostle once said to me, "If the revenue of Bahrain came, I would give you this much and this much." When Alláh's Apostle had died, the revenue of Bahrain came, and Abu Bakr announced, " Let whoever was promised something by Alláh's Apostle come to me." So, I went to Abu Bakr and said, "Alláh's Apostle said to me, 'If the revenue of Bahrain came, I would give you this much and this. much." On that Abu Bakr said to me, "Scoop (money) with both your hands." I scooped money with both my hands and Abu Bakr asked me to count it. I counted it and it was five-hundred (gold pieces). The total amount he gave me was one thousand and five hundred (gold pieces.) Narrated Anas: Money from Bahrain was brought to the Prophet . He said, "Spread it in the Mosque." It was the biggest amount that had ever been brought to Alláh's Apostle . In the meantime Al-‘Abbás came to him and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Give me, for I gave the ransom of myself and Aqil." The Prophet said (to him), "Take." He scooped money with both hands and poured it in his garment and tried to lift it, but he could not and appealed to the Prophet, "Will you order someone to help me in lifting it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-‘Abbás said, "Then will you yourself help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al ‘Abbás threw away some of the money, but even then he was not able to lift it, and so he gain requested the Prophet "Will you order someone to help me carry it?" The Prophet said, "No." Then Al-‘Abbás said, "Then will you yourself yelp me carry it?" The Prophet said, 'No." So, Al-‘Abbás threw away some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and went away. The Prophet kept on looking at him with astonishment at his greediness till he went out of our sight. Alláh's Apostle did not get up from there till not a single Dirham remained from that money.

He said, "When the condition (i.e. health) of Alláh's Apostle deteriorated, he said, 'Bring me a bone of scapula, so that I may write something for you after which you will never go astray.'The people differed in their opinions although it was improper to differ in front of a prophet, They said, 'What is wrong with him? Do you think he is delirious? Ask him (to understand). The Prophet replied, 'Leave me as I am in a better state than what you are asking me to do.' Then the Prophet ordered them to do three things saying, 'Turn out all the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, show respect to all foreign delegates by giving them gifts as I used to do.' " The sub-narrator added, "The third order was something beneficial which either Ibn ‘Abbás did not mention or he mentioned but I forgot.'

They said, "We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would get rid of you, and if you are a prophet then the poison would not harm you."

So, whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin or gives shelter in it, to such an innovator will incur the Curse of Alláh, the angels and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.

'Abdur-Rahman kept silent and the other two spoke. The Prophet said, "If you swear as to who has committed the murder, you will have the right to take your right from the murderer." They said, "How should we swear if we did not witness the murder or see the murderer?" The Prophet said, "Then the Jews can clear themselves from the charge by taking Alaska (an oath taken by men that it was not they who committed the murder)." The!y said, "How should we believe in the oaths of infidels?" So, the Prophet himself paid the blood money (of ‘Abdu’lláh). (See Ḥadít_h No. 36 Vol. 9.)

And the day of Al-Hajj-ul-Akbar is the day of Nahr, and it called Al-Akbar because the people call the 'Umra Al-Hajj-ul-Asghar (i.e. the minor Hajj). Abu Bakr threw back the pagans' covenant that year, and therefore, no pagan performed the Hajj in the year of Hajj-ul-Wada' of the Prophets.

He said, "By Him in Whose Hands Abu Huraira's life is, I know it through the statement of the true and truly inspired one (i.e. the Prophet)." The people asked, "What does the Statement say?" He replied, "Alláh and His Apostle's asylum granted to Dhimmis, i.e. non-Muslims living in a Muslim territory) will be outraged, and so Alláh will make the hearts of these Dhimmis so daring that they will refuse to pay the Jizya they will be supposed to pay."

So ‘Alí bin Abi-Talib started writing the treaty between them. He wrote, "This is what Muḥammad, Apostle of Alláh has agreed to." The (Meccans) said, "If we knew that you (Muḥammad) are the Apostle of Alláh, then we would not have prevented you and would have followed you. But write, 'This is what Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh has agreed to..' " On that Alláh's Apostle said, "By Alláh, I am Muḥammad bin ‘Abdu’lláh, and, by Alláh, I am Apostle of 'Alláh." Alláh's Apostle used not to write; so he asked ‘Alí to erase the expression of Apostle of Alláh. On that ‘Alí said, "By Alláh I will never erase it." Alláh's Apostle said (to ‘Alí), "Let me see the paper." When ‘Alí showed him the paper, the Prophet erased the expression with his own hand. When Alláh's Apostle had entered Mecca and three days had elapsed, the Meccans came to ‘Alí and said, "Let your friend (i.e. the Prophet) quit Mecca." ‘Alí informed Alláh's Apostle about it and Alláh's Apostle said, "Yes," and then he departed.

Its thorny bushes should not be cut, and its game should not be chased, its fallen property (i.e. Luqata) should not be picked up except by one who will announce it publicly; and its grass should not be uprooted," On that Al-‘Abbás said, "O Alláh's Apostle!

The Prophet said, "While I was at the House in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel. When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, 'Open the gate.' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' He said, 'Gabriel.' The gate-keeper,' Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel said, 'Muḥammad.' The gate-keeper said, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!' Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, 'You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.' Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He said, 'Muḥammad' It was asked, 'Has he been sent for?' He said, 'Yes.' It was said, 'He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!" Then I met Jesus and Yaḥyá (John) who said, 'You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.' Then we ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is with you? Gabriel said, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been sent for?' 'Yes,' said Gabriel. 'He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!' (The Prophet added:). There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, 'You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet!' Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He said, 'You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.' Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I met and greeted Aaron who said, 'You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet". Then we ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, 'You are welcomed O brother and. a Prophet.' When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, 'O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my followers.' Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Abraham who said, 'You are welcomed o son and a Prophet.' Then I was shown Al-Bait-al-Ma'mur (i.e. Alláh's House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al Bait-ul-Ma'mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).' Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, 'What have you done?' I said, 'Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.' He said, 'I know the people better than you, because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers.' I returned and requested Alláh (for reduction) and He made it forty. I returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Alláh for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who repeated the same advice. Ultimately Alláh reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again, he said, 'What have you done?' I said, 'Alláh has made it five only.' He repeated the same advice but I said that I surrendered (to Alláh's Final Order)'" Alláh's Apostle was addressed by Alláh, "I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds."

Alláh's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, "(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Alláh sends an angel who is ordered to write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature's) deeds, his livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire. And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise."

When He created him, He said to him, "Go and greet that group of angels, and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting (salutations of your offspring." So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, "As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi" (i.e. Peace and Alláh's Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.

What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle" Alláh's Apostle said, "Gabriel has just now told me of their answers." ‘Abdu’lláh said, "He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all the angels, is the enemy of the Jews." Alláh's Apostle said, "The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver. As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman gets discharge first, the child will resemble her." On that ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said, "I testify that you are the Apostle of Alláh." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam further said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they would tell a lie about me." The Jews came to Alláh's Apostle and ‘Abdu’lláh went inside the house. Alláh's Apostle asked (the Jews), "What kind of man is ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam amongst you?" They replied, "He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the son of the best amongst us." Alláh's Apostle said, "What do you think if he embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?" The Jews said, "May Alláh save him from it." Then ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam came out in front of them saying, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and that Muḥammad is the Apostle of Alláh."

Alláh's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, "(as regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for an other forty days, and then a piece of flesh for an other forty days. Then Alláh sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the people of the (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire."

The Prophet said, "Alláh has appointed an angel in the womb, and the angel says, 'O Lord! A drop of discharge (i.e. of semen), O Lord! a clot, O Lord! a piece of flesh.' And then, if Alláh wishes to complete the child's creation, the angel will say. 'O Lord! A male or a female? O Lord! wretched or blessed (in religion)? What will his livelihood be? What will his age be?' The angel writes all this while the child is in the womb of its mother."

Narrated by Anas {#4:551 .italic}

Then Alláh will say, 'While you were in the backbone of Adam, I asked you much less than this, i.e. not to worship others besides Me, but you insisted on worshipping others besides me.' "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:554 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Shall I not tell you about the Dajjal a story of which no prophet told his nation? The Dajjall is one-eyed and will bring with him what will resemble Hell and Paradise, and what he will call Paradise will be actually Hell; so I warn you (against him) as Noah warned his nation against him."

He will reply, 'Muḥammad and his followers (will stand witness for me).' So, I and my followers will stand as witnesses for him (that he conveyed Alláh's Message)." That is, (the interpretation) of the Statement of Alláh: "Thus we have made you a just and the best nation that you might be witnesses Over mankind .." (2.143)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:556 .italic}

We were in the company of the Prophet at a banquet and a cooked (mutton) forearm was set before him, and he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it and said, "I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know how Alláh will gather all the first and the last (people) in one level place where an observer will be able to see (all) of them and they will be able to hear the announcer, and the sun will come near to them. Some People will say: Don't you see, in what condition you are and the state to which you have reached? Why don't you look for a person who can intercede for you with your Lord? Some people will say: Appeal to your father, Adam.' They will go to him and say: 'O Adam! You are the father of all mankind, and Alláh created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate for you, and made you live in Paradise. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don't you see in what (miserable) state we are, and to what condition we have reached?' On that Adam will reply, 'My Lord is so angry as He has never been before and will never be in the future; (besides), He forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself! Myself! Go to somebody else; go to Noah.' They will go to Noah and say; 'O Noah! You are the first amongst the messengers of Alláh to the people of the earth, and Alláh named you a thankful slave. Don't you see in what a (miserable) state we are and to what condition we have reached? Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Noah will reply: 'Today my Lord has become so angry as he had never been before and will never be in the future Myself! Myself! Go to the Prophet (Muḥammad). The people will come to me, and I will prostrate myself underneath Alláh's Throne. Then I will be addressed: 'O Muḥammad! Raise your head; intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything). for you will be given. "

Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said, "Be afraid of Alláh, O Muḥammad!" The Prophet ' said "Who would obey Alláh if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Alláh has trusted all the people of the earth to me while, you do not trust me?" Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested the Prophet to let him chop that man's head off, but he prevented him. When the man left, the Prophet said, "Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the Qur’án but the Qur’án will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the religion as an arrow goes through the game's body. They will kill the Muslims but will not disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time' I will kill them as the people of 'Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them)."

At that time children will become hoary headed, every pregnant female will have a miscarriage, and one will see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but dreadful will be the Wrath of Alláh." The companions of the Prophet asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who is that (excepted) one?" He said, "Rejoice with glad tidings; one person will be from you and one-thousand will be from Gog and Magog." The Prophet further said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, hope that you will be one-fourth of the people of Paradise." We shouted, "Allahu Akbar!"

My companions!' It will be said: 'They renegade from Islam after you left them.' Then I will say as the Pious slave of Alláh (i.e. Jesus) said. 'And I was a witness Over them while I dwelt amongst them. When You took me up You were the Watcher over them, And You are a witness to all things. If You punish them.

You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and dishonoring my father?'

Alláh's Apostle said, "Abraham did not tell a lie except on three occasions."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:578 .italic}

Abraham did not tell a lie except on three occasion. Twice for the Sake of Alláh when he said, "I am sick," and he said, "(I have not done this but) the big idol has done it." The (third was) that while Abraham and Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant. Someone said to the tyrant, "This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very charming lady." So, he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, "Who is this lady?" Abraham said, "She is my sister." Abraham went to Sarah and said, "O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don't contradict my statement." The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sarah. "Pray to Alláh for me, and I shall not harm you." So Sarah asked Alláh to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again requested Sarah, "Pray to Alláh for me, and I will not harm you." Sarah asked Alláh again and he became alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said, "You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil." The tyrant then gave Hajar as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back (to Abraham) while he was praying. Abraham, gesturing with his hand, asked, "What has happened?" She replied, "Alláh has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me Hajar for service." (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying, "That (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of Ishmael, Hajar's son)."

Who is there amongst us who has not done wrong to himself?" He replied, "It is not as you say, for 'wrong' in the Verse and 'do not confuse their belief, with wrong means 'SHIRK' (i.e. joining others in worship with Alláh). Haven't you heard Luqman's saying to his son, 'O my son! Join not others in worship with Alláh, verily joining others in worship with Alláh is a great wrong indeed." (31.13)

(The narrator then mentioned the narration of intercession): "The people will go to Abraham and say: 'You are Alláh's Prophet and His Khalil on the earth. Will you intercede for us with your Lord?' Abraham will then remember his lies and say: 'Myself! Myself! Go to Moses."

The Prophet said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on the mother of Ishmael! Had she not hastened (to fill her water-skin with water from the Zam-zam well). Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth." Ibn ‘Abbás further added, "(The Prophet) Abraham brought Ishmael and his mother (to Mecca) and she was suckling Ishmael and she had a water-skin with her.'

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:583 .italic}

The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka'ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael's mother followed him saying, "O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, "Has Alláh ordered you to do so?" He said, "Yes." She said, "Then He will not neglect us," and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka'ba, and raising both hands, invoked Alláh saying the following prayers: 'O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Alláh) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.' (14.37) Ishmael's mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times." The Prophet said, "This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, 'O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it." The Prophet added, "May Alláh bestow Mercy on Ishmael's mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth." The Prophet further added, "Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Alláh which will be built by this boy and his father, and Alláh never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, 'This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water)." The Prophet added, "Ishmael's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, 'Do you allow us to stay with you?" She replied, 'Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that." The Prophet further said, "Ishmael's mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ishmael's mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael's marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael's wife about him, she replied, 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, 'We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,' complaining to him. He said, 'When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).' When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, 'Has anyone visited you?' She replied, 'Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.' On that Ishmael said, 'Did he advise you anything?' She replied, 'Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.' Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.' So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Alláh wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael's wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Abraham asked her, 'How are you getting on?' asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, 'We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).' Then she thanked Alláh' Abraham said, 'What kind of food do you eat?' She said. 'Meat.' He said, 'What do you drink?' She said, 'Water." He said, "O Alláh! Bless their meat and water." The Prophet added, "At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Alláh to bless it." The Prophet added, "If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca." The Prophet added," Then Abraham said Ishmael's wife, "When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.' When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, 'Did anyone call on you?' She replied, 'Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,' so she praised him and added. 'He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.' Ishmael asked her, 'Did he give you any piece of advice?' She said, 'Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.' On that Ishmael said, 'It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.' Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Alláh wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, 'O Ishmael! Alláh has given me an order.' Ishmael said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.' Abraham asked, 'Will you help me?' Ishmael said, 'I will help you.' Abraham said, Alláh has ordered me to build a house here,' pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it." The Prophet added, "Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka'ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.' The Prophet added, "Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka'ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing." (2.127)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:584 .italic}

When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael's mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away. They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael's mother used to drink water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael's mother followed him, and when they reached Kada', she called him from behind, 'O Abraham! To whom are you leaving us?' He replied, '(I am leaving you) to Alláh's (Care).' She said, 'I am satisfied to be with Alláh.' She returned to her place and started drinking water from the water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she said to herself, 'I'd better go and look so that I may see somebody.' She ascended the Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two mountains) many times. They she said to herself, 'i'd better go and see the state of the child,' she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), 'If I go and look, I may find somebody.' She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she said (to herself), 'I'd better go back and see the state of the child.' But suddenly she heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, 'Help us if you can offer any help.' Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this (Ibn ‘Abbás hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out. Ishmael's mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet) said, "If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth.") Ishmael's mother started drinking from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that astonished them, and they said, 'Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.' They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform them about it. Then they all went to her and said, 'O ishmael's mother! Will you allow us to be with you (or dwell with you)?' (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), 'I want to call on my dependents I left (at Mecca).' When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael's wife) and said, 'Where is Ishmael?' She replied, 'He has gone out hunting.' Abraham said (to her), 'When he comes, tell him to change the threshold of his gate.' When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael said to her, 'You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).' Again Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael's house and asked. "Where is Ishmael?" Ishmael's wife replied, "He has gone out hunting," and added, "Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?' Abraham asked, 'What is your food and what is your drink?' She replied, 'Our food is meat and our drink is water.' He said, 'O Alláh! Bless their meals and their drink." Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e. Prophet) said, "Because of Abraham's invocation there are blessings (in Mecca)." Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending his arrows. He said, "O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for Him." Ishmael said, "Obey (the order of) your Lord." Abraham said, "Alláh has also ordered me that you should help me therein." Ishmael said, "Then I will do." So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka'ba) while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, "O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing." (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham) could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, 'O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing." (2.127)

Practice archery (i.e. arrow throwing) as your father was a great archer (i.e. arrow-thrower). I am with (on the side of) the son of so-and-so-." Hearing that, one of the two teams stopped throwing. Alláh's Apostle asked them, ' Why are you not throwing?" They replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! How shall we throw when you are with the opposite team?" He said, "Throw, for I am with you all."

Some people asked the Prophet: "Who is the most honorable amongst the people?" He replied, "The most honorable among them is the one who is the most Alláh-fearing." They said, "O Alláh's Prophet! We do not ask about this." He said, "Then the most honorable person is Joseph, Alláh's Prophet, the son of Alláh's Prophet, the son of Alláh's Prophet, the son of Alláh's Khalil." They said, "We do not ask about this." He said, "Then you want to ask me about the Arabs' descent?" They said, "Yes." He said, "Those who were best in the pre-lslamic period, are the best in Islam, if they comprehend (the religious knowledge)."

That the Prophet said (to her). "Order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer." She replied," Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted person and when he stands at your place, he will weep (so he will not be able to lead the prayer)." The Prophet repeated the same order and she gave the same reply. The narrator, Shuba said that the Prophet said on the third or fourth time. "You are (like) the female companions of Joseph. Order Abu Bakr to lead the prayer. "

Consequently Abu Bakr led the people in prayer in the life-time of the Prophet.

Narrated by Masruq {#4:602 .italic}

I asked Um Ruman, 'Aisha's mother about the accusation forged against 'Aisha. She said, "While I was sitting with 'Aisha, an Ansari woman came to us and said, 'Let Alláh condemn such-and-such person.' I asked her, 'Why do you say so?' She replied, 'For he has spread the (slanderous) story.' 'Aisha said, 'What story?' The woman then told her the story. 'Aisha asked, 'Have Abu Bakr and Alláh's Apostle heard about it ?' She said, 'Yes.' 'Aisha fell down senseless (on hearing that), and when she came to her senses, she got fever and shaking of the body. The Prophet came and asked, 'What is wrong with her?' I said, 'She has got fever because of a story which has been rumored.' 'Aisha got up and said, 'By Alláh! Even if I took an oath, you would not believe me, and if I put forward an excuse, You would not excuse me. My example and your example is just like that example of Jacob and his sons. Against that which you assert, it is Alláh (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' (12.18) The Prophet left and then Alláh revealed the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that 'Aisha said, 'Thanks to Alláh (only) and not to anybody else."

I asked 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of the following Verse: "(Respite will be granted) 'Until when the apostles give up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people)..."(12.110) 'Aisha replied, "Really, their nations did not believe them." I said, "By Alláh! They were definite that their nations treated them as liars and it was not a matter of suspecting." 'Aisha said, "O 'Uraiya (i.e. 'Urwa)! No doubt, they were quite sure about it." I said, "May the Verse be read in such a way as to mean that the apostles thought that Alláh did not help them?" Aisha said, "Alláh forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a thing. But this Verse is concerned with the Apostles' followers who had faith in their Lord and believed in their apostles and their period of trials was long and Alláh's Help was delayed till the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Alláh's Help then came to them." Narrated Ibn ‘Umar: The Prophet said, "The honorable, the son of the honorable, the son of the honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham."

Alláh's Apostle said, "On the night of my Ascension to Heaven, I saw (the prophet) Moses who was a thin person with lank hair, looking like one of the men of the tribe of Shanua; and I saw Jesus who was of average height with red face as if he had just come out of a bathroom. And I resemble prophet Abraham more than any of his offspring does. Then I was given two cups, one containing milk and the other wine. Gabriel said, 'Drink whichever you like.' I took the milk and drank it. Gabriel said, 'You have accepted what is natural, (True Religion i.e. Islam) and if you had taken the wine, your followers would have gone astray.' "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:608 .italic}

The Prophet said, "One should not say that I am better than Jonah (i.e. Yunus) bin Matta." So, he mentioned his father Matta. The Prophet mentioned the night of his Ascension and said, "The prophet Moses was brown, a tall person as if from the people of the tribe of Shanu'a. Jesus was a curly-haired man of moderate height." He also mentioned Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire, and Ad-Dajjal.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:609 .italic}

When the Prophet came to Medina, he found (the Jews) fasting on the day of 'Ashura' (i.e. 10th of Muharram). They used to say: "This is a great day on which Alláh saved Moses and drowned the folk of Pharaoh. Moses observed the fast on this day, as a sign of gratitude to Alláh." The Prophet said, "I am closer to Moses than they." So, he observed the fast (on that day) and ordered the Muslims to fast on it.

Narrated by Abu Said {#4:610 .italic}

The Prophet said, 'People will be struck unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to regain consciousness, and behold!

The Prophet said, "Were it not for Bani Israel, meat would not decay; and were it not for Eve, no woman would ever betray her husband."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:612 .italic}

That he differed with Al-Hur bin Qais Al-Fazari regarding the companion of Moses. Ibn ‘Abbás said that he was Al-Khadir. Meanwhile Ubai bin Ka'b passed by them and Ibn ‘Abbás called him saying, "My friend and I have differed regarding Moses' companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Alláh's Apostle mentioning something about him?" He said, "Yes, I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked (him), 'Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?' Moses replied, 'No.' So, Alláh sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: 'Yes, Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).' Moses asked how to meet him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he would meet him. So, Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant boy of Moses said to him, 'Do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish, and t was only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.' Moses said, That was what we were seeking after,' and both of them returned, following their footmarks and found Khadir; and what happened further to them, is mentioned in Alláh's Book."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#4:613 .italic}

I said to Ibn ‘Abbás, "Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Alláh's enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai bin Ka'b told us that the Prophet said, 'Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, 'I.' Alláh admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Alláh). So, Alláh said to him, 'Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than you.' Moses said, 'O my Lord! How can I meet him?' Alláh said, 'Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.' Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha 'bin Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Alláh stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), 'Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.' Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Alláh had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him, 'Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?.' So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said, 'That was what we were seeking after.' So, both of them retraced their footsteps till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses greeted him and he replied saying, 'How do people greet each other in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The man asked, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes, I have come to you so that you may teach me from those things which Alláh has taught you.' He said, 'O Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Alláh which Alláh has taught me, and which you do not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Alláh which Alláh has taught you and which I do not know.' Moses asked, 'May I follow you?' He said, 'But you will not be able to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be able to understand?' (Moses said, 'You will find me, if Alláh so will, truly patient, and I will not disobey you in aught.') So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, 'O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Alláh's Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.' Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank, and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him, 'What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have done a dreadful thing.' Al-Khadir replied, 'Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me?' Moses replied, 'Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and do not be hard upon me for my fault.' So the first excuse of Moses was that he had forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, "Have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing." Al-Khadir said, "Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?' Moses said "If I ask you about anything after this, don't accompany me. You have received an excuse from me.' Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands, illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said, "These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it." Al-Khadir said, "This is the parting between you and me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient." The Prophet added, "We wished that Moses could have remained patient by virtue of which Alláh might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.")

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:616 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "(The Prophet) Moses was a shy person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of the children of Israel hurt him by saying, 'He covers his body in this way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.' Alláh wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, 'O stone! Give me my garment!' Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of what Alláh had created, and Alláh cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone with his stick. By Alláh, the stone still has some traces of the hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Alláh refers to in His Saying:-- "O you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Alláh proved his innocence of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Alláh's Sight." (33.69)

Once the Prophet distributed something (among his followers. A man said, "This distribution has not been done (with justice) seeking Alláh's Countenance." I went to the Prophet and told him (of that). He became so angry that I saw the signs of anger oh his face. Then he said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on Moses, for he was harmed more (in a worse manner) than this; yet he endured patiently."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:618 .italic}

The Angel of Death was sent to Moses when he came to Moses, Moses slapped him on the eye. The angel returned to his Lord and said, "You have sent me to a Slave who does not want to die." Alláh said, "Return to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every hair that will come under it, he will be granted one year of life." Moses said, "O Lord! What will happen after that?" Alláh replied, "Then death." Moses said, "Let it come now." Moses then requested Alláh to let him die close to the Sacred Land so much so that he would be at a distance of a stone's throw from it." Abu Huraira added, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'If I were there, I would show you his grave below the red sand hill on the side of the road."

A Muslim and a Jew quarreled. The Muslim taking an oath, said, "By Him Who has preferred Muḥammad over all people...!" The Jew said, "By Him Who has preferred Moses, over all people." The Muslim raised his hand and slapped the Jew who came to the Prophet to tell him what had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet said, "Don't give me superiority over Moses, for the people will become unconscious (on the Day of Resurrection) and I will be the first to gain consciousness to see Moses standing and holding a side of Alláh's Throne. I will not know if he has been among those people who have become unconscious; and that he has gained consciousness before me, or he has been amongst those whom Alláh has exempted."

Alláh's Apostle said, "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam. 'You are Adam whose mistake expelled you from Paradise.'

The Jew went to the Prophet and said, "O Abu-l-Qasim! I am under the assurance and contract of security, so what right does so-and-so have to slap me?" The Prophet asked the other, "Why have you slapped". He told him the whole story. The Prophet became angry, till anger appeared on his face, and said, "Don't give superiority to any prophet amongst Alláh's Prophets, for when the trumpet will be blown, everyone on the earth and in the heavens will become unconscious except those whom Alláh will exempt. The trumpet will be blown for the second time and I will be the first to be resurrected to see Moses holding Alláh's Throne. I will not know whether the unconsciousness which Moses received on the Day of Tur has been sufficient for him, or has he got up before me. And I do not say that there is anybody who is better than Yunus bin Matta."

"Are you the one who says: 'I will fast all the days and pray all the nights as long as I live?' " I said, "Yes, I have said it." He said, "You cannot do that. So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and sleep. Fast for three days a month, for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten time, and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I can do (fast) more than this." He said, "Fast on every third day. I said: I can do (fast) more than that, He said: "Fast on alternate days and this was the fasting of David which is the most moderate sort of fasting." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I can do (fast) more than that." He said, "There is nothing better than that."

He said, "If you do so, your eyes will become weak and you will get bored. So fast three days a month, for this will be the fasting of a whole year, or equal to the fasting of a whole year." I said, "I find myself able to fast more." He said, "Then fast like the fasting of (the Prophet) David who used to fast on alternate days and would not flee on facing the enemy."

The Prophet said, "Solomon (the son of) David said, 'Tonight I will sleep with seventy ladies each of whom will conceive a child who will be a knight fighting for "Alláh's Cause.' His companion said, 'If Alláh will.' But Solomon did not say so; therefore none of those women got pregnant except one who gave birth to a half child." The Prophet further said, "If the Prophet Solomon had said it (i.e. 'If Alláh will') he would have begotten children who would have fought in Alláh's Cause." Shuaib and Ibn Abi Az-Zinad said, "Ninety (women) is more correct (than seventy)."

The first said, 'But it has taken your child.' So they both carried the case before David who judged that the living child be given to the elder lady. So both of them went to Solomon bin David and informed him (of the case). He said, 'Bring me a knife so as to cut the child into two pieces and distribute it between them.' The younger lady said, 'May Alláh be merciful to you! Don't do that, for it is her (i.e. the other lady's) child.' So he gave the child to the younger lady."

When the Verse: 'Those who believe and mix not their belief with wrong.' was revealed, the Muslims felt it very hard on them and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who amongst us does not do wrong to himself?" He replied, "The Verse does not mean this. But that (wrong) means to associate others in worship to Alláh: Don't you listen to what Luqman said to his son when he was advising him," O my son! Join not others in worship with Alláh. Verily joining others in worship with Alláh is a great wrong indeed." (31.13)

It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' He replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' He said, 'Yes.' When we reached over the second heaven, I saw Yaḥyá (i.e. John) and Jesus who were cousins. Gabriel said, 'These are John (Yaḥyá) and Jesus, so greet them.' I greeted them and they returned the greeting saying, 'Welcome, O Pious Brother and Pious Prophet!' "

Abu Huraira said, "I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'There is none born among the off-spring of Adam, but Satan touches it. A child therefore, cries loudly at the time of birth because of the touch of Satan, except Mary and her child." Then Abu Huraira recited: "And I seek refuge with You for her and for her offspring from the outcast Satan" (3.36)

I heard the Prophet saying, "Mary, the daughter of 'Imran, was the best among the women (of the world of her time) and Khadija is the best amongst the women. (of this nation)."

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ashari {#4:643 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The superiority of 'Aisha to other ladies is like the superiority of Tharid (i.e. meat and bread dish) to other meals. Many men reached the level of perfection, but no woman reached such a level except Mary, the daughter of Imran and Asia, the wife of Pharaoh." Narrated Abu Huraira: I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Amongst all those women who ride camels (i.e. Arabs), the ladies of Quraish are the best. They are merciful and kind to their off-spring and the best guardians of their husbands' properties.' Abu Huraira added, "Mary the daughter of Imran never rode a camel."

Narrated by 'Ubada {#4:644 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If anyone testifies that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh Alone Who has no partners, and that Muḥammad is His Slave and His Apostle, and that Jesus is Alláh's Slave and His Apostle and His Word which He bestowed on Mary and a Spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is true, and Hell is true, Alláh will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he had done even if those deeds were few." (Junada, the sub-narrator said, " 'Ubada added, 'Such a person can enter Paradise through any of its eight gates he likes.")

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:645 .italic}

The Prophet said, "None spoke in cradle but three: (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), 'Shall I answer her or keep on praying?" (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his mother said, "O Alláh! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes." So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him, but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer, and then came to the child and said, 'O child! Who is your father?' The child replied, 'The shepherd.' (After hearing this) the people said, 'We shall rebuild your hermitage of gold,' but he said, 'No, of nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider passed by her. She said, 'O Alláh ! Make my child like him.' On that the child left her breast, and facing the rider said, 'O Alláh! Do not make me like him.' The child then started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, "As if I were now looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.") After a while the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child's mother) said, 'O Alláh! Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said, 'O Alláh! Make me like her.' When she asked why, the child replied, 'The rider is one of the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual intercourse."

The Prophet said, "I met Moses on the night of my Ascension to heaven." The Prophet then described him saying, as I think, "He was a tall person with lank hair as if he belonged to the people of the tribe of Shanu's.' The Prophet further said, "I met Jesus." The Prophet described him saying, "He was one of moderate height and was red-faced as if he had just come out of a bathroom. I saw Abraham whom I resembled more than any of his children did." The Prophet further said, "(That night) I was given two cups; one full of milk and the other full of wine. I was asked to take either of them which I liked, and I took the milk and drank it. On that it was said to me, 'You have taken the right path (religion). If you had taken the wine, your (Muslim) nation would have gone astray."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:648 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I saw Moses, Jesus and Abraham (on the night of my Ascension to the heavens). Jesus was of red complexion, curly hair and a broad chest. Moses was of brown complexion, straight hair and tall stature as if he was from the people of Az-Zutt."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:649 .italic}

The Prophet mentioned the Massiah Ad-Dajjal in front of the people saying, Alláh is not one eyed while Messsiah, Ad-Dajjal is blind in the right eye and his eye looks like a bulging out grape. While sleeping near the Ka'ba last night, I saw in my dream a man of brown color the best one can see amongst brown color and his hair was long that it fell between his shoulders. His hair was lank and water was dribbling from his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men while circumambulating the Kaba. I asked, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'This is Jesus, son of Mary.' Behind him I saw a man who had very curly hair and was blind in the right eye, resembling Ibn Qatan (i.e. an infidel) in appearance. He was placing his hands on the shoulders of a person while performing Tawaf around the Ka'ba. I asked, 'Who is this? 'They replied, 'The Masih, Ad-Dajjal.' "

Narrated by Salim from his father {#4:650 .italic}

No, By Alláh, the Prophet did not tell that Jesus was of red complexion but said, "While I was asleep circumambulating the Ka'ba (in my dream), suddenly I saw a man of brown complexion and lank hair walking between two men, and water was dropping from his head. I asked, 'Who is this?' The people said, 'He is the son of Mary.' Then I looked behind and I saw a red-complexioned, fat, curly-haired man, blind in the right eye which looked like a bulging out grape. I asked, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'He is Ad-Dajjal.' The one who resembled to him among the people, was Ibn Qatar." (Az-Zuhri said, "He (i.e. Ibn Qatan) was a man from the tribe Khuza'a who died in the pre-lslamic period.")

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:651 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "I am the nearest of all the people to the son of Mary, and all the prophets are paternal brothers, and there has been no prophet between me and him (i.e. Jesus)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:652 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all the people to Jesus, the son of Mary. The prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one."

I heard the Prophet saying, "Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the son of Mary, for I am only a Slave. So, call me the Slave of Alláh and His Apostle."

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari {#4:655 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "If a person teaches his slave girl good manners properly, educates her properly, and then manumits and marries her, he will get a double reward. And if a man believes in Jesus and then believes in me, he will get a double reward. And if a slave fears his Lord (i.e. Alláh) and obeys his masters, he too will get a double reward."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:656 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "You will be resurrected (and assembled) bare-footed, naked and uncircumcised." The Prophet then recited the Divine Verse:-- "As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it: A promise We have undertaken. Truly we shall do it." (21.104) He added, "The first to be dressed will be Abraham. Then some of my companions will take to the right and to the left. I will say: 'My companions! 'It will be said, 'They had been renegades since you left them.' I will then say what the Pious Slave Jesus, the son of Mary said: 'And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them; when You did take me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things. If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if you forgive them, You, only You are the All-Mighty the All-Wise.' " (5.117-118) Narrated Quaggas, "Those were the apostates who renegade from Islam during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr who fought them".

Alláh's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely (Jesus,) the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly (as a Just Ruler); he will break the Cross and kill the pigs and there will be no Jizya (i.e. taxation taken from non Muslims). Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it, and a single prostration to Alláh (in prayer) will be better than the whole world and whatever is in it." Abu Huraira added "If you wish, you can recite (this verse of the Holy Book): 'And there is none Of the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) But must believe in him (i.e Jesus as an Apostle of Alláh and a human being) Before his death. And on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness Against them." (4.159) (See Fateh Al Bari, Page 302 Vol 7)

Narrated by Rabi bin Hirash {#4:659 .italic}

'Uqba bin 'Amr said to Hudhaifa, "Won't you relate to us of what you have heard from Alláh's Apostle ?" He said, "I heard him saying, "When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in reality, it will be fresh cold water." Hudhaifa added, "I also heard him saying, 'From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done any good deed.' He replied, 'I don't remember any good deed.' He was asked to think it over. He said, 'I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So Alláh made him enter Paradise." Hudhaifa further said, "I also heard him saying, 'Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did so, but Alláh collected his particles and asked him: Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Alláh forgave him." 'Uqba bin 'Amr said, "I heard him saying that the Israeli used to dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds)."

Narrated by 'Aisha and Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:660 .italic}

On his death-bed Alláh's Apostle put a sheet over his-face and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and removing the sheet) he said, "May Alláh's Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets." (By that) he intended to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:661 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Israelis used to be ruled and guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number." The people asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?" He said, "Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e. the Caliphs) rights, for Alláh will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Alláh has put under their guardianship."

Narrated by Abu Said {#4:662 .italic}

The Prophet said, "You will follow the wrong ways, of your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a mastigure, you too will go there." We said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do you mean the Jews and the Christians?" He replied, "Whom else?" (Meaning, of course, the Jews and the Christians.)

Narrated by Anas {#4:663 .italic}

The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, "Pronounce the words of the Adhan (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only."

That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:665 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Your period (i.e. the Muslims' period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between the 'Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, 'Who will work for me till midday for one Qirat each?' The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each. The person asked, 'Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the 'Asr (prayer) for one Qirat each?' The Christians worked from midday till the 'Asr prayer for one Qirat. Then the person asked, 'Who will do the work for me from the 'Asr till sunset for two Qirats each?' " The Prophet added, "It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, 'We have done more work but got less wages.' Alláh said, 'Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?' They said, 'No.' So Alláh said, 'Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:666 .italic}

I heard ‘Umar saying, "May Alláh Curse so-and-so! Doesn't he know that the Prophet said, 'May Alláh curse the Jews for, though they were forbidden (to eat) fat, they liquefied it and sold it. "

The Prophet said, "Convey (my teachings) to the people even if it were a single sentence, and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:668 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Jews and the Christians do not dye (their grey hair), so you shall do the opposite of what they do (i.e. dye your grey hair and beards)."

Narrated by Jundub {#4:669 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Amongst the nations before you there was a man who got a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop till he died. Alláh said, 'My Slave hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.' "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:670 .italic}

That he heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Alláh willed to test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, 'What thing do you like most?' He replied, "Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.' The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin. The angel asked him, 'What kind of property do you like best?' He replied, 'Camels (or cows).' (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant she-camei, and the angel said (to him), 'May Alláh bless you in it.' The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, 'What thing do you like most?' He said, 'I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.' The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), 'What kind of property do you like bests' He replied, 'Cows,' The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, 'May Alláh bless you in it.' The angel went to the blind man and asked, 'What thing do you like best?' He said, '(I like) that Alláh may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.' The angel touched his eyes and Alláh gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him, "What kind of property do you like best?' He replied, 'Sheep.' The angel gave him a pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Alláh and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, 'I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).' The angel said, 'I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren't you a poor man, and then Alláh gave you (all this property).' He replied, '(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my fore-fathers' The angel said, 'If you are telling a lie, then let Alláh make you as you were before. ' Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, 'If you are telling a lie, then let Alláh make you as you were before.' The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, 'I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Alláh, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey' The man said, 'No doubt, I was blind and Alláh gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Alláh made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Alláh, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Alláh's sake.' The angel replied, 'Keep your property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Alláh is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:671 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Once three persons (from the previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each other, 'O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Alláh's Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining Alláh's Pleasure).' So one of them said, 'O Alláh! You know that I had a laborer who worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), 'Go to those cows and drive them away.' He said to me, 'But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,' I said to him, 'Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).' So he drove them. O Alláh! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the rock.' The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, 'O Alláh, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Alláh! If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.' So the rock shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, 'O Alláh! You know that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle's daughter) who was most beloved to me and I sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, 'Be afraid of Alláh, and do not deflower me but legally. 'I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Alláh! If You consider that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Alláh saved them and they came out (of the cave)." (This Ḥadít_h indicates that one can only ask Alláh for help directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Alláh through dead or absent prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it is a kind of disbelief.)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:672 .italic}

That he heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "While a lady was nursing her child, a rider passed by and she said, 'O Alláh! Don't let my child die till he becomes like this (rider).' The child said, 'O Alláh! Don't make me like him,' and then returned to her breast (sucking it). (After a while) they passed by a lady who was being pulled and teased (by the people). The child's mother said, 'O Alláh! Do not make my child like her.' The child said, 'O Alláh! Make me like her.' Then he said, 'As for the rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely) and she says: Alláh is sufficient for me (He knows the truth)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:673 .italic}

The Prophet said, "While a dog was going round a well and was about to die of thirst, an Israeli prostitute saw it and took off her shoe and watered it. So Alláh forgave her because of that good deed."

That he heard Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan (talking) on the pulpit in the year when he performed the Hajj. He took a tuft of hair that was in the hand of an orderly and said, "O people of Medina! Where are your learned men? I heard the Prophet forbidding such a thing as this (i.e. false hair) and he used to say, 'The Israelis were destroyed when their ladies practiced this habit (of using false hair to lengthen their locks)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:675 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Amongst the people preceding you there used to be 'Muhaddithun' (i.e. persons who can guess things that come true later on, as if those persons have been inspired by a divine power), and if there are any such persons amongst my followers, it is ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#4:676 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Amongst the men of Bani Israel there was a man who had murdered ninety-nine persons. Then he set out asking (whether his repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Alláh ordered the village (towards which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come), to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going to). So he was forgiven."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:677 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle; offered the morning prayer and then faced the people and said, "While a man was driving a cow, he suddenly rode over it and beat it. The cow said, "We have not been created for this, but we have been created for sloughing." On that the people said astonishingly, "Glorified be Alláh! A cow speaks!" The Prophet said, "I believe this, and Abu Bakr and ‘Umar too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, 'You have saved it from me; but who will guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except me (because of riots and afflictions)? ' " The people said surprisingly, "Glorified be Alláh! A wolf speaks!" The Prophet said, "But I believe this, and Abu Bakr and ‘Umar too, believe this, although neither of them was present there." (See the Foot-note of page No. 10 Vol.5)

Alláh's Apostle said, "A man bought a piece of and from another man, and the buyer found an earthenware jar filled with gold in the land. The buyer said to the seller. 'Take your gold, as I have bought only the land from you, but I have not bought the gold from you.' The (former) owner of the land said, "I have sold you the land with everything in it.' So both of them took their case before a man who asked, 'Do you have children?' One of them said, "I have a boy.' The other said, "I have a girl.' The man said, 'Marry the girl to the boy and spend the money on both of them and give the rest of it in charity.' "

Narrated by Usama bin Zaid {#4:679 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Plague was a means of torture sent on a group of Israelis (or on some people before you). So if you hear of its spread in a land, don't approach it, and if a plague should appear in a land where you are present, then don't leave that land in order to run away from it (i.e. plague)."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:680 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) I asked Alláh's Apostle about the plague. He told me that it was a Punishment sent by Alláh on whom he wished, and Alláh made it a source of mercy for the believers, for if one in the time of an epidemic plague stays in his country patiently hoping for Alláh's Reward and believing that nothing will befall him except what Alláh has written for him, he will get the reward of a martyr."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:681 .italic}

The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, "Who will intercede for her with Alláh's Apostle?" Some said, "No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Alláh's Apostle ." When Usama spoke about that to Alláh's Apostle Alláh's Apostle said, (to him), "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Alláh's Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Alláh's Legal punishment on him. By Alláh, if Fatima, the daughter of Muḥammad stole, I would cut off her hand."

Narrated by Ibn Mas'ud {#4:682 .italic}

I heard a person reciting a (Qur’ánic) Verse in a certain way, and I had heard the Prophet reciting the same Verse in a different way. So I took him to the Prophet and informed him of that but I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face, and then he said, "Both of you are correct, so don't differ, for the nations before you differed, so they were destroyed."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:683 .italic}

As if I saw the Prophet talking about one of the prophets whose nation had beaten him and caused him to bleed, while he was cleaning the blood off his face and saying, "O Alláh! Forgive my nation, for they have no knowledge."

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd {#4:684 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Amongst the people preceding your age, there was a man whom Alláh had given a lot of money. While he was in his death-bed, he called his sons and said, 'What type of father have I been to you? They replied, 'You have been a good father.' He said, 'I have never done a single good deed; so when I die, burn me, crush my body, and scatter the resulting ashes on a windy day.'

When the fire has eaten my flesh and reached my bones, take the bones and grind them and scatter the resulting powder in the sea on a hot (or windy) day.' (That was done.)

When he died, his sons did accordingly. Alláh ordered the earth saying, 'Collect what you hold of his particles.' It did so, and behold! There he was (the man) standing.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:699 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "You see that the people are of different natures. Those who were the best in the pre-lslamic period, are also the best in Islam if they comprehend religious knowledge. You see that the best amongst the people in this respect (i.e. ambition of ruling) are those who hate it most. And you see that the worst among people is the double faced (person) who appears to these with one face and to the others with another face (i.e a hypocrite)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:700 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The tribe of Quraish has precedence over the people in this connection (i.e the right of ruling). The Muslims follow the Muslims amongst them, and the infidels follow the infidels amongst them. People are of different natures: The best amongst them in the pre-lslamic period are the best in Islam provided they comprehend the religious knowledge. You will find that the best amongst the people in this respect (i.e. of ruling) is he who hates it (i.e. the idea of ruling) most, till he is given the pledge of allegiance."

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Pride and arrogance are characteristics of the rural bedouins while calmness is found among the owners of sheep. Belief is Yemenite, and wisdom is also Yemenite i.e. the Yemenites are well-known for their true belief and wisdom)." Abu ‘Abdu’lláh (Al-Bukhari) said, "Yemen was called so because it is situated to the right of the Ka'ba, and Sham was called so because it is situated to the left of the Ka'ba."

Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make the people go astray, for I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'Authority of ruling will remain with Quraish, and whoever bears hostility to them, Alláh will destroy him as long as they abide by the laws of the religion.' "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:705 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair was the most beloved person to 'Aisha excluding the Prophet and Abu Bakr, and he in his turn, was the most devoted to her, 'Aisha used not to withhold the money given to her by Alláh, but she used to spend it in charity. (‘Abdu’lláh) bin AzZubair said, " 'Aisha should be stopped from doing so." (When 'Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, "Shall I be stopped from doing so? I vow that I will never talk to ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair." On that, Ibn Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Alláh's Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles of the Prophet, including 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin 'Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama said to him, "When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house along with us (without taking her leave)." He did accordingly (and she accepted their intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not keeping) her vow. 'Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted forty slaves. She said, "I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily."

'Uthman said to the three Quraishi persons. " If you differ with Zaid bin Thabit on any point of the Qur’án, then write it in the language of Quraish, as the Qur’án was revealed in their language." So they acted accordingly. (Said bin Thabit was an Ansari and not from Quraish ).

Therefore we would like you to give us some instructions which we may follow and convey to our people staying behind us." The Prophet said, "I order you to observe four things and forbid you (to do) four things: (I order you) to believe in Alláh testifying that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh; to offer the prayer perfectly; to pay the Zakat; and to give one-fifth of the war booty to Alláh.

We were in the company of the Prophet in a Ghazwa. A large number of emigrants joined him and among the emigrants there was a person who used to play jokes (or play with spears); so he (jokingly) stroked an Ansari man on the hip. The Ans-ari got so angry that both of them called their people. The Ansari said, "Help, O Ansar!" And the emigrant said "Help, O emigrants!" The Prophet came out and said, "What is wrong with the people (as they are calling) this call of the period of Ignorance? "Then he said, "What is the matter with them?" So he was told about the stroke of the emigrant to the Ansari. The Prophet said, "Stop this (i.e. appeal for help) for it is an evil call. "‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul (a hypocrite) said, "The emigrants have called and (gathered against us); so when we return to Medina, surely, the more honorable people will expel therefrom the meaner," Upon that ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Prophet!

When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu Dhar, he said to his brother, "Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven. Listen to him and then come to me." His brother set out till he met the Prophet and listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, "I have seen him exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry." Abu Dhar said, "You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted." So, he took his journey-food and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when ‘Alí saw him and realized that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was night, when he returned to his sleeping place. ‘Alí again passed by him and said, "Hasn't the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?" So, ‘Alí let him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about anything, till it was the third day when ‘Alí had the same experience with him and Abu Dhar again stayed with him. ‘Alí then asked, "Won't you tell me what has brought you here?" He replied, "If you give me a promise and a convention that you will guide me, then I will tell you." When ‘Alí did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his purpose). ‘Alí said, "It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muḥammad) is the Apostle of Alláh. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter." Abu Dhur agreed and followed ‘Alí till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very spot. The Prophet said to him, "Go back to your people and inform them (of this religion) till you receive my (further) orders." Abu Dhur said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. infidels)." He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as possible, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and that Muḥammad is the Apostle of Alláh." The people then got up and beat him till they knocked him down. Al-‘Abbás came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to you! Don't you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?" Thus he saved him from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and Al-‘Abbás drew himself over him (to save him as before).

Narrated by Abu Jamra {#4:725 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás said to us, "Shall I tell you the story of Abu Dhar's conversion to Islam?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Abu Dhar said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca, claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, 'Go to that man and talk to him and bring me his news.' He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, 'What is the news with you?' He said, 'By Alláh, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.' I said to him, 'You have not satisfied me with this little information.' So, I took a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and staying in the Mosque. Then ‘Alí passed by me and said, 'It seems you are a stranger?' I said, 'Yes.' He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. ‘Alí passed by me again and asked, 'Hasn't the man recognized his dwelling place yet' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Come along with me.' He asked me, 'What is your business? What has brought you to this town?' I said to him, 'If you keep my secret, I will tell you.' He said, 'I will do,' I said to him, 'We have heard that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally.' ‘Alí said (to Abu Dhar), 'You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.' ‘Alí proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, 'Present (the principles of) Islam to me.' When he did, I embraced Islam 'immediately. He said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. ' I said, 'By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),' Abu Dhar went to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, 'O folk of Quraish ! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, and I (also) testify that Muḥammad is Alláh's Slave and His Apostle.' (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, 'Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !' They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al ‘Abbás saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, 'Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar?' They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, 'Get at this Sabi!' I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-‘Abbás found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before.' So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Alláh be Merciful to him) to Islam."

I heard Anas bin Malik describing the Prophet saying, "He was of medium height amongst the people, neither tall nor short; he had a rosy color, neither absolutely white nor deep brown; his hair was neither completely curly nor quite lank. Divine Inspiration was revealed to him when he was forty years old. He stayed ten years in Mecca receiving the Divine Inspiration, and stayed in Medina for ten more years. When he expired, he had scarcely twenty white hairs in his head and beard." Rabi'a said, "I saw some of his hairs and it was red. When I asked about that, I was told that it turned red because of scent. "

Narrated by Anas {#4:748 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was neither very tall nor short, neither absolutely white nor deep brown. His hair was neither curly nor lank. Alláh sent him (as an Apostle) when he was forty years old.

Once Alláh's Apostle went to Al-Batha' at noon, performed the ablution and offered' a two Rakat Zuhr prayer and a two-Rak'at 'Asr prayer while a spearheaded stick was planted before him and the passersby were passing in front of it. (After the prayer), the people got up and held the hands of the Prophet and passed them on their faces. I also took his hand and kept it on my face and noticed that it was colder than ice, and its smell was nicer than musk.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:754 .italic}

The Prophet was the most generous of all the people, and he used to become more generous in Ramaḍán when Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night during Ramaḍán to revise the Qur’án with him. Alláh's Apostle then used to be more generous than the fast wind.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:755 .italic}

That Alláh's Apostle came to her in a happy mood with his features glittering with joy, and said, "Have you not heard what the Qaif has said about Zaid and Us-ama? He saw their feet and remarked. These belong to each other." (i.e. They are father and son.)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ka'b {#4:756 .italic}

I heard Ka'b bin Malik talking after his failure to join (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk.

Then Alláh's Apostle parted his hair.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#4:759 .italic}

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:760 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle was given the choice of one of two matters, he would choose the easier of the two, as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful to do so, he would not approach it. Alláh's Apostle never took revenge (over anybody) for his own sake but (he did) only when Alláh's Legal Bindings were outraged in which case he would take revenge for Alláh's Sake.

Narrated by Anas {#4:766 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle did not use to raise his hands in his invocations except in the Istisqa (i.e. invoking Alláh for the rain) in which he used to raise his hands so high that one could see the whiteness of his armpits. (Note: It may be that Anas did not see the prophet (as) raising his hands but it has been narrated that the Prophet (as) used to raise his hands for invocations other than Istisqa. See Ḥadít_h No. 612 Vol. 5. and Ḥadít_h No. 807 & 808 Vol 2.)

Narrated by Abu Juhaifa {#4:767 .italic}

By chance I went to the Prophet at noon while he was at Al-Abtah (resting) in a tent. Bilal came out (of the tent) and pronounced the Adhan for the prayer, and entering again, he brought out the water which was left after Alláh's Apostle had performed the ablution. The people rushed to take some of the water. Bilal again went in and brought out a spear-headed stick, and then Alláh's Apostle came out. As if I were now looking at the whiteness of his leg. Bilal fixed the stick and the Prophet offered a two-Rakat Zuhr prayer and a two-Rak'at 'Asr prayer, while women and donkeys were passing in front of the Prophet (beyond the stick) .

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:768 .italic}

The Prophet used to talk so clearly that if somebody wanted to count the number of his words, he could do so. Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair: 'Aisha said (to me), "Don't you wonder at Abu so-and-so who came and sat by my dwelling and started relating the traditions of Alláh's Apostle intending to let me hear that, while I was performing an optional prayer. He left before I finished my optional prayer. Had I found him still there. I would have said to him, 'Alláh's Apostle never talked so quickly and vaguely as you do.' "

Narrated by Abu Salama bin 'Abdur-Rahman {#4:769 .italic}

That he asked 'Aisha "How was the prayer of Alláh's Apostle in the month of Ramaḍán?" She replied, "He used not to pray more than eleven Rakat whether in Ramaḍán or in any other month. He used to offer four Rakat, let alone their beauty and length, and then four Rakat, let alone their beauty and length. Afterwards he would offer three Rakat. I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Do you go to bed before offering the Witr prayer?' He said, 'My eyes sleep, but my heart does not sleep."'

Narrated by Sharik bin ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Namr {#4:770 .italic}

I heard Anas bin Malik telling us about the night when the Prophet was made to travel from the Ka'ba Mosque. Three persons (i.e. angels) came to the Prophet before he was divinely inspired was an Aspostle), while he was sleeping in Al Masjid-ul-Haram. The first (of the three angels) said, "Which of them is he?" The second said, "He is the best of them." That was all that happened then, and he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along with him to the Heaven.

Narrated by Imran bin Ḥusayn {#4:771 .italic}

That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr. Alláh's Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself. ‘Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet's head and started saying: Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while) he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), "O so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?" He replied, "I am Junub," Alllah's Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man then offered the prayer. Alláh's Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him. We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her, "Where can we get water?" She replied, "Oh ! There is no water." We asked, "how far is your house from the water?" She replied, "A distance of a day and a night travel." We said, "Come on to Alláh's Apostle, "She asked, "What is Alláh's Apostle ?" So we brought her to Alláh's Apostle against her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The Prophet then said, "Bring what (foodstuff) you have." So some dates and pieces of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, "I have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim." So Alláh guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all embraced Islam.

Narrated by Anas {#4:772 .italic}

A bowl of water was brought to the Prophet while he was at Az-Zawra. He placed his hand in it and the water started flowing among his fingers. All the people performed ablution (with that water). Qatada asked Anas, "How many people were you?" Anas replied, "Three hundred or nearly three-hundred."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:773 .italic}

I saw Alláh's Apostle at the 'time when the Asr prayer was due. Then the people were searching for water for ablution but they could not find any. Then some water was brought to Alláh's Apostle and he placed his hand in the pot and ordered the people to perform the ablution with the water. I saw water flowing from underneath his fingers and the people started performing the ablution till all of them did it.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:774 .italic}

The Prophet went out on one of his journeys with some of his companions. They went on walking till the time of the prayer became due. They could not find water to perform the ablution. One of them went away and brought a little amount of water in a pot. The Prophet took it and performed the ablution, and then stretched his four fingers on to the pot and said (to the people), "Get up to perform the ablution." They started performing the ablution till all of them did it, and they were seventy or so persons.

Narrated by Humaid {#4:775 .italic}

Anas bin Malik said, "Once the time of the prayer became due and the people whose houses were close to the Mosque went to their houses to perform ablution, while the others remained (sitting there). A stone pot containing water was brought to the Prophet, who wanted to put his hand in it, but It was too small for him to spread his hand in it, and so he had to bring his fingers together before putting his hand in the pot. Then all the people performed the ablution (with that water)." I asked Anas, "How many persons were they." He replied, "There were eighty men."

Narrated by Salim bin Abi Aj-Jad {#4:776 .italic}

Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh said, "The people became very thirsty on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty). A small pot containing some water was in front of the Prophet and when he had finished the ablution, the people rushed towards him. He asked, 'What is wrong with you?' They replied, 'We have no water either for performing ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.' So he placed his hand in that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and performed ablution (from it)." I asked Jabir, "How many were you?" he replied, "Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for us, but we were fifteen-hundred."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#4:777 .italic}

We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet sat at the edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it out into the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:778 .italic}

Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, "I have noticed feebleness in the voice of Alláh's Apostle which I think, is caused by hunger. Have you got any food?" She said, "Yes." She brought out some loaves of barley and took out a veil belonging to her, and wrapped the bread in part of it and put it under my arm and wrapped part of the veil round me and sent me to Alláh's Apostle. I went carrying it and found Alláh's Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there, Alláh's Apostle asked, "Has Abu Talha sent you?" I said, "Yes". He asked, "With some food? I said, "Yes" Alláh's Apostle then said to the men around him, "Get up!" He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet's visit). Abu Talha said, "O Um Sulaim! Alláh's Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them." She said, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." So Abu Talha went out to receive Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Alláh's Apostle said, "O Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have." She brought the bread which Alláh's Apostle ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin. Then Alláh's Apostle recited what Alláh wished him to recite, and then said, "Let ten persons come (to share the meal)." Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he again said, "Let another ten do the same." They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he again said, '"'Let another ten persons (do the same.)" They were admitted, ate their fill and went out. Then he said, "Let another ten persons come." In short, all of them ate their fill, and they were seventy or eighty men.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:779 .italic}

We used to consider miracles as Alláh's Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Alláh's Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, "Bring the water remaining with you." The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, "Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Alláh." I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Alláh's Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Alláh, when it was being eaten (by him).

Narrated by Jabir {#4:780 .italic}

My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and said, "My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me." The Prophet went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Alláh), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, "Measure (for them)." He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them.

Narrated by Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr {#4:781 .italic}

The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once said, "Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or said something similar)." Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten. And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the sub-narrator is in doubt whether 'Abdur-Rahman said, "My wife and my servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr's house.") Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and stayed there till he offered the 'Isha' prayers. He returned and stayed till Alláh's Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his house. His wife said to him, "What has detained you from your guests?" He said, "Have you served supper to them?" She said, "They refused to take supper) until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but they refused (to eat)" I went to hide myself and he said, "O Ghunthar!" He invoked Alláh to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please eat!" and added, I will never eat the meal." By Alláh, whenever we took a handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife, "O sister of Bani Firas!" She said, "O pleasure of my eyes. The food has been tripled in quantity." Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, "It (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all." He took a handful from it, and carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Alláh knows how many men were under the command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all of them ate of that meal.

Narrated by Anas {#4:782 .italic}

Once during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle, the people of Medina suffered from drought. So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a man got up saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you invoke Alláh to bless us with rain?" The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked. The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The houses have collapsed; please invoke Alláh to withhold the rain." On that the Prophet smiled and said, "O Alláh, (let it rain) around us and not on us." I then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#4:783 .italic}

The Prophet used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#4:784 .italic}

The Prophet used to stand by a tree or a date-palm on Friday. Then an Ansari woman or man said. "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we make a pulpit for you?" He replied, "If you wish." So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, "It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:785 .italic}

That he heard Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh saying, "The roof of the Mosque was built over trunks of date-palms working as pillars. When the Prophet delivered a sermon, he used to stand by one of those trunks till the pulpit was made for him, and he used it instead. Then we heard the trunk sending a sound like of a pregnant she-camel till the Prophet came to it, and put his hand over it, then it became quiet."

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#4:786 .italic}

Once ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said, said, "Who amongst you remembers the statement of Alláh's Apostle regarding the afflictions?" Hudhaifa replied, "I remember what he said exactly." ‘Umar said. "Tell (us), you are really a daring man!'' Hudhaifa said, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'A man's afflictions (i.e. wrong deeds) concerning his relation to his family, his property and his neighbors are expiated by his prayers, giving in charity and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.' " ‘Umar said, "I don't mean these afflictions but the afflictions that will be heaving up and down like waves of the sea." Hudhaifa replied, "O chief of the believers! You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door between you and them." ‘Umar asked, "Will that door be opened or broken?" Hudhaifa replied, "No, it will be broken." ‘Umar said, "Then it is very likely that the door will not be closed again." Later on the people asked Hudhaifa, "Did ‘Umar know what that door meant?" He said. "Yes, ‘Umar knew it as everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated to ‘Umar an authentic narration, not lies." We dared not ask Hudhaifa; therefore we requested Masruq who asked him, "What does the door stand for?" He said, "‘Umar."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:787 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Hour will not be established till you fight a nation wearing hairy shoes, and till you fight the Turks, who will have small eyes, red faces and flat noses; and their faces will be like flat shields. And you will find that the best people are those who hate responsibility of ruling most of all till they are chosen to be the rulers. And the people are of different natures: The best in the pre-lslamic period are the best in Islam. A time will come when any of you will love to see me rather than to have his family and property doubled."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:788 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Hour will not be established till you fight with the Khudh and the Kirmán from among the non-Arabs. They will be of red faces, flat noses and small eyes; their faces will look like flat shields, and their shoes will be of hair."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:789 .italic}

I enjoyed the company of Alláh's Apostle for three years, and during the other years of my life, never was I so anxious to understand the (Prophet's) traditions as I was during those three years. I heard him saying, beckoning with his hand in this way, "Before the Hour you will fight with people who will have hairy shoes and live in Al-Bariz." (Sufyan, the sub-narrator once said, "And they are the people of Al-Bazir.")

Narrated by ‘Umar bin Taghlib {#4:790 .italic}

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#4:792 .italic}

The Prophet said, "A time will come when the people will wage holy war, and it will be asked, 'Is there any amongst you who has enjoyed the company of Alláh's Apostle?' They will say: 'Yes.' And then victory will be bestowed upon them. They will wage holy war again, and it will be asked: 'Is there any among you who has enjoyed the company of the companions of Alláh's Apostle ?' They will say: 'Yes.' And then victory will be bestowed on them."

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#4:793 .italic}

While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, "Adi! Have you been to Al-Hira?" I said, "I haven't been to it, but I was informed about it." He said, "If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, fearing none but Alláh." I said to myself, "What will happen to the robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?" The Prophet further said. "If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be opened (and taken as spoils)." I asked, "You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?" He said, "Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Alláh, will meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Alláh to interpret for him, and Alláh will say to him: 'Didn't I send a messenger to teach you?' He will say: 'Yes.' Alláh will say: 'Didn't I give you wealth and do you favors?' He will say: 'Yes.' Then he will look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but Hell." 'Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, "Save yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word." 'Adi added: (later on) I saw a lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, fearing none but Alláh. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau, son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had said: 'A person will come out with a handful. of gold...etc.

The Prophet once came out and offered the funeral prayer for the martyrs of Uhud, and proceeded to the pulpit and said, "I shall be your predecessor and a witness on you, and I am really looking at my sacred Fount now, and no doubt, I have been given the keys of the treasures of the world. By Alláh, I am not afraid that you will worship others along with Alláh, but I am afraid that you will envy and fight one another for worldly fortunes."

Today a hole has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog as large as this." pointing with two of his fingers making a circle. Zainab said, "I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though amongst us there are pious people? ' He said, 'Yes, if evil increases." Narrated Um Salama: The Prophet woke up and said, "Glorified be Alláh: What great (how many) treasures have been sent down, and what great (how many ) afflictions have been sent down!"

Narrated by Sasaa {#4:798 .italic}

Abu Said Al-Khudr said to me, "I notice that you like sheep and you keep them; so take care of them and their food, for I have heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'A time will come upon the people when the best of a Muslim's property will be sheep, which he will take to the tops of mountains and to the places of rain-falls to run away with his religion in order to save it from afflictions.' "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:799 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "There will be afflictions (and at the time) the sitting person will be better than the standing one, and the standing one will be better than the walking, and the walking will be better than the running. And whoever will look towards those afflictions, they will overtake him, and whoever will find a refuge or a shelter, should take refuge in it." The same narration is reported by Abu Bakr, with the addition, "(The Prophet said), 'Among the prayers there is a prayer the missing of which will be to one like losing one's family and property."

The Prophet said, "Soon others will be preferred to you, and there will be things which you will not like." The companions of the Prophet asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What do you order us to do (in this case)? " He said, "(I order you) to give the rights that are on you and to ask your rights from Alláh."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:801 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "This branch from Quraish will ruin the people." The companions of the Prophet asked, "What do you order us to do (then)?" He said, "I would suggest that the people keep away from them.''

Narrated by Said Al-Umawi {#4:802 .italic}

I was with Marwan and Abu Huraira and heard Abu Huraira saying, "I heard the trustworthy, truly inspired one (i.e. the Prophet ) saying, 'The destruction of my followers will be brought about by the hands of some youngsters from Quraish." Marwan asked, "Youngsters?" Abu Huraira said, "If you wish, I would name them: They are the children of so-and-so and the children of so-and-so."

Narrated by Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman {#4:803 .italic}

The people used to ask Alláh's Apostle about good, but I used to ask him about evil for fear that it might overtake me. Once I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We were in ignorance and in evil and Alláh has bestowed upon us the present good; will there by any evil after this good?" He said, "Yes." I asked, "Will there be good after that evil?" He said, "Yes, but it would be tained with Dakhan (i.e. Little evil)." I asked, "What will its Dakhan be?" He said, "There will be some people who will lead (people) according to principles other than my tradition. You will see their actions and disapprove of them." I said, "Will there by any evil after that good?" He said, "Yes, there will be some people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation to it will be thrown in it (by them)." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Describe those people to us." He said, "They will belong to us and speak our language" I asked, "What do you order me to do if such a thing should take place in my life?" He said, "Adhere to the group of Muslims and their Chief." I asked, "If there is neither a group (of Muslims) nor a chief (what shall I do)?" He said, "Keep away from all those different sects, even if you had to bite (i.e. eat) the root of a tree, till you meet Alláh while you are still in that state."

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#4:804 .italic}

My companions learned (something about) good (through asking the Prophet while I learned (something about) evil.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:805 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Day of (Judgment) will not be established till there is a war between two groups whose claims (or religion) will be the same."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:806 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Hour will not be established till there is a war between two groups among whom there will be a great number of casualties, though the claims (or religion) of both of them will be one and the same. And the Hour will not be established till there appear about thirty liars, all of whom will be claiming to be the messengers of Alláh. "

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#4:807 .italic}

While we were with Alláh's Apostle who was distributing (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do Justice." The Prophet said, "Woe to you! Who could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice." ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off." The Prophet said, "Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur’án but it does not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an arrow goes through a victim's body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow's blade, would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman's breast or a lump of meat moving loosely. Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people." I testify that I heard this narration from Alláh's Apostle and I testify that ‘Alí bin Abi Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him.

Narrated by ‘Alí {#4:808 .italic}

I relate the traditions of Alláh's Apostle to you for I would rather fall from the sky than attribute something to him falsely. But when I tell you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur’án) and they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief), so wherever you meet them, kill them, for he who kills them shall get a reward on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by Khabbab bin Al-Arat {#4:809 .italic}

We complained to Alláh's Apostle (of the persecution inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka'ba, leaning over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, "Would you seek help for us? Would you pray to Alláh for us?" He said, "Among the nations before you a (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Alláh, this religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will fear none but Alláh, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#4:810 .italic}

The Prophet noticed the absence of Thabit bin Qais. A man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I shall bring you his news." So he went to him and saw him sitting in his house drooping his head (sadly). He asked Thabit, "What's the matter?" Thabit replied, "An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the people of Hell." The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, "The man went to Thabit again with glad tidings)." The Prophet said to him, "Go and say to Thabit: 'You are not from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise."

Narrated by Al-Bara' bin 'Azib {#4:811 .italic}

A man recited Surat-al-Kahf (in his prayer) and in the house there was a (riding) animal which got frightened and started jumping. The man finished his prayer with Taslim, but behold! A mist or a cloud hovered over him. He informed the Prophet of that and the Prophet said, "O so-and-so! Recite, for this (mist or cloud) was a sign of peace descending for the recitation of Qur’án."

Narrated by Al-Bara' bin 'Azib {#4:812 .italic}

Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a saddle from him. He said to 'Azib. "Tell your son to carry it with me." So I carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My father said, "O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with Alláh's Apostle (during Migration)." He said, "Yes, we travelled the whole night and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said, 'Sleep, O Alláh's Apostle, and I will guard you.' So he slept and I went out to guard him. Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we had when we came to it. I asked (him). 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He replied, 'I belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.' I said, 'Do your sheep have milk?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you milk for us?' He said, 'Yes.' He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara' striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was cold. Then I said, 'Drink, O Alláh's Apostle!' He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked, 'Has the time for our departure come?' I said, 'Yes.' So we departed after midday. Suraqa bin Malik followed us and I said, 'We have been discovered, O Alláh's Apostle!' He said, Don't grieve for Alláh is with us.' The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not sure whether Abu Bakr said, "(It sank) into solid earth.") Suraqa said, 'I see that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Alláh, I will cause those who are seeking after you to return.' The Prophet invoked good on him and he was saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, 'I have looked for him here in vain.' So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his promise."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:813 .italic}

The Prophet paid a visit to a sick bedouin. The Prophet when visiting a patient used to say, "No harm will befall you! May Alláh cure you! May Alláh cure you!" So the Prophet said to the bedouin. "No harm will befall you. May Alláh cure you!" The bedouin said, "You say, may Alláh cure me? No, for it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the grave." The Prophet said, "Yes, then may it be as you say."

Narrated by Anas {#4:814 .italic}

There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: "Muḥammad knows nothing but what I have written for him." Then Alláh caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, "This is the act of Muḥammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them." They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, "This is an act of Muḥammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them." They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:815 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When Khosrau perishes, there will be no (more) Khosrau after him, and when Caesar perishes, there will be no more Caesar after him. By Him in Whose Hands Muḥammad's life is, you will spend the treasures of both of them in Alláh's Cause."

Narrated by Jabir bin Samura {#4:816 .italic}

Musailama-al-Kadhdhab (i.e. the liar) came in the life-time of Alláh's Apostle with many of his people (to Medina) and said, "If Muḥammad makes me his successor, I will follow him." Alláh's Apostle went up to him with Thabit bin Qais bin Shams; and Alláh's Apostle was carrying a piece of a date-palm leaf in his hand. He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, "If you asked me even this piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined to, by Alláh. If you reject Islam, Alláh will destroy you. I think that you are most probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream." Abu Huraira told me that Alláh's Apostle; said, "While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#4:818 .italic}

The Prophet said, "In a dream I saw myself migrating from Mecca to a place having plenty of date trees. I thought that it was Al-Yamama or Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and that was the symbol of the victory Alláh bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Alláh, that was a blessing, and they symbolized the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Alláh bestowed upon us and the reward of true belief which Alláh gave us after the day of Badr.

Once Fatima came walking and her gait resembled the gait of the Prophet . The Prophet said, "Welcome, O my daughter!" Then he made her sit on his right or on his left side, and then he told her a secret and she started weeping. I asked her, "Why are you weeping?" He again told her a secret and she started laughing. I said, "I never saw happiness so near to sadness as I saw today." I asked her what the Prophet had told her. She said, "I would never disclose the secret of Alláh's Apostle ." When the Prophet died, I asked her about it. She replied. "The Prophet said.) 'Every year Gabriel used to revise the Qur’án with me once only, but this year he has done so twice. I think this portends my death, and you will be the first of my family to follow me.' So I started weeping. Then he said. 'Don't you like to be the mistress of all the ladies of Paradise or the mistress of all the lady believers? So I laughed for that."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#4:820 .italic}

The Prophet in his fatal illness, called his daughter Fatima and told her a secret because of which she started weeping. Then he called her and told her another secret, and she started laughing. When I asked her about that, she replied, The Prophet told me that he would die in his fatal illness, and so I wept, but then he secretly told me that from amongst his family, I would be the first to join him, and so I laughed."

"We also have sons that are equal to him (but you are partial to him.)" ‘Umar said, "It is because of his knowledge." Then ‘Umar asked Ibn ‘Abbás about the interpretation of the Verse:- 'When come the Help of Alláh and the conquest (of Mecca) (110.1) Ibn ‘Abbás said. "It portended the death of Alláh's Apostle, which Alláh had informed him of." ‘Umar said, "I do not know from this Verse but what you know."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#4:822 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle in his fatal illness came out, wrapped with a sheet, and his head was wrapped with an oiled bandage. He sat on the pulpit, and praising and glorifying Alláh, he said, "Now then, people will increase but the Ansar will decrease in number, so much so that they, compared with the people, will be just like the salt in the! meals. So, if any of you should take over the authority by which he can either benefit some people or harm some others, he should accept the goodness of their good people (i.e. Ansar) and excuse the faults of their wrong-doers." That was the last gathering which the Prophet attended.

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#4:823 .italic}

Once the Prophet brought out Al-Ḥasan and took him up the pulpit along with him and said, "This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. chief) and I hope that Alláh will help him bring about reconciliation between two Muslim groups."

Sa'd bin Mu'adh came to Mecca with the intention of performing 'Umra, and stayed at the house of Umaiya bin Khalaf Abi Safwan, for Umaiya himself used to stay at Sa'd's house when he passed by Medina on his way to Sham. Umaiya said to Sad, "Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka'ba?" So, while Sad was going around the Ka'ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, "Who is that who is performing Tawaf?" Sad replied, "I am Sad." Abu Jahl said, "Are you circumambulating the Ka'ba safely although you have given refuge to Muḥammad and his companions?" Sad said, "Yes," and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, "Don't shout at Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca)." Sad then said (to Abu Jahl). 'By Alláh, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka'ba, I will spoil your trade with Sham." Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, "Don't raise your voice." and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya), "Be away from me, for I have heard Muḥammad saying that he will kill you." Umaiiya said, "Will he kill me?" Sad said, "Yes,." Umaiya said, "By Alláh! When Muḥammad says a thing, he never tells a lie." Umaiya went to his wife and said to her, "Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has said to me?" She said, "What has he said?" He said, "He claims that he has heard Muḥammad claiming that he will kill me." She said, By Alláh! Muḥammad never tells a lie." So when the infidels started to proceed for Badr (Battle) and declared war (against the Muslims), his wife said to him, "Don't you remember what your brother from Yathrib told you?" Umaiya decided not to go but Abu Jahl said to him, "You are from the nobles of the valley of Mecca), so you should accompany us for a day or two." He went with them and thus Alláh got him killed.

Alláh's Apostle said to them, "What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?" They replied, (But) we announce their crime and lash them." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said, "You are telling a lie; Torah contains the order of Rajm." They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said to him, "Lift your hand." When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written there. They said, "Muḥammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. (‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the stones."

Narrated by 'Urwa {#4:836 .italic}

That the Prophet gave him one Dinar so as to buy a sheep for him. 'Urwa bought two sheep for him with the money. Then he sold one of the sheep for one Dinar, and brought one Dinar and a sheep to the Prophet. On that, the Prophet invoked Alláh to bless him in his deals. So 'Urwa used to gain (from any deal) even if he bought dust. (In another narration) 'Urwa said, "I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "There is always goodness in horses till the Day of Resurrection."

The Prophet said, "There is always goodness in horses.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#4:839 .italic}

The Prophet said, "A horse may be kept for one of three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad in Alláh's Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it, that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining money), and does not forget the rights of Alláh (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others to use it for Alláh's Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the Muslims." The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied, "Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse (which covers everything) :--'Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment)." (99.7-8)

I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have never forgotten a single Ḥadít_h.

Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from 'Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to 'Azib, "Tell Al-Bara' to carry the saddle for me." 'Azib said, "No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Alláh 's Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you." Abu Bakr said, "We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, 'Lie down, O Alláh's Apostle.' So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, 'To whom do you belong, O boy?' He said, 'I belong to a man from Quraish.' He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, 'Is there any milk with your sheep?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Will you then milk (some) for us?' He said, 'Yes.' Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Alláh's Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, 'Drink, O Alláh's Apostle.' So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, 'It is time for us to move, O Alláhs Apostle!' He said, 'Yes.' So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, 'These are our pursuers who have found us. O Alláh's Apostle!' He said, 'Do not grieve, for Alláh is with us."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#5:6 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle addressed the people saying, "Alláh has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Alláh." Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Alláh) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Alláh's Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Alláh's Apostle added, "The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr."

While I was sitting with the Prophet, Abu Bakr came, lifting up one corner of h is garment uncovering h is knee. The Prophet said, "Your companion has had a quarrel." Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet ) and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you." The Prophet said thrice, "O Abu Bakr! May Alláh forgive you." In the meanwhile, ‘Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr's excuse) and went to Abu Bakr's house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (‘Umar), so he knelt and said twice, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh! I was more unjust to him (than he to me)." The Prophet said, "Alláh sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), 'You are telling a lie,' while Abu Bakr said, 'He has said the truth,' and consoled me with himself and his money." He then said twice, "Won't you then give up harming my companion?" After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.

And while a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, 'I have not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing." The people said, "Glorified be Alláh." The Prophet said, "But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end ‘Umar."

Then Ibn Abi Quhafa (i.e. Abu Bakr) took the bucket from me and brought out one or two buckets (of water) and there was weakness in his drawing the water. May Alláh forgive his weakness for him. Then the bucket turned into a very big one and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:18 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Anybody who spends a pair of something in Alláh's Cause will be called from all the gates of Paradise, "O Alláh's slave! This is good.' He who is amongst those who pray will be called from the gate of the prayer (in Paradise) and he who is from the people of Jihad will be called from the gate of Jihad, and he who is from those' who give in charity (i.e. Zakat) will be called from the gate of charity, and he who is amongst those who observe fast will be called from the gate of fasting, the gate of Raiyan."

He said, "Yes, and I hope you will be among those, O Abu Bakr."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:19 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) Alláh's Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a place called As-Sunah (Al-'Aliya) ‘Umar stood up and said, "By Alláh! Alláh's Apostle is not dead!" ‘Umar (later on) said, "By Alláh! Nothing occurred to my mind except that." He said, "Verily! Alláh will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men." Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Alláh's Apostle, kissed him and said, "Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Alláh's Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Alláh in Whose Hands my life is, Alláh will never make you taste death twice." Then he went out and said, "O oath-taker! Don't be hasty." When Abu Bakr spoke, ‘Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Alláh and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muḥammad, then Muḥammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Alláh, then Alláh is Alive and shall never die." Then he recited Alláh's Statement.: "(O Muḥammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die." (39.30) He also recited: "Muḥammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Alláh And Alláh will give reward to those Who are grateful." (3.144) The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin 'Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). "There should be one 'Amir from us and one from you." Then Abu Bakr, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu 'baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. ‘Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. ‘Umar later on used to say, "By Alláh, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, "We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers)," Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, "No, by Alláh we won't accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you." Abu Bakr said, "No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the 'Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either ‘Umar or Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler." ‘Umar said (to Abu Bakr), "No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Alláh's Apostle." So ‘Umar took Abu Bakr's hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, "You have killed Sad bin Ubada." ‘Umar said, "Alláh has killed him." 'Aisha said (in another narration), ("When the Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) the Highest Companion (See Qur’án 4.69)' Aisha said, Alláh benefited the people by their two speeches. ‘Umar frightened the people some of whom were hypocrites whom Alláh caused to abandon Islam because of ‘Umar's speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they went out reciting: "Muḥammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed many Apostles have passed away before him..." (3.144)

We went out with Alláh's Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Alláh's Apostle stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, "Don't you see what 'Aisha has done? She has made Alláh's Apostle and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Alláh's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, "You detained Alláh Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water." He then admonished me and said what Alláh wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Alláh's Apostle was on my thigh . Alláh's Apostle kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Alláh revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. "O family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours." We urged the camel on which I was sitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it.

I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, "Today I shall stick to Alláh's Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service)." I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, "He had gone in this direction." So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, "Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet." Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, "Who is it?" He said, "Abu Bakr." I told him to wait, went in and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter." He said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise." So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, "Come in, and Alláh's Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise" Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Alláh's Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). "If Alláh wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here." Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, "Who is it?" He said, "‘Umar bin Al-Khattab." I asked him to wait, went to Alláh's Apostle, greeted him and said, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter." He said, "Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise." I went to "‘Umar and said "Come in, and Alláh's Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise." So he entered and sat beside Alláh's Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well. I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), "If Alláh wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here." Somebody came and moved the door. I asked "Who is it?" He replied, "Uthman bin Affan." I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, "Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, "Adult him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him." So I went up to him and said to him, "Come in; Alláh's Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. "Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, "I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves."

Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you. Then you were in the company of the Muslims, and you kept good relations with them, and if you leave them, you will leave them while they are pleased with you." ‘Umar said, (to Ibn "‘Abbás), "As for what you have said about the company of Alláh's Apostle and his being pleased with me, it is a favor, Alláh did to me; and as for what you have said about the company of Abu Bakr and his being pleased with me, it is a favor Alláh did to me; and concerning my impatience which you see, is because of you and your companions.

No doubt, the people are talking much about Al-Walid." 'Uthman said, "Did you receive your knowledge directly from Alláh's Apostle ?" I said, "No, but his knowledge did reach me and it reached (even) to a virgin in her seclusion."

So, don't I have rights similar to theirs?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Then what are these talks reaching me from you people? Now, concerning what you mentioned about the question of Al-Walid, Alláh willing, I shall deal with him according to what is right." Then he called ‘Alí and ordered him to flog him, and ‘Alí flogged him (i.e. Al-Walid) eighty lashes.

As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Alláh has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Alláh's Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Alláh's Apostle said to him, "You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).' As for his absence from the Ar-Riḍván pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than 'Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Alláh's Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Alláh's Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Riḍván pledge of Allegiance happened after 'Uthman had gone to Mecca. Alláh's Apostle held out his right hand saying, 'This is 'Uthman's hand.' He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, 'This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of 'Uthman.' Then Ibn ‘Umar said to the man, 'Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.'

The Prophet ascended the mountain of Uhud and Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and 'Uthman were accompanying him. The mountain gave a shake (i.e. trembled underneath them) . The Prophet said, "O Uhud ! Be calm." I think that the Prophet hit it with his foot, adding, "For upon you there are none but a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Maimun {#5:50 .italic}

I saw ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab a few days before he was stabbed in Medina. He was standing with Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman and 'Uthman bin Hunaif to whom he said, "What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. ‘Iráq) than it can bear?" They replied, "We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield." ‘Umar again said, "Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear." They said, "No, (we haven't)." ‘Umar added, "If Alláh should keep me alive I will let the widows of ‘Iráq need no men to support them after me." But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. ‘Umar) except ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás. Whenever ‘Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, "Stand in straight lines." When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak'a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, "The dog has killed or eaten me," at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, ‘Umar held the hand of 'Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer. Those who were standing by the side of ‘Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of ‘Umar and they were saying, "Subhan Alláh! Subhan Alláh! (i.e. Glorified be Alláh)." Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, ‘Umar said, "O Ibn ‘Abbás! Find out who attacked me." Ibn ‘Abbás kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. "The slave of Al Mughira." On that ‘Umar said, "The craftsman?" Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Yes." ‘Umar said, "May Alláh curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Alláh Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (‘Abbás) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina." Al-‘Abbás had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn ‘Abbás said to ‘Umar. "If you wish, we will do." He meant, "If you wish we will kill them." ‘Umar said, "You are mistaken (for you can't kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours." Then ‘Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, "Do not worry (he will be Alright soon)." Some said, "We are afraid (that he will die)." Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, "O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Alláh to you due to your company with Alláh's Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred." ‘Umar said, "I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything." When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. ‘Umar said, "Call the young man back to me." (When he came back) ‘Umar said, "O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord." ‘Umar further said, "O ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar! See how much I am in debt to others." When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. ‘Umar said, "If the property of ‘Umar's family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani 'Adi bin Ka'b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf." ‘Umar then said (to ‘Abdu’lláh), "Go to 'Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: "‘Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don't say: 'The chief of the believers,' because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: "‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr)." ‘Abdu’lláh greeted 'Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, "‘Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions." She said, "I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer ‘Umar to myself." When he returned it was said (to ‘Umar), "‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar has come." ‘Umar said, "Make me sit up." Somebody supported him against his body and ‘Umar asked (‘Abdu’lláh), "What news do you have?" He said, "O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission." ‘Umar said, "Praise be to Alláh, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet 'Aisha and say: "‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims." Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to ‘Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to ‘Umar), "O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor." ‘Umar said, "I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Alláh's Apostle had been pleased with before he died." Then ‘Umar mentioned ‘Alí, 'Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and 'Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, "‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty." ‘Umar added, "I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the ‘Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the 'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Alláh's and His Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability." So when ‘Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar greeted ('Aisha) and said, "‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission." 'Aisha said, "Bring him in." He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. When he was buried, the group (recommended by ‘Umar) held a meeting. Then 'Abdur-Rahman said, " Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you." Az-Zubair said, "I give up my right to ‘Alí." Talha said, "I give up my right to 'Uthman," Sad, 'I give up my right to 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf." 'Abdur-Rahman then said (to 'Uthman and ‘Alí), "Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Alláh and Islam will be his witnesses." So both the s_hayk_hs (i.e. 'Uthman and ‘Alí) kept silent. 'Abdur-Rahman said, "Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Alláh as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?" They said, "Yes." So 'Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. ‘Alí) and said, "You are related to Alláh's Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Alláh to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select 'Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him." Then he took the other (i.e. 'Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When 'Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, "O 'Uthman! Raise your hand." So he (i.e. 'Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. 'Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then ‘Alí gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#5:51 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Alláh will grant (the Muslim) victory." So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Alláh's Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, "Where is ‘Alí bin Abi Talib?" The people replied, "He is suffering from eye trouble, O Alláh's Apostle." He said, "Send for him and bring him to me." So when ‘Alí came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet then gave him the flag. ‘Alí said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?" The Prophet said, "Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Alláh which Islam prescribes for them, for by Alláh, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels."

Narrated by Salama {#5:52 .italic}

‘Alí happened to stay behind the Prophet and (did not join him) during the battle of Khaibar for he was having eye trouble. Then he said, "How could I remain behind Alláh's Apostle?" So ‘Alí set out following the Prophet , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Alláh helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Alláh's Apostle said, "I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Alláh and His Apostle love will take the flag," or said, "A man who loves Alláh and His Apostle; and Alláh will grant victory under his leadership." Suddenly came ‘Alí whom we did not expect. The people said, "This is ‘Alí." Alláh's Apostle gave him the flag and Alláh granted victory under his leadership.

Narrated by Abu Hazim {#5:53 .italic}

A man came to Sahl bin Sad and said, "This is so-and-so," meaning the Governor of Medina, "He is calling ‘Alí bad names near the pulpit." Sahl asked, "What is he saying?" He (i.e. the man) replied, "He calls him (i.e. ‘Alí) Abu Turab." Sahl laughed and said, "By Alláh, none but the Prophet called him by this name and no name was dearer to ‘Alí than this." So I asked Sahl to tell me more, saying, "O Abu ‘Abbás! How (was this name given to ‘Alí)?" Sahl said, "‘Alí went to Fatima and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet asked Fatima, "Where is your cousin?" She said, "In the Mosque." The Prophet went to him and found that his (i.e. ‘Alí's) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back. The Prophet started wiping the dust off his back and said twice, "Get up! O Abu Turab (i.e. O. man with the dust)."

A man came to Ibn ‘Umar and asked about 'Uthman and Ibn ‘Umar mentioned his good deeds and said to the questioner. "Perhaps these facts annoy you?" The other said, "Yes." Ibn ‘Umar said, "May Alláh stick your nose in the dust (i.e. degrade you)!' Then the man asked him about ‘Alí. Ibn ‘Umar mentioned his good deeds and said, "It is all true, and that is his house in the midst of the houses of the Prophet. Perhaps these facts have hurt you?" The questioner said, "Yes." Ibn ‘Umar said, "May Alláh stick your nose in the dust (i.e. degrade you or make you do things which you hate) ! Go away and do whatever you can against me."

Narrated by ‘Alí {#5:55 .italic}

Fatima complained of the suffering caused to her by the hand mill. Some Captives were brought to the Prophet, she came to him but did not find him at home 'Aisha was present there to whom she told (of her desire for a servant). When the Prophet came, Aisha informed him about Fatima's visit. ‘Alí added "So the Prophet came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet said, "Remain at your place". Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest. Then he said, "Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go to bed, say, 'Allahu-Akbar' thirty-four times, and 'Subhan Alláh thirty-three times, and 'Alhamdu-lillah thirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant."

Narrated by Ubaida {#5:56 .italic}

‘Alí said (to the people of ‘Iráq), "Judge as you used to judge, for I hate differences (and I do my best ) till the people unite as one group, or I die as my companions have died." And narrated Sad that the Prophet said to ‘Alí, "Will you not be pleased from this that you are to me like Aaron was to Moses?"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:57 .italic}

The people used to say, "Abu Huraira narrates too many narrations." In fact I used to keep close to Alláh's Apostle and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Qur’ánic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja'far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.

Whenever there was drought, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab used to ask Alláh for rain through Al'‘Abbás bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib, saying, "O Alláh! We used to request our Prophet to ask You for rain, and You would give us. Now we request the uncle of our Prophet to ask You for rain, so give us rain." And they would be given rain."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:60 .italic}

Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Alláh had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muḥammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. Alláh's property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.' By Alláh! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Alláh's Apostle used to do," Then ‘Alí said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, and that Muḥammad is His Apostle," and added, "O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority." Then he (i.e. ‘Alí) mentioned their own relationship to Alláh's Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, "By Alláh in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Alláh's Apostle rather than to my own relatives" Abu Bark added: Look at Muḥammad through his family (i.e. if you are no good to his family you are not good to him).

The Prophet called his daughter Fatima during his illness in which he died, and told her a secret whereupon she wept. Then he called her again and told her a secret whereupon she laughed. When I asked her about that, she replied, "The Prophet spoke to me in secret and informed me that he would die in the course of the illness during which he died, so I wept. He again spoke to me in secret and informed me that I would be the first of his family to follow him (after his death) and on that I laughed."

'Uthman bin 'Affan was afflicted with severe nose-bleeding in the year when such illness was prevelant and that prevented him from performing Hajj, and (because of it) he made his will. A man from Quraish came to him and said, "Appoint your successor." 'Uthman asked, "Did the people name him? (i.e. the successor) the man said, "Yes." Uthman asked, "Who is that?" The man remained silent. Another man came to 'Uthman and I think it was Al-Harith. He also said, "Appoint your successor." 'Uthman asked, "Did the people name him?" The man replied "Yes." 'Uthman said, "Who is that?" The man remained silent. 'Uthman said, "Perhaps they have mentioned Az-Zubair?" The man said, "Yes." 'Uthman said, "By Him in Whose Hands my life is, he is the best of them as I know, and the dearest of them to Alláh's Apostle ."

While I was with 'Uthman, a man came to him and said, "Appoint your successor." 'Uthman said, "Has such successor been named?" He replied, "Yes, Az-Zubair." 'Uthman said, thrice, "By Alláh! Indeed you know that he is the best of you."

During the battle of Al-Ahzab, I and ‘Umar bin Abi-Salama were kept behind with the women. Behold! I saw (my father) Az-Zubair riding his horse, going to and coming from Bani Quraiza twice or thrice. So when I came back I said, "O my father! I saw you going to and coming from Bani Quraiza?" He said, "Did you really see me, O my son?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Alláh's Apostle said, 'Who will go to Bani Quraiza and bring me their news?' So I went, and when I came back, Alláh's Apostle mentioned for me both his parents saying, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you."'

On the day of the battle of Al-Yarmuk, the companions of the Prophet said to Az-Zubair, "Will you attack the enemy vigorously so that we may attack them along with you?"

‘Alí demanded the hand of the daughter of Abu Jahl. Fatima heard of this and went to Alláh's Apostle saying, "Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as ‘Alí is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. "On that Alláh's Apostle got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, "Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-'As bin Al-Rabi' (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled. By Alláh, the daughter of Alláh's Apostle and the daughter of Alláh's Enemy cannot be the wives of one man." So ‘Alí gave up that engagement. 'Al-Miswar further said: I heard the Prophet talking and he mentioned a son-in-law of his belonging to the tribe of Bani 'Abd-Shams. He highly praised him concerning that relationship and said (whenever) he spoke to me, he spoke the truth, and whenever he promised me, he fulfilled his promise."

The people of the Quraish tribe were worried about the Makhzumiya woman. They said. "Nobody dare speak to him (i.e. the Prophet ) except Usama bin Zaid as he is the most beloved to Alláh's Apostle." Aisha said, "A woman from Bani Makhzumiya committed a theft and the people said, 'Who can intercede with the Prophet for her?' So nobody dared speak to him (i.e. the Prophet) but Usama bin Zaid spoke to him. The Prophet said, 'If a reputable man amongst the children of Bani Israel committed a theft, they used to forgive him, but if a poor man committed a theft, they would cut his hand. But I would cut even the hand of Fatima (i.e. the daughter of the Prophet) if she committed a theft."

Somebody then said (to Ibn ‘Umar), "Don't you know him, O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman? He is Muḥammad bin Usama."

Harmala, the freed slave of Usama bin Zaid said that while he was in the company of ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar, Al-Hajjaj bin Aiman came in and (while praying) he did not perform his bowing and prostrations properly. So Ibn ‘Umar told him to repeat his prayer. When he went away, Ibn ‘Umar asked me, "Who is he?" I said, "Al-Hajjaj bin Um Aiman." Ibn ‘Umar said, "If Alláh's Apostle saw him, he would have loved him." Then Ibn ‘Umar mentioned the love of the Prophet for the children of Um Aimn.

If a man saw a dream during the lifetime of the Prophet he would narrate it to the Prophet. Once I wished to see a dream and narrate it to the Prophet I was young, unmarried, and used to sleep in the Mosque during the lifetime of the Prophet. I dreamt that two angels took me and went away with me towards the (Hell) Fire which looked like a well with the inside walls built up, and had two side-walls like those of a well. There I saw some people in it whom I knew. I started saying, "I seek Refuge with Alláh from the (Hell) Fire, I seek Refuge with Alláh from the (Hell) Fire." Then another angel met the other two and said to me, "Do not be afraid." I narrated my dream to Hafsa who, in her turn, narrated it to the Prophet. He said, "What an excellent man ‘Abdu’lláh is if he only observes the night prayer." (Salem, a sub-narrator said, "‘Abdu’lláh used not to sleep at night but very little hence forward."

I asked, "Who is he?" They replied, "(He is) Abu-Ad-Darda.' I said (to him), "I prayed to Alláh to bless me with a pious companion and He sent you to me." He asked me, "From where are you?"

The Prophet asked, "What is this (scent)?" He replied, "I got married." The Prophet asked, "How much Mahr did you give her?"

I have never heard the Prophet saying about anybody walking on the earth that he is from the people of Paradise except ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam. The following Verse was revealed concerning him: "And a witness from the children of Israel testifies that this Qur’án is true" (46.10)

Narrated by Qais bin Ubad {#5:158 .italic}

While I was sitting in the Mosque of Medina, there entered a man (‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam) with signs of solemnity over his face. The people said, "He is one of the people of Paradise." He prayed two light Rakat and then left. I followed him and said, "When you entered the Mosque, the people said, 'He is one of the people of Paradise.' " He said, "By Alláh, one ought not say what he does not know; and I will tell you why. In the lifetime of the Prophet I had a dream which I narrated to him. I saw as if I were in a garden." He then described its extension and greenery. He added: In its center there was an iron pillar whose lower end was fixed in the earth and the upper end was in the sky, and at its upper end there was a (ring-shaped) hand-hold. I was told to climb it. I said, "I can't." "Then a servant came to me and lifted my clothes from behind and I climbed till I reached the top (of the pillar). Then I got hold of the hand-hold, and I was told to hold it tightly, then I woke up and (the effect of) the hand-hold was in my hand. I narrated al I that to the Prophet who said, 'The garden is Islam, and the hand-hold is the Most Truth-worthy Hand-Hold. So you will remain as a Muslim till you die." The narrator added: "The man was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam."

Narrated by Abu Burda {#5:159 .italic}

When I came to Medina. I met ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam. He said, "Will you come to me so that I may serve you with Sawiq (i.e. powdered barley) and dates, and let you enter a (blessed) house that in which the Prophet entered?" Then he added, "You are In a country where the practice of Riba (i.e. usury) is prevalent; so if somebody owe you something and he sends you a present of a load of chopped straw or a load of barley or a load of provender then do not take it, as it is Riba."

Narrated by Jarir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:160 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle has never refused to admit me since I embraced Islam, and whenever he saw me, he would smile. (In another narration) Jarir bin ‘Abdu’lláh narrated: There was a house called Dhul-Khalasa in the Pre-lslamic Period and it was also called Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. Alláh's Apostle said to me, "Will you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?" So I left for it with 150 cavalrymen from the tribe of Ahmas and then we destroyed it and killed whoever we found there. Then we came to the Prophet and informed him about it. He invoked good upon us and upon the tribe of Ahmas.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:161 .italic}

On the day of the battle of Uhud the pagans were defeated completely. Then Satan shouted loudly, "O Alláh's slaves! Beware the ones behind you!" So the front files attacked the back ones. Then Hudhaifa looked and saw his father, and said loudly, "O Alláh's slaves! My father! My father!" By Alláh, they did not stop till they killed him (i.e. Hudaifa's father). Hudhaifa said, "May Alláh forgive you!" The sub-narrator said, "By Alláh, because of what Hudhaifa said, he remained in a good state till he met Alláh (i.e. died)."

Narrated by ‘Alí {#5:162 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying (as below).

Narrated by ‘Alí {#5:163 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The best of the world's women is Mary (at her lifetime), and the best of the world's women is Khadija (at her lifetime)."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:164 .italic}

I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija (although) she died before he married me, for I often heard him mentioning her, and Alláh had told him to give her the good tidings that she would have a palace of Qasab (i.e. pipes of precious stones and pearls in Paradise), and whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would send her women-friends a good share of it.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:165 .italic}

I did not feel jealous of any woman as much as I did of Khadija because Alláh's Apostle used to mention her very often. He married me after three years of her death, and his Lord (or Gabriel) ordered him to give her the good news of having a palace of Qasab in Paradise.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:166 .italic}

I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija though I did not see her, but the Prophet used to mention her very often, and when ever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut its parts and send them to the women friends of Khadija. When I sometimes said to him, "(You treat Khadija in such a way) as if there is no woman on earth except Khadija," he would say, "Khadija was such-and-such, and from her I had children."

Narrated by Ismá’íl {#5:167 .italic}

I asked ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Aufa, "Did the Prophet give glad tidings to Khadija?" He said, "Yes, of a palace of Qasab (in Paradise) where there will be neither any noise nor any fatigue."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:168 .italic}

Gabriel came to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This is Khadija coming to you with a dish having meat soup (or some food or drink). When she reaches you, greet her on behalf of her Lord (i.e. Alláh) and on my behalf, and give her the glad tidings of having a Qasab palace in Paradise wherein there will be neither any noise nor any fatigue (trouble) . " Narrated 'Aisha: Once Hala bint Khuwailid, Khadija's sister, asked the permission of the Prophet to enter. On that, the Prophet remembered the way Khadija used to ask permission, and that upset him. He said, "O Alláh! Hala!" So I became jealous and said, "What makes you remember an old woman amongst the old women of Quraish an old woman (with a teethless mouth) of red gums who died long ago, and in whose place Alláh has given you somebody better than her?"

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#5:169 .italic}

The Prophet met Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of (the valley of) Baldah before any Divine Inspiration came to the Prophet. A meal was presented to the Prophet but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid) who said, "I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat none but those things on which Alláh's Name has been mentioned at the time of slaughtering." Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter their animals, and used to say, "Alláh has created the sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in other than the Name of Alláh. He used to say so, for he rejected that practice and considered it as something abominable. Narrated Ibn ‘Umar: Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail went to Sham, inquiring about a true religion to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He said, "I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me some thing about it." The Jew said, "You will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Alláh's Anger." Zaid said, "'I do not run except from Alláh's Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you tell me of some other religion?" He said, "I do not know any other religion except the Hanif." Zaid enquired, "What is Hanif?" He said, "Hanif is the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to worship None but Alláh (Alone)" Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious scholar and told him the same as before. The Christian said, "You will not embrace our religion unless you get a share of Alláh's Curse." Zaid replied, "I do not run except from Alláh's Curse, and I will never bear any of Alláh's Curse and His Anger if I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?" He replied, "I do not know any other religion except Hanif." Zaid enquired, "What is Hanif?" He replied, Hanif is the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian and he used to worship None but Alláh (Alone)" When Zaid heard their Statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out, he raised both his hands and said, "O Alláh! I make You my Witness that I am on the religion of Abraham." Narrated Asmá’ bint Abi Bakr: I saw Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail standing with his back against the Ka'ba and saying, "O people of Quraish! By Alláh, none amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me." He used to preserve the lives of little girls: If somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him, "Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf." So he would take her, and when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, "Now if you want her, I will give her to you, and if you wish, I will feed her on your behalf."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:170 .italic}

When the Ka'ba was rebuilt, the Prophet and ‘Abbás went to carry stones. ‘Abbás said to the Prophet "(Take off and) put your waist sheet over your neck so that the stones may not hurt you." (But as soon as he took off his waist sheet) he fell unconscious on the ground with both his eyes towards the sky. When he came to his senses, he said, "My waist sheet! My waist sheet!" Then he tied his waist sheet (round his waist).

Narrated by 'Amr bin Dinar and 'Ubaidullah bin Abi Yazíd {#5:171 .italic}

In the lifetime of the Prophet there was no wall around the Ka'ba and the people used to pray around the Ka'ba till ‘Umar became the Caliph and he built the wall around it. 'Ubaidullah further said, "Its wall was low, so Ibn Az-Zubair built it."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:172 .italic}

'Ashura' (i.e. the tenth of Muharram) was a day on which the tribe of Quraish used to fast in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance. The Prophet also used to fast on this day. So when he migrated to Medina, he fasted on it and ordered (the Muslims) to fast on it. When the fasting of Ramaḍán was enjoined, it became optional for the people to fast or not to fast on the day of Ashura.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#5:173 .italic}

The people used to consider the performance of 'Umra in the months of Hajj an evil deed on the earth, and they used to call the month of Muharram as Safar and used to say, "When (the wounds over) the backs (of the camels) have healed and the foot-marks (of the camels) have vanished (after coming from Hajj), then 'Umra becomes legal for the one who wants to perform 'Umra." Alláh's Apostle and his companions reached Mecca assuming Ihram for Hajj on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The Prophet ordered his companions to perform 'Umra (with that lhram instead of Hajj). They asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What kind of finishing of Ihram?" The Prophet said, "Finish the Ihram completely.'

In the pre-lslamic period of ignorance a flood of rain came and filled the valley in between the two mountains (around the Ka'ba).

Narrated by Qais bin Abi Hazim {#5:175 .italic}

Abu Bakr went to a lady from the Ahmas tribe called Zainab bint Al-Muḥájir and found that she refused to speak. He asked, "Why does she not speak." The people said, "She has intended to perform Hajj without speaking." He said to her, "Speak, for it is illegal not to speak, as it is an action of the pre-islamic period of ignorance. So she spoke and said, "Who are you?" He said, "A man from the Emigrants." She asked, "Which Emigrants?" He replied, "From Quraish." She asked, "From what branch of Quraish are you?" He said, "You ask too many questions; I am Abu Bakr." She said, "How long shall we enjoy this good order (i.e. Islamic religion) which Alláh has brought after the period of ignorance?" He said, "You will enjoy it as long as your Imams keep on abiding by its rules and regulations." She asked, "What are the Imams?" He said, "Were there not heads and chiefs of your nation who used to order the people and they used to obey them?" She said, "Yes." He said, "So they (i.e. the Imams) are those whom I meant."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:176 .italic}

A black lady slave of some of the 'Arabs embraced Islam and she had a hut in the mosque. She used to visit us and talk to us, and when she finished her talk, she used to say: "The day of the scarf was one of our Lord's wonders: Verily! He has delivered me from the land of Kufr." When she said the above verse many times, I (i.e. 'Aisha) asked her, "What was the day of the scarf?" She replied, "Once the daughter of some of my masters went out and she was wearing a leather scarf (round her neck) and the leather scarf fell from her and a kite descended and picked it up, mistaking it for a piece of meat. They (i.e. my masters) accused me of stealing it and they tortured me to such an extent that they even looked for it in my private parts. So, while they all were around me, and I was in my great distress, suddenly the kite came over our heads and threw the scarf, and they took it. I said to them 'This is what you accused me of stealing, though I was innocent."

Narrated by ‘Umar {#5:177 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If anybody has to take an oath, he should swear only by Alláh." The people of Quraish used to swear by their fathers, but the Prophet said, "Do not swear by your fathers. "

Al-Qasim used to walk in front of the funeral procession. He used not to get up for the funeral procession (in case it passed by him). And he narrated from 'Aisha that she said, "The people of the pre-lslamic period of ignorance used to stand up for the funeral procession. When they saw it they used to say twice: 'You were noble in your family. What are you now?"

Abu Bakr had a slave who used to give him some of his earnings. Abu Bakr used to eat from it. One day he brought something and Abu Bakr ate from it. The slave said to him, "Do you know what this is?" Abu Bakr then enquired, "What is it?" The slave said, "Once, in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance I foretold somebody's future though I did not know this knowledge of foretelling but I, cheated him, and when he met me, he gave me something for that service, and that is what you have eaten from." Then Abu Bakr put his hand in his mouth and vomited whatever was present in his stomach.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:183 .italic}

In the pre-lslamic period of ignorance the people used to bargain with the meat of camels on the principle of Habal-al-Habala which meant the sale of a she-camel that would be born by a she-camel that had not yet been born. The Prophet forbade them such a transaction.

Narrated by Ghailan bin Jarir {#5:184 .italic}

We used to visit Anas bin Malik and he used to talk to us about the Ansar, and used to say to me: "Your people did so-and-so on such-and-such a day, and your people did so-and-so on such-and-such a day."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#5:185 .italic}

The first event of Qasama in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance was practiced by us (i.e. Banu Hashim). A man from Banu Hashim was employed by a Quraishi man from another branch-family. The (Hashimi) laborer set out with the Quraishi driving his camels. There passed by him another man from Banu Hashim. The leather rope of the latter's bag had broken so he said to the laborer, "Will you help me by giving me a rope in order to tie the handle of my bag lest the camels should run away from me?" The laborer gave him a rope and the latter tied his bag with it. When the caravan halted, all the camels' legs were tied with their fetters except one camel. The employer asked the laborer, "Why, from among all the camels has this camel not been fettered?" He replied, "There is no fetter for it." The Quraishi asked, "Where is its fetter?" and hit the laborer with a stick that caused his death (later on Just before his death) a man from Yemen passed by him. The laborer asked (him), "Will you go for the pilgrimage?" He replied, "I do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I will attend it." The (Hashimi) laborer said, "Will you please convey a message for me once in your life?" The other man said, "yes." The laborer wrote: 'When you attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond to you, call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, ask about Abu Talib and tell him that so-and-so has killed me for a fetter." Then the laborer expired. When the employer reached (Mecca), Abu Talib visited him and asked, "What has happened to our companion?" He said, "He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died) and I buried him." Then Abu Talib said, "The deceased deserved this from you." After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked to convey the message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He called, "O the family of Quraish!" The people replied, "This is Quraish." Then he called, "O the family of Banu Hashim!" Again the people replied, "This is Banu Hashim." He asked, "Who is Abu Talib?" The people replied, "This is Abu Talib." He said, "'So-and-so has asked me to convey a message to you that so-and-so has killed him for a fetter (of a camel)." Then Abu Talib went to the (Quraishi) killer and said to him, "Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you wish, give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, (ii) or if you wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you have not murdered our companion, and if you do not accept this, (iii) we will kill you in Qisas." The killer went to his people and they said, "We will take an oath." Then a woman from Banu Hashim who was married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a child from him, came to Abu Talib and said, "O Abu Talib! I wish that my son from among the fifty men, should be excused from this oath, and that he should not take the oath where the oath-taking is carried on." Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came (to Abu Talib) and said, "O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two camels (in case he does not take an oath). So there are two camels I would like you to accept from me and excuse me from taking an oath where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him. Then 48 men came and took the oath. Ibn ‘Abbás further said:) By Him in Whose Hand my life is, before the end of that year, none of those 48 persons remained alive.

Alláh caused the day of Buath to take place before Alláh's Apostle was sent (as an Apostle) so that when Alláh's Apostle reached Medina, those people had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded. So Alláh made that day precede Alláh's Apostle so that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace Islam. Narrated Ibn ‘Abbás: To run along the valley between two green pillars of Safa and Marwa (mountains) was not Sunna, but the people in the pre-islamic period of ignorance used to run along it, and used to say: "We do not cross this rain stream except running strongly. "

Narrated by Abu As-Safar {#5:187 .italic}

I heard Ibn ‘Abbás saying, "O people! Listen to what I say to you, and let me hear whatever you say, and don't go (without understanding), and start saying, 'Ibn ‘Abbás said so-and-so, Ibn ‘Abbás said so-and-so, Ibn ‘Abbás said so-and-so.' He who wants to perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba should go behind Al-Hijr (i.e. a portion of the Ka'ba left out unroofed) and do not call it Al-Hatim, for in the pre-Islamic period of ignorance if any man took an oath, he used to throw his whip, shoes or bow in it.

Narrated by 'Amr bin Maimun {#5:188 .italic}

During the pre-lslamic period of ignorance I saw a she-monkey surrounded by a number of monkeys. They were all stoning it, because it had committed illegal sexual intercourse. I too, stoned it along with them.

'Ubaidullah said: "I heard Ibn ‘Abbás saying, "Following are some traits of the people of the pre-Islamic period of ignorance (i) to defame the ancestry of other families, (ii) and to wail over the dead." 'Ubaidullah forgot the third trait. Sufyan said, "They say it (i.e. the third trait) was to believe that rain was caused by the influence of stars (i.e. if a special star appears it will rain)."

I came to the Prophet while he was leaning against his sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka'ba. We were suffering greatly from the pagans in those days. i said (to him). "Will you invoke Alláh (to help us)?" He sat down with a red face and said, "(A believer among) those who were before you used to be combed with iron combs so that nothing of his flesh or nerves would remain on his bones; yet that would never make him desert his religion. A saw might be put over the parting of his head which would be split into two parts, yet all that would never make him abandon his religion. Alláh will surely complete this religion (i.e. Islam) so that a traveler from Sana to Hadra-maut will not be afraid of anybody except Alláh." (The sub-narrator, Baiyan added, "Or the wolf, lest it should harm his sheep.")

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:192 .italic}

The Prophet recited Surat An-Najam and prostrated, and there was nobody who did not prostrate then except a man whom I saw taking a handful of pebbles, lifting it, and prostrating on it. He then said, "This is sufficient for me." No doubt I saw him killed as a disbeliever afterwards.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:193 .italic}

While the Prophet was prostrating, surrounded by some of Quraish, 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait brought the intestines (i.e. abdominal contents) of a camel and put them over the back of the Prophet. The Prophet did not raise his head, (till) Fatima, came and took it off his back and cursed the one who had done the harm. The Prophet said, "O Alláh! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, 'Utba bin Rabi'al, Shaba bin Rabi'a, Umaiya bin Khalaf or Ubai bin Khalaf." (The sub-narrator Shu'ba, is not sure of the last name.) I saw these people killed on the day of Badr battle and thrown in the well except Umaiya or Ubai whose body parts were mutilated but he was not thrown in the well.

'AbdurRahman bin Abza said, "Ask Ibn ‘Abbás about these two Qur’ánic Verses: 'Nor kill such life as Alláh has made sacred, Except for just cause.' (25.168) "And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell. (4.93) So I asked Ibn ‘Abbás who said, "When the Verse that is in Sura-al-Furqan was revealed, the pagans of Mecca said, 'But we have slain such life as Alláh has made sacred, and we have invoked other gods along with Alláh, and we have also committed fornication.' So Alláh revealed:-- 'Except those who repent, believe, and do good-- (25.70) So this Verse was concerned with those people. As for the Verse in Surat-an-Nisa (4-93), it means that if a man, after understanding Islam and its laws and obligations, murders somebody, then his punishment is to dwell in the (Hell) Fire forever." Then I mentioned this to Mujahid who said, "Except the one who regrets (one's crime) . "

That once he was in the, company of the Prophet carrying a water pot for his ablution and for cleaning his private parts. While he was following him carrying it(i.e. the pot), the Prophet said, "Who is this?" He said, "I am Abu Huraira." The Prophet said, "Bring me stones in order to clean my private parts, and do not bring any bones or animal dung." Abu Huraira went on narrating: So I brought some stones, carrying them in the corner of my robe till I put them by his side and went away. When he finished, I walked with him and asked, "What about the bone and the animal dung?" He said, "They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me--and how nice those Jinns were--and asked me for the remains of the human food. I invoked Alláh for them that they would never pass by a bone or animal dung but find food on them."

When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the Prophet he said to his brother, "Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven. Listen to what he says and come back to me." So his brother set out and came to the Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him. "I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not poetry." Abu Dhar said, "You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted." He then took his journey-food and carried a water-skin of his, containing some water till be reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away, ‘Alí saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw ‘Alí, he followed him, and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his retiring place. ‘Alí passed by him and said, "Has the man not known his dwelling place yet?" So ‘Alí awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the other about anything. When it was the third day. ‘Alí did the same and Abu Dhar stayed with him. Then ‘Alí said "Will you tell me what has brought you here?" Abu Dhar said, "If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell you." ‘Alí promised him, and he informed ‘Alí about the matter. ‘Alí said, "It is true, and he is the Apostle of Alláh. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me and enter the place which I will enter." Abu Dhar did so, and followed ‘Alí till he entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some of the Prophet's talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, "Go back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order." Abu Dhar said, "By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst them (i.e. the pagans)." So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as loudly as possible, "I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, and Muḥammad is the Apostle of Alláh." The People got up and beat him painfully. Then Al-‘Abbás came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the people), "Woe to you! Don't you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and your trade to Sha'm is through their way?" So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again Al-‘Abbás knelt over him (to protect him).

I heard Said bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail saying in the mosque of Al-Kufa. "By Alláh, I have seen myself tied and forced by ‘Umar to leave Islam before ‘Umar himself embraced Islam. And if the mountain of Uhud could move from its place for the evil which you people have done to 'Uthman, then it would have the right to move from its place."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Mus'ud {#5:203 .italic}

We have been powerful since ‘Umar embraced Islam.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#5:204 .italic}

While ‘Umar was at home in a state of fear, there came Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi Abu 'Amr, wearing an embroidered cloak and a shirt having silk hems. He was from the tribe of Bani Sahm who were our allies during the pre-Islamic period of ignorance. Al-'As said to ‘Umar "What is wrong with you?" He said, "Your people claim that they would kill me if I become a Muslim." Al-'As said, "Nobody will harm you after I have given protection to you." So Al-'As went out and met the people streaming in the whole valley. He said, "Where are you going?" They said, "We want Ibn Al-Khattab who has embraced Islam." Al-'As said, "There is no way for anybody to touch him." So the people retreated.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#5:205 .italic}

When ‘Umar embraced Islam, all The (disbelieving) people gathered around his home and said, "‘Umar has embraced Islam." At that time I was still a boy and was on the roof of my house. There came a man wearing a cloak of Dibaj (i.e. a kind of silk), and said, "‘Umar has embraced Islam. Nobody can harm him for I am his protector." I then saw the people going away from ‘Umar and asked who the man was, and they said, "Al-'As bin Wail."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#5:206 .italic}

I never heard ‘Umar saying about something that he thought it would be so-and-so, but he was quite right. Once, while ‘Umar was sitting, a handsome man passed by him, ‘Umar said, "If I am not wrong, this person is still on his religion of the pre-lslamic period of ignorance or he was their foreteller. Call the man to me." When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought. The man said, "I have never seen such a day on which a Muslim is faced with such an accusation." ‘Umar said, "I am determined that you should tell me the truth." He said, "I was a foreteller in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance." Then ‘Umar said, "Tell me the most astonishing thing your female Jinn has told you of." He said, "One-day while I was in the market, she came to me scared and said, 'Haven't you seen the Jinns and their despair and they were overthrown after their defeat (and prevented from listening to the news of the heaven) so that they (stopped going to the sky and) kept following camel-riders (i.e. 'Arabs)?" ‘Umar said, "He is right." and added, "One day while I was near their idols, there came a man with a calf and slaughtered it as a sacrifice (for the idols). An (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was crying, 'O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except you (O Alláh).' On that the people fled, but I said, 'I shall not go away till I know what is behind this.' Then the cry came again: 'O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh.' I then went away and a few days later it was said, "A prophet has appeared."

I heard Said bin Zaid saying to the people, "If you but saw me and ‘Umar's sister tied and forced by ‘Umar to leave Islam while he was not yet a Muslim. And if the mountain of Uhud could move from its place for the evil which you people have done to Uthman, it would have the right to do that."

Narrated by 'Ubaidullah bin 'Adi bin Al-Khiyar {#5:212 .italic}

That Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin 'Abu Yaghuth had said to him, "What prevents you from speaking to your uncle 'Uthman regarding his brother Al-Walid bin 'Uqba?" The people were speaking against the latter for what he had done. 'Ubaidullah said, "So I kept waiting for 'Uthman, and when he went out for the prayer, I said to him, 'I have got something to say to you as a piece of advice.' 'Uthman said, 'O man! I seek Refuge with Alláh from you. So I went away. When I finished my prayer, I sat with Al-Miswar and Ibn 'Abu Yaghuth and talked to both of them of what I had said to 'Uthman and what he had said to me. They said, 'You have done your duty.' So while I was sitting with them. 'Uthman's Messenger came to me. They said, 'Alláh has put you to trial." I set out and when I reached 'Uthman, he said, 'What is your advice which you mentioned a while ago?' I recited Tashahhud and added, 'Alláh has sent Muḥammad and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Qur’án) to him. You (O Uthman!) were amongst those who responded to the call of Alláh and His Apostle and had faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina), and you enjoyed the company of Alláh's Apostle and learned his traditions and advice. Now the people are talking much about Al-Walid bin 'Uqba and so it is your duty to impose on him the legal punishment.' 'Uthman then said to me, 'O my nephew! Did you ever meet Alláh's Apostle ?' I said, 'No, but his knowledge has reached me as it has reached the virgin in her seclusion.' 'Uthman then recited Tashahhud and said, 'No doubt, Alláh has sent Muḥammad with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Qur’án) and I was amongst those who responded to the call of Alláh and His Apostle and I had faith in Muḥammad's Mission, and I had performed the first two migrations as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Alláh's Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Alláh, I never disobeyed him and never cheated him till Alláh caused him to die. Then Alláh made Abu Bakr Caliph, and by Alláh, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then ‘Umar became Caliph, and by Alláh, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then I became Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?' I replied in the affirmative. 'Uthman further said, 'The what are these talks which are reaching me from you? As for what you ha mentioned about Al-Walid bin 'Uqb; Alláh willing, I shall give him the leg; punishment justly. Then Uthman ordered that Al-Walid be flogged fort lashes. He ordered ‘Alí to flog him an he himself flogged him as well."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:213 .italic}

Um Habiba and Um Salama mentioned a church they had seen in Ethiopia and in the church there were pictures. When they told the Prophet of this, he said, "Those people are such that if a pious man amongst them died, they build a place of worship over his grave and paint these pictures in it. Those people will be Alláh's worst creatures on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by Um Khalid bint Khalid {#5:214 .italic}

When I came from Ethiopia (to Medina), I was a young girl. Alláh's Apostle made me wear a sheet having marks on it. Alláh's Apostle was rubbing those marks with his hands saying, "Sanah! Sanah!" (i.e. good, good).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:215 .italic}

We used to greet the Prophet while he used to be in prayers, and he used to reply to our greetings. But when we came back from Najashi (the King of Ethiopia) we greeted him (while he was praying) and he did not reply to us. We said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We used to greet you in the past and you used to reply to us." He said, "Verily The Mind is occupied and busy with more important matter during the prayer." (So one cannot return One's greetings.)

Narrated by Abu Musa {#5:216 .italic}

We received the news of the departure of the Prophet (to Medina) while we were in Yemen. So we went on board a ship but our ship took us away to An-Najashi (the Negus) in Ethiopia. There we met Ja'far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him till we came (to Medina) by the time when the Prophet had conquered Khaibar. The Prophet said, "O you people of the ship! You will have (the reward of) two migrations."

Narrated by Jabir {#5:217 .italic}

That he said to the Prophet "You have not been of any avail to your uncle (Abu Talib) (though) by Alláh, he used to protect you and used to become angry on your behalf." The Prophet said, "He is in a shallow fire, and had It not been for me, he would have been in the bottom of the (Hell) Fire."

Narrated by Al-Musaiyab {#5:223 .italic}

When Abu Talib was in his death bed, the Prophet went to him while Abu Jahl was sitting beside him. The Prophet said, "O my uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, an expression I will defend your case with, before Alláh." Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Umaya said, "O Abu Talib! Will you leave the religion of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib?" So they kept on saying this to him so that the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: "I am on the religion of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib." Then the Prophet said, " I will keep on asking for Alláh's Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so." Then the following Verse was revealed: "It is not fitting for the Prophet and the believers to ask Alláh's Forgiveness for the pagans, even if they were their near relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire." (9.113) The other Verse was also revealed:-- "(O Prophet!) Verily, you guide not whom you like, but Alláh guides whom He will ..." (28.56)

Narrated by ‘Abbás bin Malik {#5:227 .italic}

Malik bin Sasaa said that Alláh's Apostle described to them his Night Journey saying, "While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here." I asked Al-Jarud who was by my side, "What does he mean?" He said, "It means from his throat to his pubic area," or said, "From the top of the chest." The Prophet further said, "He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me." (On this Al-Jarud asked, "Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?" I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, "The animal's step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal's sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven. When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has Muḥammad been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). 'This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened. When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yaḥyá (i.e. John) and 'Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), 'These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.' So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!' The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is Idris; pay him your greetings.' So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked. 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.' I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),' This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.' When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, 'What makes you weep?' Moses said, 'I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked,' Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, 'Muḥammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your father; pay your greetings to him.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, 'What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?' He replied,' As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, 'This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.' Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), 'What have you been ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.' Moses said, 'Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Alláh, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers' burden.' So I went back, and Alláh reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Alláh and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Alláh and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Alláh and was ordered to observe five prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.' He said, 'Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower's burden.' I said, 'I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Alláh's Order.' When I left, I heard a voice saying, 'I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers."

Regarding the Statement of Alláh" "And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens) which We made you see (as an actual eye witness) was only made as a trial for the people." (17.60) Ibn ‘Abbás added: The sights which Alláh's Apostle was shown on the Night Journey when he was taken to Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) were actual sights, (not dreams). And the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur’án is the tree of Zaqqúm (itself) .

Who was Kab's guide when Ka'b turned blind: I heard Ka'b bin Malik narrating: When he remained behind (i.e. did not Join) the Prophet in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. Ibn Bukair, in his narration stated that Ka'b said, " I witnessed the Al-'Áqába pledge of allegiance at night with the Prophet when we jointly agreed to support Islam with all our efforts I would not like to have attended the Badr battle instead of that 'Áqába pledge although Badr is more well-known than it, amongst the people."

Who had taken part in the battle of Badr with Alláh's Apostle and had been amongst his companions on the night of Al-'Áqába Pledge: Alláh's Apostle, surrounded by a group of his companions said, "Come along and give me the pledge of allegiance that you will not worship anything besides Alláh, will not steal, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse will not kill your children, will not utter; slander, invented by yourself, and will not disobey me if I order you to do something good. Whoever among you will respect and fulfill this pledge, will be rewarded by Alláh. And if one of you commits any of these sins and is punished in this world then that will be his expiation for it, and if one of you commits any of these sins and Alláh screens his sin, then his matter, will rest with Alláh: If He will, He will punish him and if He will,. He will excuse him." So I gave the pledge of allegiance to him for these conditions.

Narrated by 'Ubada bin As Samit {#5:233 .italic}

I was one of the Naqibs who gave the ('Áqába) Pledge of Allegiance to Alláh's Apostle . We gave the pledge of allegiance to him that we would not worship anything other than Alláh, would not steal, would not commit illegal sexual intercourse, would not kill a person whose killing Alláh has made illegal except rightfully, would not rob each other, and we would not be promised Paradise jf we did the above sins, then if we committed one of the above sins, Alláh will give His Judgment concerning it.

Narrated by Aisha {#5:234 .italic}

The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, "Best wishes and Alláh's Blessing and a good luck." Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Alláh's Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age.

Narrated by Abu Wail {#5:237 .italic}

We visited Khabbaba who said, "We migrated with the Prophet for Alláh's Sake, so our reward became due and sure with Alláh. Some of us passed away without taking anything of their rewards (in this world) and one of them was Mus'ab bin ‘Umar who was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Uhud leaving a striped woolen cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and when covered his feet, his head became naked. So Alláh's Apostle ordered us to cover his head and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a special kind of grass) on his feet. (On the other hand) some of us have had their fruits ripened (in this world) and they are collecting them."

Narrated by ‘Umar {#5:238 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "The reward of deeds depends on the intentions, so whoever emigrated for the worldly benefits or to marry a woman, his emigration was for that for which he emigrated, but whoever emigrated for the Sake of Alláh and His Apostle, his emigration is for Alláh and His Apostle."

Narrated by Mujahid bin Jabir Al-Makki {#5:239 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar used to say, "There is no more Hijrah (i.e. migration) after the Conquest of Mecca."

Narrated by 'Ata bin Abi Rabah {#5:240 .italic}

'Ubaid bin ‘Umar Al-Laithi and I visited Aisha and asked her about the Hijra (i.e. migration), and she said, "Today there is no (Hijrah) emigration. A believer used to run away with his religion to Alláh and His Apostle lest he should be put to trial because of his religion. Today Alláh has made Islam triumphant, and today a believer can worship his Lord wherever he likes. But the deeds that are still rewardable (in place of emigration) are Jihad and good intentions." (See Ḥadít_h No. 42 Vol. 4).

Narrated by Aisha {#5:241 .italic}

Sad said, "O Alláh! You know that there is none against whom I am eager to fight more willingly for Your Cause than those people who disbelieved Your Apostle and drove him out (of his city). O Alláh! I think that You have ended the fight between us and them."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#5:244 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sat on the pulpit and said, "Alláh has given one of His Slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly life whatever he likes or to accept the good (of the Hereafter) which is with Alláh. So he has chosen that good which is with Alláh." On that Abu Bakr wept and said, "Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you." We became astonished at this. The people said, "Look at this old man! Alláh's Apostle talks about a Slave of Alláh to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says. 'our fathers and mothers be sacrifice(i for you." But it was Alláh's Apostle who had been given option, and Abu Bakr knew it better than we. Alláh's Apostle added, "No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is. sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:245 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don't remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Alláh's Apostle in the morning and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, "O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?" Abu Bakr replied, "My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord." Ibn Ad-Daghina said, "O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town." So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. "A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, "Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children." Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Qur’án outside his house. Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Qur’án. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Qur’án. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, "We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Qur’án publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly." Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abú- Bakr and said, ("O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man." Abu Bakr replied, "I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Alláh." At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, "In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts." So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Alláh's Apostle said to him, "Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also." Abu Bakr said, "Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!" The Prophet said, "Yes." So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Alláh's Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, "This is Alláh's Apostle with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before." Abu Bakr said, "May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Alláh, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity." So Alláh's Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. "Tell everyone who is present with you to go away." Abu Bakr replied, "There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "i have been given permission to migrate." Abu Bakr said, "Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Alláh's Apostle!" Alláh's Apostle said, "Yes." Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh's Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine." Alláh's Apostle replied, "(I will accept it) with payment." So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asmá’, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). Then Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore. The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju'sham said that his father informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju'sham saying, "The messengers of the heathens of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or arrest Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and stood up while we were sitting, and said, "O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muḥammad and his companions." Suraqa added, "I too realized that it must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.' I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muḥammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Qur’án by Alláh's Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of Alláh's Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I said to him, "Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your head." Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet said, "Do not tell others about us." Then I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered 'Amr bin Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Alláh's Apostle proceeded on his way. Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Alláh's Apostle met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Alláh's Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Alláh's Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage. The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, "O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Alláh's Apostle on the summit of Harra. The Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Alláh's Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Alláh's Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Alláh's Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Alláh's Apostle at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Alláh's Apostle said, "This place, Alláh willing, will be our abiding place." Alláh's Apostle then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, "No, but we will give it as a gift, O Alláh's Apostle!" Alláh's Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying "This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Alláh and purer and better rewardable." He was also saying, "O Alláh! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants." Thus the Prophet recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. (Ibn Shibab said, "In the Hádíths it does not occur that Alláh's Apostle recited a complete poetic verse other than this one.")

I prepared the journey food for the Prophet and Abu Bakr when they wanted (to migrate to) Medina. I said to my father (Abu Bakr), "I do not have anything to tie the container of the journey food with except my waist belt." He said, "Divide it lengthwise into two." I did so, and for this reason I was named 'Dhat-un-Nitaqain' (i.e. the owner of two belts). (Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Asmá’, Dhat-un-Nitaq.")

Narrated by Al-Bara {#5:247 .italic}

When the Prophet migrated to Medina, Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'sham pursued him. The Prophet invoked evil on him, therefore the forelegs of his horse sank into the ground. Suraqa said (to the Prophet ), "Invoke Alláh to rescue me, and I will not harm you. "The Prophet invoked Alláh for him. Then Alláh's Apostle felt thirsty and he passed by a shepherd. Abu Bakr said, "I took a bowl and milked a little milk in it and brought it to the Prophet and he drank till I was pleased."

That she conceived ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair. She added, "I migrated to Medina while I was at full term of pregnancy and alighted at Quba where I gave birth to him. Then I brought him to the Prophet and put him in his lap. The Prophet asked for a date, chewed it, and put some of its juice in the child's mouth. So, the first thing that entered the child's stomach was the saliva of Alláh's Apostle. Then the Prophet rubbed the child's palate with a date and invoked for Alláh's Blessings on him, and he was the first child born amongst the Emigrants in the Islamic Land (i.e. Medina).

Narrated by Aisha {#5:249 .italic}

The first child who was born in the Islamic Land (i.e. Medina) amongst the Emigrants, was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair. They brought him to the Prophet. The Prophet took a date, and after chewing it, put its juice in his mouth. So the first thing that went into the child's stomach, was the saliva of the Prophet.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#5:250 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while Alláh's Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr, he would day, "O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?" Abu Bakr would say, "This man shows me the Way," One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact, Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a horse-rider persuing them. He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This is a horse-rider persuing us." The Prophet looked behind and said, "O Alláh! Cause him to fall down." So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa said, "O Alláh's Prophet! Order me whatever you want." The Prophet said, "Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us." So, in the first part of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Alláh's Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a protector. Then Alláh's Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to the Ansar, and they came to Alláh's Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they said, "Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed." Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Alláh's Prophet had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying "Alláh's Prophet has come! Alláh's Prophet has come! So the Prophet went on till he alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the Prophet was speaking with the family members of Abu Aiyub, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to Alláh's Prophet and then went home. Then Alláh's Prophet said, "Which is the nearest of the houses of our Kith and kin?" Abu Aiyub replied, "Mine, O Alláh's Prophet! This is my house and this is my gate." The Prophet said, "Go and prepare a place for our midday rest." Abu Aiyub said, "Get up (both of you) with Alláh's Blessings." So when Alláh's Prophet went into the house, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salaim came and said "I testify that you (i.e. Muḥammad) are Apostle of Alláh and that you have come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam, for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct." So Alláh's Apostle sent for them, and they came and entered. Alláh's Apostle said to them, "O (the group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Alláh. By Alláh except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Alláh and that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam." The Jews replied, "We do not know this." So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then he said, "What sort of a man is ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam amongst you?" They said, "He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of the most learned amongst us." He said, "What would you think if he should embrace Islam?" They said, "Alláh forbid! He can not embrace Islam." He said, " What would you think if he should embrace Islam?" They said, "Alláh forbid! He can not embrace Islam." He said, "What would you think if he should embrace Islam?" They said, "Alláh forbid! He can not embrace Islam." He said, "O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them." He came out and said, "O (the group of) Jews! 8e afraid of Alláh except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for certain that he is Apostle of Alláh and that he has brought a True Religion!' They said, "You tell a lie." On that Alláh's Apostle turned them out.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:251 .italic}

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab fixed a grant of 4000 (Dirhams) for every Early Emigrant (i.e. Muḥájir) and fixed a grant of 3500 (Dirhams) only for Ibn ‘Umar. Somebody said to ‘Umar, "Ibn ‘Umar is also one of the Early Emigrants; why do you give him less than four-thousand?" ‘Umar replied, "His parents took him with them when they migrated, so he was not like the one who had migrated by himself.

Narrated by Khabbab {#5:252 .italic}

We migrated with Alláh's Apostle (See Ḥadít_h No. 253 below).

Narrated by Khabbab {#5:253 .italic}

We migrated with Alláh's Apostle seeking Alláh's Countenance, so our rewards became due and sure with Alláh. Some of us passed away without eating anything of their rewards in this world. One of these was Mus'ab bin ‘Umar who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud. We did not find anything to shroud his body with except a striped cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet remained uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it, his head remained uncovered. So Alláh's Apostle ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet. And there are some amongst us whose fruits have ripened and they are collecting them (i.e. they have received their rewards in this world).

Narrated by Abu Burda Bin Abi Musa Al-Ashari {#5:254 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said to me, "Do you know what my father said to your father once?" I said, "No." He said, "My father said to your father, 'O Abu Musa, will it please you that we will be rewarded for our conversion to Islam with Alláh's Apostle and our migration with him, and our Jihad with him and all our good deeds which we did, with him, and that all the deeds we did after his death will be disregarded whether good or bad?' Your father (i.e. Abu Musa) said, 'No, by Alláh, we took part in Jihad after Alláh's Apostle , prayed and did plenty of good deeds, and many people have embraced Islam at our hands, and no doubt, we expect rewards from Alláh for these good deeds.' On that my father (i.e. ‘Umar) said, 'As for myself, By Him in Whose Hand ‘Umar's soul is, I wish that the deeds done by us at the time of the Prophet remain rewardable while whatsoever we did after the death of the Prophet be enough to save us from Punishment in that the good deeds compensate for the bad ones.' " On that I said (to Ibn ‘Umar), "By Alláh, your father was better than my father!"

Narrated by Abu 'Uthman {#5:255 .italic}

I heard that Ibn ‘Umar used to become angry if someone mentioned that he had migrated before his father (‘Umar), and he used to say, " ‘Umar and I came to Alláh's Apostle and found him having his midday rest, so we returned home. Then ‘Umar sent me again (to the Prophet ) and said, 'Go and see whether he is awake.' I went to him and entered his place and gave him the pledge of allegiance. Then I went back to ‘Umar and informed him that the Prophet was awake. So we both went, running slowly, and when ‘Umar entered his place, he gave him the pledge of allegiance and thereafter I too gave him the pledge of allegiance."

Abu Bakr bought a (camel's) saddle from 'Azib, and I carried it for him. 'Azib (i.e. my father) asked Abu Bakr regarding the journey of the migration of Alláh's Apostle. Abu Bakr said, "Close observers were appointed by our enemies to watch us. So we went out at night and travelled throughout the night and the following day till it was noon, then we perceived a rock and went towards it, and there was some shade under it. I spread a cloak I had with me for Alláh's Apostle and then the Prophet layed on it. I went out to guard him and all of a sudden I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep looking for the same, the shade of the rock as we did, I asked him, 'O boy, to whom do you belong?' He replied, 'I belong to so-and-so.' I asked him, 'Is there some milk in your sheep?' He replied in the affirmative. I asked him, 'Will you milk?' He replied in the affirmative. Then he got hold of one of his sheep. I said to him, 'Remove the dust from its udder.' Then he milked a little milk. I had a water-skin with me which was tied with a piece of cloth. I had prepared the water-skin for Alláh's Apostle . So I poured some water over the milk (container) till its bottom became cold. Then I brought the milk to the Prophet and said, 'Drink, O Alláh's Apostle.' Alláh's Apostle drank till I became pleased. Then we departed and the pursuers were following us." Al-Bara added: I then went with Abu Bakr into his home (carrying that saddle) and there I saw his daughter 'Aisha Lying in a bed because of heavy fever and I saw her father Abu Bakr kissing her cheek and saying, "How are you, little daughter?"

Through another group of narrators, Anas bin Malik said,. "When the Prophet arrived at Medina, the eldest amongst his companions was Abu Bakr. He dyed his hair with Hinna and Katam till it became of dark red color.

What is there kept in the well, The well of Badr, (The owners of) lady singers And friends of the honorable companions; who used to drink (wine) together, Um Bakr greets us With the greeting of peace, But can I find peace After my people have gone? The Apostle tells us that We shall live again, But what sort of life will owls and skulls live?"

I was with the Prophet in the Cave. When I raised my head, I saw the feet of the people. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If some of them should look down, they will see us." The Prophet said, "O Abu Bakr, be quiet! (For we are) two and Alláh is the Third of us."

Once a bedouin came to the Prophet and asked him about the migration. The Prophet said, "Mercy of Alláh be on you! The migration is a quite difficult matter. Have you got some camels?" He replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet said, "Do you give their Zakat?" He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said, "Do you let others benefit by their milk gratis?" He replied in the affirmative. Then the Prophet asked, "Do you milk them on their watering days and give their milk to the poor and needy?" He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet, said, "Go on doing like this from beyond the seas, and there is no doubt that Alláh will not overlook any of your good deeds."

After that ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab came along with twenty other companions of the Prophet. Later on the Prophet himself (to Medina) and I had never seen the people of Medina so joyful as they were on the arrival of Alláh's Apostle, for even the slave girls were saying, "Alláh's Apostle has arrived!" And before his arrival I had read the Sura starting with: "Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High" (87.1) together with other Suras of Al-Mufassal.

When Alláh's Apostle came to Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal got fever, and I went to both of them and said, "O my father, how do you feel? O Bilal, how do you feel?" Whenever Abu Bakr's fever got worse, he would say, "Every man will meet his death once in one morning while he will be among his family, for death is really nearer to him than his leather shoe laces (to his feet)." And whenever fever deserted Bilal, he would say aloud, "Would that I know whether I shall spend a night in the valley (of Mecca) with Idhkhir and Jalil (i.e. kinds of grass) around me, and whether I shall drink one day the water of Mijannah, and whether I shall see once again the hills of Shamah and Tafil?" Then I went to Alláh's Apostle and told him of that. He said, "O Alláh, make us love Medina as much as or more than we used to love Mecca, O Alláh, make it healthy and bless its Sa' and Mud (i.e. measures), and take away its fever to Al-Juhfa."

The season of Hajj is the season when there comes the scum of the people (besides the good amongst them), so I recommend that you should wait till you go back to Medina, for it is the place of Migration and Sunna (i.e. the Prophet's tradition), and there you will be able to refer the matter to the religious scholars and the nobles and the people of wise opinions." ‘Umar said, "I will speak of it in Medina on my very first sermon I will deliver there."

'Uthman bin Maz'un was decided to dwell with them (i.e. Um al-'Ala's family), 'Uthman fell ill and I nursed him till he died, and we covered him with his clothes. Then the Prophet came to us and I (addressing the dead body) said, "O Abu As-Sa'ib, may Alláh's Mercy be on you! I bear witness that Alláh has honored you." On that the Prophet said, "How do you know that Alláh has honored him?" I replied, "I do not know. May my father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Alláh's Apostle! But who else is worthy of it (if not 'Uthman)?" He said, "As to him, by Alláh, death has overtaken him, and I hope the best for him. By Alláh, though I am the Apostle of Alláh, yet I do not know what Alláh will do to me," By Alláh, I will never assert the piety of anyone after him. That made me sad, and when I slept I saw in a dream a flowing stream for 'Uthman bin Maz'un. I went to Alláh's Apostle and told him of it. He remarked, "That symbolizes his (good) deeds."

The day of Bu'ath was a day (i.e. battle) which Alláh caused to take place just before the mission of His Apostle so that when Alláh's Apostle came to Medina, they (the tribes) had divided (into hostile groups) and their nobles had been killed; and all that facilitated their conversion to Islam.

When Alláh's Apostle arrived at Medina, he alighted at the upper part of Medina among the people called Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf and he stayed with them for fourteen nights. Then he sent for the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar, and they came, carrying their swords. As if I am just now looking at Alláh's Apostle on his she-camel with Abu Bakr riding behind him (on the same camel) and the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar around him till he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Aiyub's home. The Prophet used to offer the prayer wherever the prayer was due, and he would pray even in sheepfolds. Then he ordered that the mosque be built. He sent for the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar, and when they came, he said, "O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this garden of yours." They replied "No! By Alláh, we do not demand its price except from Alláh." In that garden there were the (following) things that I will tell you: Graves of pagans, unleveled land with holes and pits etc., and date-palm trees. Alláh's Apostle ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug up and, the unleveled land be leveled and the date-palm trees be cut down. The trunks of the trees were arranged so as to form the wall facing the Qibla. The Stone pillars were built at the sides of its gate.

In the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada' the Prophet visited me when I fell ill and was about to die because of that illness. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I am very ill as you see, and I am a rich man and have no heir except my only daughter. Shall I give 2/3 of my property in charity?" He said, "No." I said, "Shall I then give one half of it in charity?" He said, "O Sad! Give 1/3 (in charity) and even 1/3 is too much. No doubt, it is better to leave your children rich than to leave them poor, reduced to begging from others. And Alláh will reward you for whatever you spend with the intention of gaining Alláh's Pleasure even if it were a mouthful of food you put into your wives mouth." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Am I to be left behind (in Mecca) after my companions have gone?" He said, "If you should be left behind, you will be upgraded and elevated for every deed you will do with a desire to achieve Alláh's Pleasure. I hope that you will live long so that some people will benefit by you while others will be harmed. O Alláh! Please fulfill the migration of my companions and do not make them turn back on their heels. But (we feel sorry for) the unlucky Sad bin Khaulah." Alláh's Apostle lamented his death in Mecca.

When 'Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina and the Prophet established the bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi-al-Ansari, Saud suggested that 'Abdur-Rahman should accept half of his property and family. 'Abdur Rahman said, "May Alláh bless you in your family and property; guide me to the market." So 'Abdur-Rahman (while doing business in the market) made some profit of some condensed dry yoghurt and butter. After a few days the Prophet saw him wearing clothes stained with yellow perfume. The Prophet asked, "What is this, O 'Abdur-Rahman?" He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have married an Ansar' woman." The Prophet asked, "What have you given her as Mahr?" He (i.e. 'Abdur-Rahman) said, "A piece of gold, about the weight of a date stone." Then the Prophet said, Give a banquet, even though of a sheep."

When the news of the arrival of the Prophet at Medina reached ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam, he went to him to ask him about certain things, He said, "I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat? Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?" The Prophet replied, "Gabriel has just now informed me of that." Ibn Salam said, "He (i.e. Gabriel) is the enemy of the Jews amongst the angels. The Prophet said, "As for the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to the West. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man's discharge proceeds the woman's discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman's discharge proceeds the man's, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman." On this, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, and that you are the Apostle of Alláh." and added, "O Alláh's Apostle! Jews invent such lies as make one astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to I slam . " The Jews came, and the Prophet said, "What kind of man is ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam among you?" They replied, "The best of us and the son of the best of us and the most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us. "The Prophet said, "What would you think if ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam should embrace Islam?" They said, "May Alláh protect him from that." The Prophet repeated his question and they gave the same answer. Then ‘Abdu’lláh came out to them and said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh and that Muḥammad is the Apostle of Alláh!" On this, the Jews said, "He is the most wicked among us and the son of the most wicked among us." So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam) said, "It is this that I was afraid of, O Alláh's Apostle.

A partner of mine sold some Dirhams on credit in the market. I said, "Glorified be Alláh! Is this legal?" He replied, "Glorified be Alláh! By Alláh, when I sold them in the market, nobody objected to it." Then I asked Al-Bara' bin 'Azib (about it) he said, "We used to make such a transaction when the Prophet came to Medina. So he said, 'There is no harm in it if it is done from hand to hand, but it is not allowed on credit.' Go to Zaid bin Al- Arqam and ask him about it for he was the greatest trader of all of us." So I asked Zaid bin Al-Arqam., and he said the same (as Al-Bara) did."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#5:279 .italic}

When the Prophet arrived at Medina he found that the Jews observed fast on the day of 'Ashura'. They were asked the reason for the fast. They replied, "This is the day when Alláh caused Moses and the children of Israel to have victory over Pharaoh, so we fast on this day as a sign of glorifying it." Alláh's Apostle said, "We are closer to Moses than you." Then he ordered that fasting on this day should be observed.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Mas'ud {#5:286 .italic}

From Sad bin Mu'adh: Sad bin Mu'adh was an intimate friend of Umaiya bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay with Sad, and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya. When Alláh's Apostle arrived at Medina, Sa'd went to perform 'Umra and stayed at Umaiya's home in Mecca. He said to Umaiya, "Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to perform Tawaf around the Ka'ba." So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met them and said, "O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?" He said, "He is Sad." Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, "I see you wandering about safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter to the people who have changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and support them. By Alláh, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be able to go your family safely." Sad, raising his voice, said to him, "By Alláh, if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through Medina." On this, Umaiya said to him, "O Sad do not raise your voice before Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Mecca)." Sad said, "O Umaiya, stop that! By Alláh, I have heard Alláh's Apostle predicting that the Muslim will kill you." Umaiya asked, "In Mecca?" Sad said, "I do not know." Umaiya was greatly scared by that news. When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife, "O Um Safwan! Don't you know what Sad told me? "She said, "What has he told you?" He replied, "He claims that Muḥammad has informed them (i.e. companions that they will kill me. I asked him, 'In Mecca?' He replied, 'I do not know." Then Umaiya added, "By Alláh, I will never go out of Mecca." But when the day of (the Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, "Go and protect your caravan." But Umaiya disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said, "O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you." Abu Jahl kept on urging him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, "As you have forced me to change my mind, by Alláh, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). "O Um Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey)." She said to him, "O Abu Safwan! Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?" He said, "No, but I do not want to go with them but for a short distance." So when Umaiya went out, he used to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on doing that till Alláh caused him to be killed at Badr.

Narrated by Kab bin Malik {#5:287 .italic}

I never failed to join Alláh's Apostle in any of his Ghazawat except in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. However, I did not take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but none who failed to take part in it, was blamed, for Alláh's Apostle had gone out to meet the caravans of (Quraish, but Alláh caused them (i.e. Muslims) to meet their enemy unexpectedly (with no previous intention).

Narrated by Ibn Masud {#5:288 .italic}

I witnessed Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad in a scene which would have been dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene. He (i.e. Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the Muslims to fight with the pagans. Al-Miqdad said, "We will not say as the People of Moses said: Go you and your Lord and fight you two. (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in front of you and behind you." I saw the face of the Prophet getting bright with happiness, for that saying delighted him.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#5:289 .italic}

On the day of the battle of Badr, the Prophet said, "O Alláh! I appeal to You (to fulfill) Your Covenant and Promise. O Alláh! If Your Will is that none should worship You (then give victory to the pagans)." Then Abu Bakr took hold of him by the hand and said, "This is sufficient for you." The Prophet came out saying, "Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their backs." (54.45)

The Prophet recited Surat-an-Najm and then prostrated himself, and all who were with him prostrated too. But an old man took a handful of dust and touched his forehead with it saying, "This is sufficient for me." Later on I saw him killed as an infidel. Narrated 'Urwa (the son of Az- Zubair): Az-Zubair had three scars caused by the sword, one of which was over his shoulder and I used to insert my fingers in it. He received two of those wounds on the day of Badr and one on the day of Al-Yarmuk. When ‘Abdu’lláh bin Zubair was killed, ‘Abdu’l-Malik bin Marwan said to me, "O 'Urwa, do you recognize the sword of Az-Zubair?" I said, "Yes." He said, "What marks does it have?" I replied, "It has a dent in its sharp edge which was caused in it on the day of Badr." ‘Abdu’l- Malik said, "You are right! (i.e. their swords) have dents because of clashing with the regiments of the enemies Then ‘Abdu’l-Malik returned that sword to me (i.e. Urwa).

So Az-Zubair attacked them (i.e. Byzantine) and pierced through their lines, and went beyond them and none of his companions was with him. Then he returned and the enemy got hold of the bridle of his (horse) and struck him two blows (with the sword) on his shoulder. Between these two wounds there was a scar caused by a blow, he had received on the day of Badr (battle). When I was a child I used to play with those scars by putting my fingers in them.

So, on the third day of the battle of Badr, he ordered that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his companions followed him saying among themselves." "Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet) is proceeding for some great purpose." When he halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of the Quraish infidels by their names and their fathers' names, "O so-and-so, son of so-and-so and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so! Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed Alláh and His Apostle? We have found true what our Lord promised us. Have you too found true what your Lord promised you? "‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle!

So we found her riding her camel at the place which Alláh's Apostle had mentioned. We said (to her),"(Give us) the letter." She said, "I have no letter." Then we made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said, "Alláh's Apostle had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we will strip you naked." When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter, and we brought her to Alláh's Apostle Then ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! (This Hatib) has betrayed Alláh, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!" The Prophet asked Hatib, "What made you do this?" Hatib said, "By Alláh, I did not intend to give up my belief in Alláh and His Apostle but I wanted to have some influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Alláh might protect my family and property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through whom Alláh protects his family and property." The Prophet said, "He has spoken the truth; do no say to him but good." ‘Umar said, "He as betrayed Alláh, His Apostle and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck!" The Prophet said, "Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Alláh looked at the Badr warriors and said, 'Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, 'I have forgiven you."' On this, tears came out of ‘Umar's eyes, and he said, "Alláh and His Apostle know better."

While I was fighting in the front file on the day (of the battle) of Badr, suddenly I looked behind and saw on my right and left two young boys and did not feel safe by standing between them. Then one of them asked me secretly so that his companion may not hear, "O Uncle! Show me Abu Jahl." I said, "O nephew! What will you do to him?" He said, "I have promised Alláh that if I see him (i.e. Abu Jahl), I will either kill him or be killed before I kill him." Then the other said the same to me secretly so that his companion should not hear. I would not have been pleased to be in between two other men instead of them. Then I pointed him (i.e. Abu Jahl) out to them. Both of them attacked him like two hawks till they knocked him down. Those two boys were the sons of 'Afra' (i.e. an Ansari woman).

The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, "These dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina)," and went on tracing the Muslims' footsteps. When 'Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them and said, "Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you." 'Asim bin Thabit said, "O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O Alláh! Inform your Prophet about us." So the archers threw their arrows at them and martyred 'Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with them. The third man said, "This is the first proof of treachery! By Alláh, I will not go with you for I follow the example of these." He meant the martyred companions. The archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca after the event of the Badr battle. The sons of Al-Harit bin 'Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin 'Amr on the day (of the battle) of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his public hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, "Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing." Later on (while narrating the story) she said, "By Alláh, I had never seen a better captive than Khubaib. By Alláh, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca." She used to say," It was food Alláh had provided Khubaib with." When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr him, Khubaib requested them. "Allow me to offer a two-Rak'at prayer." They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, "By Alláh! Had I not been afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more." Then he (invoked evil upon them) saying, "O Alláh! Count them and kill them one by one, and do not leave anyone of them"' Then he recited: "As I am martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Alláh's Sake, for this is for the Cause of Alláh. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body." Then Abu Sarva, 'Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of 'Asim bin Thabit's death, sent some messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Alláh sent a swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of 'Asim, and they shielded him from the messengers who could not cut anything from his body.

Ibn ‘Umar was once told that Said bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail, one of the Badr warriors, had fallen ill on a Friday. Ibn ‘Umar rode to him late in the forenoon.

He died while she wa pregnant during Hajjat-ul-Wada.' Soon after his death, she gave birth to a child. When she completed the term of deliver (i.e. became clean), she prepared herself for suitors. Abu As-Sanabil bin Bu'kak, a man from the tribe of Bani Abd-ud-Dal called on her and said to her, "What! I see you dressed up for the people to ask you in marriage. Do you want to marry By Alláh, you are not allowed to marry unless four months and ten days have elapsed (after your husband's death)." Subai'a in her narration said, "When he (i.e. Abu As-Sanabil) said this to me. I put on my dress in the evening and went to Alláh's Apostle and asked him about this problem. He gave the verdict that I was free to marry as I had already given birth to my child and ordered me to marry if I wished."

I put my foot over his body to pull (that spear) out, but even then I had to use a great force to take it out as its both ends were bent." 'Urwa said, "Later on Alláh's Apostle asked Az-Zubair for the spear and he gave it to him. When Alláh's Apostle died, Az-Zubair took it back.

When ‘Umar died, Az-Zubair took it back, and then 'Uthman demanded it from him and he gave it to him. When 'Uthman was martyred, the spear remained with ‘Alí's offspring. Then ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair demanded it back, and it remained with him till he was martyred.

I had a she-camel which I got in my share from the booty of the battle of Badr, and the Prophet had given me another she camel from the Khumus which Alláh had bestowed on him that day. And when I intended to celebrate my marriage to Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani Qainuqa 'that he should go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by gold-smiths) which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on the marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack saddles for my two she-camels which were kneeling down beside an Ansari's dwelling and after collecting what I needed, I suddenly found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken out. On seeing that, I could not help weeping. I asked, "Who has done that?" They (i.e. the people) said, "Hamza bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib has done it. He is present in this house with some Ansari drinkers, a girl singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, "O Hamza, get at the fat she-camels!" On hearing this, Hamza rushed to his sword and cut of the camels' humps and cut their flanks open and took out portions from their livers." Then I came to the Prophet, with whom Zaid bin Haritha was present. The Prophet noticed my state and asked, "What is the matter?" I said, "O Alláh's Apostle, I have never experienced such a day as today! Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in a house along some drinkers." The Prophet asked for his cloak, put it on, and proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he reached the house where Hamza was. He asked the permission to enter, and he was permitted. The Prophet started blaming Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the Prophet then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves more to look at his face and then said, "You are not but my father's slaves." When the Prophet understood that Hamza was drunk, he retreated, walking backwards went out and we left with him.

I waited for a few days and then he said to me. 'I am of the opinion that I shall not marry at present.' Then I met Abu Bakr and said, 'if you wish, I will marry you, Hafsa bint ‘Umar.' He kept quiet and did not give me any reply and I became more angry with him than I was with Uthman . Some days later, Alláh's Apostle demanded her hand in marriage and I married her to him. Later on Abu Bakr met me and said, "Perhaps you were angry with me when you offered me Hafsa for marriage and I gave no reply to you?' I said, 'Yes.' Abu Bakr said, 'Nothing prevented me from accepting your offer except that I learnt that Alláh's Apostle had referred to the issue of Hafsa and I did not want to disclose the secret of Alláh's Apostle , but had he (i.e. the Prophet) given her up I would surely have accepted her."

So, Abu 'Ubaida arrived with the money from Bahrain. When the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu 'Ubaida (on the next day) they offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and when the morning prayer had finished, they presented themselves before him. On seeing the Ansar, Alláh's Apostle smiled and said, "I think you have heard that Abu 'Ubaida has brought something?" They replied, "Indeed, it is so, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Be happy, and hope for what will please you.

Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith (i.e. the Prophet's cousin who was still a disbeliever then) replied to Ḥasan, saying in poetic verses:-- "May Alláh bless that burning And set all its (i.e. Medina's) Parts on burning fire. You will see who is far from it (i.e. Al-Buwaira) And which of our lands will be Harmed by it (i.e. the burning of Al-Buwaira)."

That once ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab called him and while he was sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, "Will you admit 'Uthman, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, AzZubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) who are waiting for your permission?" ‘Umar said, "Yes, let them come in." After a while, Yarfa- came again and said, "Will you admit ‘Alí and ‘Abbás who are asking your permission?" ‘Umar said, "Yes." So, when the two entered, ‘Abbás said, "O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. ‘Alí). "Both of them had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Alláh had given to His Apostle as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), ‘Alí and ‘Abbás started reproaching each other. The (present) people (i.e. 'Uthman and his companions) said, "O chief of the believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other." ‘Umar said, "Wait I beseech you, by Alláh, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the earth stand fast! Do you know that Alláh's Apostle said, 'We (Prophets) our properties are not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,' and he said it about himself?" They (i.e. 'Uthman and his company) said, "He did say it. "‘Umar then turned towards ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "I beseech you both, by Alláh! Do you know that Alláh's Apostle said this?" They replied in the affirmative. He said, "Now I am talking to you about this matter. Alláh the Glorified favored His Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else. Alláh said:-- "And what Alláh gave to His Apostle ("Fai"" Booty) from them--For which you made no expedition With either Calvary or camelry. But Alláh gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And Alláh is able to do all things." (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Alláh's Apostle . But by Alláh, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it, but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of it. And from this Alláh's Apostle used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Alláh's Property is spent (i.e. in charity), Alláh's Apostle kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle.' So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Alláh's Apostle used to do, and all of you (at that time) knew all about it." Then ‘Umar turned towards ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of it in the way you have described and Alláh knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and the follower of the right. Then Alláh caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, 'I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa as Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do; and Alláh knows that I have been sincere, pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you (i.e. ‘Alí and ‘Abbás) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O ‘Abbás! You also came to me. So I told you both that Alláh's Apostle said, "Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' Then when I thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you will promise and pledge before Alláh that you will dispose it off in the same way as Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or else you should not speak to me (about it).' So, both of you said to me, 'Hand it over to us on this condition.' And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Alláh, with Whose Permission both the sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision) till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf." The sub-narrator said, "I told 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Ḥadít_h and he said, 'Malik bin Aus has told the truth" I heard 'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet saying, 'The wives of the Prophet sent 'Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Alláh had granted to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Alláh? Don't you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added: 'The family of Muḥammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of that.' So, this property (of Sadaqa) was in the hands of ‘Alí who withheld it from ‘Abbás and overpowered him. Then it came in the hands of Ḥasan bin ‘Alí, then in the hands of Ḥusayn bin ‘Alí, and then in the hands of ‘Alí bin Ḥusayn and Ḥasan bin Ḥasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn, then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Ḥasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Alláh's Apostle ."

Fatima and Al'‘Abbás came to Abu Bakr, claiming their inheritance of the Prophet's land of Fadak and his share from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said, "I heard the Prophet saying, 'Our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity. But the family of Muḥammad can take their sustenance from this property.' By Alláh, I would love to do good to the Kith and kin of Alláh's Apostle rather than to my own Kith and kin."

Would you like that I kill him?" The Prophet said, "Yes," Muḥammad bin Maslama said, "Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Kab). "The Prophet said, "You may say it." Then Muḥammad bin Maslama went to Kab and said, "That man (i.e. Muḥammad demands Sadaqa (i.e. Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from you." On that, Kab said, "By Alláh, you will get tired of him!" Muḥammad bin Maslama said, "Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or two of food." (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab said, "Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me." Muḥammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, "What do you want?" Ka'b replied, "Mortgage your women to me." They said, "How can we mortgage our women to you and you are the most handsome of the 'Arabs?" Ka'b said, "Then mortgage your sons to me." They said, "How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would be abused by the people's saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you." Muḥammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muḥammad would return to him. He came to Kab at night along with Kab's foster brother, Abu Na'ila. Kab invited them to come into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, "Where are you going at this time?" Kab replied, "None but Muḥammad bin Maslama and my (foster) brother Abu Na'ila have come." His wife said, "I hear a voice as if dropping blood is from him, Ka'b said. "They are none but my brother Muḥammad bin Maslama and my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if invited to be killed." Muḥammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators mention the men as 'Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muḥammad bin Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, "When Ka'b comes, I will touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him. I will let you smell his head." Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muḥammad bin Maslama said. " have never smelt a better scent than this. Ka'b replied. "I have got the best ‘Arab women who know how to use the high class of perfume." Muḥammad bin Maslama requested Ka'b "Will you allow me to smell your head?" Ka'b said, "Yes." Muḥammad smelt it and made his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka'b again, "Will you let me (smell your head)?" Ka'b said, "Yes." When Muḥammad got a strong hold of him, he said (to his companions), "Get at him!" So they killed him and went to the Prophet and informed him. (Abu Rafi) was killed after Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf."

Alláh's Apostle sent a group of persons to Abu Rafi. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Atik entered his house at night, while he was sleeping, and killed him.

Narrated by Al-Bara bin Azib {#5:371 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent some men from the Ansar to ((kill) Abu Rafi, the Jew, and appointed ‘Abdu’lláh bin Atik as their leader. Abu Rafi used to hurt Alláh's Apostle and help his enemies against him. He lived in his castle in the land of Ḥijáz. When those men approached (the castle) after the sun had set and the people had brought back their livestock to their homes. ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Atik) said to his companions, "Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle)." So ‘Abdu’lláh proceeded towards the castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered ‘Abdu’lláh as one of the castle's servants) addressing him saying, "O Alláh's Servant! Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate." ‘Abdu’lláh added in his story, "So I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu Rafi for a pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly entertainment went away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to myself, 'Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till I have killed him.' So I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his location in the house. So I shouted, 'O Abu Rafi!' Abu Rafi said, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, 'What is this voice, O Abu Rafi?' He said, 'Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a sword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized that I have killed him. I then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase, and thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till I sat at the gate, and said, 'I will not go out tonight till I know that I have killed him.' So, when (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall saying, 'I announce the death of Abu Rafi, the merchant of Ḥijáz. Thereupon I went to my companions and said, 'Let us save ourselves, for Alláh has killed Abu Rafi,' So I (along with my companions proceeded and) went to the Prophet and described the whole story to him. "He said, 'Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment whatsoever."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#5:372 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Atik and ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Utba with a group of men to Abu Rafi (to kill him). They proceeded till they approached his castle, whereupon ‘Abdu’lláh bin Atik said to them, "Wait (here), and in the meantime I will go and see." ‘Abdu’lláh said later on, "I played a trick in order to enter the castle. By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a flaming light to search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, 'Whoever wants to come in, should come in before I close the gate.' So I went in and hid myself in a stall of a donkey near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi and had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. When the voices vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked the gate of the castle, saying to myself, 'If these people should notice me, I will run away easily.' Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside while they were inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi by a staircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with its light off, and I could not know where the man was. So I called, 'O Abu Rafi!' He replied, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a different tone of my voice, ' What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi?' He said, 'Are you not surprised? Woe on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!' So again I aimed at him and hit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi cried loudly and his wife got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi lying straight on his back, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the sound of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to my companions limping. I said (to them), 'Go and tell Alláh's Apostle of this good news, but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi's) death.' When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, 'I convey to you the news of Abu Rafi's death.' I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I caught up with my companions before they reached the Prophet to whom I conveyed the good news."

On the day of Uhud. the Prophet said, "This is Gabriel holding the head of his horse and equipped with war material.'

Narrated by Uqba bin Amir {#5:374 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle offered the funeral prayers of the martyrs of Uhud eight years after (their death), as if bidding farewell to the living and the dead, then he ascended the pulpit and said, "I am your predecessor before you, and I am a witness on you, and your promised place to meet me will be Al-Haud (i.e. the Tank) (on the Day of Resurrection), and I am (now) looking at it from this place of mine. I am not afraid that you will worship others besides Alláh, but I am afraid that worldly life will tempt you and cause you to compete with each other for it." That was the last look which I cast on Alláh's Apostle.

Narrated by Al-Bara {#5:375 .italic}

We faced the pagans on that day (of the battle of Uhud) and the Prophet placed a batch of archers (at a special place) and appointed ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Jubair) as their commander and said, "Do not leave this place; and if you should see us conquering the enemy, do not leave this place, and if you should see them conquering us, do not (come to) help us," So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heel till I saw their women running towards the mountain, lifting up their clothes from their legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started saying, "The booty, the booty!" ‘Abdu’lláh bin Jubair said, "The Prophet had taken a firm promise from me not to leave this place." But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused (to stay there), (Alláh) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, "Is Muḥammad present amongst the people?" The Prophet said, "Do not answer him." Abu Sufyan said, "Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?" The Prophet said, "Do not answer him." Abd Sufyan said, "Is the son of Al-Khattab amongst the people?" He then added, "All these people have been killed, for, were they alive, they would have replied." On that, ‘Umar could not help saying, "You are a liar, O enemy of Alláh! Alláh has kept what will make you unhappy." Abu Safyan said, "Superior may be Hubal!" On that the Prophet said (to his companions), "Reply to him." They asked, "What may we say?" He said, "Say: Alláh is More Elevated and More Majestic!" Abu Sufyan said, "We have (the idol) Al-'Uzza, whereas you have no 'Uzza!" The Prophet said (to his companions), "Reply to him." They said, "What may we say?" The Prophet said, "Say: Alláh is our Helper and you have no helper." Abu Sufyan said, "(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it." Narrated Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as martyrs.

Narrated by Sad bin Ibrahim {#5:376 .italic}

A meal was brought to 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf while he was fasting. He said, "Musab bin ‘Umar was martyred, and he was better than I, yet he was shrouded in a Burda (i.e. a sheet) so that, if his head was covered, his feet became naked, and if his feet were covered, his head became naked." 'Abdur-Rahman added, "Hamza was martyred and he was better than 1. Then worldly wealth was bestowed upon us and we were given thereof too much. We are afraid that the reward of our deeds have been given to us in this life." 'Abdur-Rahman then started weeping so much that he left the food.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:377 .italic}

On the day of the battle of Uhud, a man came to the Prophet and said, "Can you tell me where I will be if I should get martyred?" The Prophet replied, "In Paradise." The man threw away some dates he was carrying in his hand, and fought till he was martyred .

Narrated by Khabbab bin Al-Art {#5:378 .italic}

We migrated in the company of Alláh's Apostle, seeking Alláh's Pleasure. So our reward became due and sure with Alláh. Some of us have been dead without enjoying anything of their rewards (here), and one of them was Mus'ab bin ‘Umar who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, and did not leave anything except a Namira (i.e. a sheet in which he was shrouded). If we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet said to us, "Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet." But some amongst us have got the fruits of their labor ripened, and they are collecting them. Narrated Anas: His uncle (Anas bin An-Nadr) was absent from the battle of Badr and he said, "I was absent from the first battle of the Prophet (i.e. Badr battle), and if Alláh should let me participate in (a battle) with the Prophet, Alláh will see how strongly I will fight." So he encountered the day of Uhud battle. The Muslims fled and he said, "O Alláh ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done." Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu'adh (fleeing), and asked him, "Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud." Then he proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows.

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#5:379 .italic}

When we wrote the Holy Qur’án, I missed one of the Verses of Surat-al-Ahzab which I used to hear Alláh's Apostle reciting. Then we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. The Verse was: 'Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their Covenant with Alláh, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Alláh (i.e. they have been Killed in Alláh's Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting" (33.23) So we wrote this in its place in the Qur’án.

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#5:380 .italic}

When the Prophet set out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of those who had gone out with him, returned. The companions of the Prophet were divided into two groups. One group said, "We will fight them (i.e. the enemy)," and the other group said, "We will not fight them." So there came the Divine Revelation: '(O Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about the hypocrites? Alláh has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.' (4.88) On that, the Prophet said, "That is Taiba (i.e. the city of Medina) which clears one from one's sins as the fire expels the impurities of silver."

Narrated by Jabir {#5:381 .italic}

This Verse: "When two of your parties almost Decided to fall away..." was revealed in our connection, i.e. Bani Salama and Bani Haritha and I would not have liked that, if it was not revealed, for Alláh said: But Alláh was their Protector... (3.122)

Narrated by Jabir {#5:382 .italic}

"Alláh's Apostle said to me, "Have you got married O Jabir?" I replied, "Yes." He asked "What, a virgin or a matron?" I replied, "Not a virgin but a matron." He said, "Why did you not marry a young girl who would have fondled with you?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! My father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left nine (orphan) daughters who are my nine sisters; so I disliked to have another young girl of their age, but (I sought) an (elderly) woman who could comb their hair and look after them." The Prophet said, "You have done the right thing."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:383 .italic}

That his father was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud and was in debt and left six (orphan) daughters. Jabir, added, "When the season of plucking the dates came, I went to Alláh's Apostle and said, "You know that my father was martyred on the day of Uhud, and he was heavily in debt, and I would like that the creditors should see you." The Prophet said, "Go and pile every kind of dates apart." I did so and called him (i.e. the Prophet ). When the creditors saw him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates thrice, and then sat over it and said, 'O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the creditors).' Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till Alláh paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of those dates for my sisters after Alláh had paid the debts of my father. But Alláh saved all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet had been sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof."

Narrated by Sad bin Abi Waqqas {#5:384 .italic}

I saw Alláh's Apostle on the day of the battle of Uhud accompanied by two men fighting on his behalf. They were dressed in white and were fighting as bravely as possible. I had never seen them before, nor did I see them later on.

Narrated by Sad bin Abi Waqqas {#5:385 .italic}

The Prophet took out a quiver (of arrows) for me on the day of Uhud and said, "Throw (arrows); let my father and mother be sacrificed for you."

Alláh's Apostle mentioned both his father and mother for me on the day of the battle of Uhud.

Narrated by Ibn Al Musaiyab {#5:387 .italic}

Sad bin Abi Waqqas said, "Alláh's Apostle mentioned both his father and mother for me on the day of the battle of Uhud." He meant when the Prophet said (to Sad) while the latter was fighting. "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you!"

'Uthman said that on the day of the battle of Uhud, none remained with the Prophet but Talha and Sad.

Narrated by As-Saib bin Yazíd {#5:391 .italic}

I have been in the company of 'AbdurRahman bin 'Auf, Talha bin 'Ubaidullah, Al-Miqdad and Sad, and I heard none of them narrating anything from the Prophet excepting the fact that I heard Talha narrating about the day of Uhud (battle).

Narrated by Qais {#5:392 .italic}

I saw Talha's paralyzed hand with which he had protected the Prophet on the day of Uhud.

Narrated by Anas {#5:393 .italic}

When it was the day of Uhud, the people left the Prophet while Abu Talha was in front of the Prophet shielding him with his leather shield. Abu Talha was a skillful archer who used to shoot violently. He broke two or three arrow bows on that day. If a man carrying a quiver full of arrows passed by, the Prophet would say (to him), put (scatter) its contents for Abu Talha." The Prophet would raise his head to look at the enemy, whereupon Abu Talha would say, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you ! Do not raise your head, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. (Let) my neck (be struck) rather than your neck." I saw 'Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Um Sulaim rolling up their dresses so that I saw their leg-bangles while they were carrying water skins on their backs and emptying them in the mouths of the (wounded) people. They would return to refill them and again empty them in the mouths of the (wounded) people. The sword fell from Abu Talha's hand twice or thrice (on that day).

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:394 .italic}

When it was the day of Uhud, the pagans were defeated. Then Satan, Alláh's Curse be upon him, cried loudly, "O Alláh's Worshippers, beware of what is behind!" On that, the front files of the (Muslim) forces turned their backs and started fighting with the back files. Hudhaifa looked, and on seeing his father Al-Yaman, he shouted, "O Alláh's Worshippers, my father, my father!" But by Alláh, they did not stop till they killed him. Hudhaifa said, "May Alláh forgive you." (The sub-narrator, 'Urwa, said, "By Alláh, Hudhaifa continued asking Alláh's Forgiveness for the killers of his father till he departed to Alláh (i.e. died).")

Narrated by 'Uthman bin Mauhab {#5:395 .italic}

man came to perform the Hajj to (Alláh's) House. Seeing some people sitting, he said, "Who are these sitting people?" Somebody said, "They are the people of Quraish." He said, "Who is the old man?" They said, "Ibn ‘Umar." He went to him and said, "I want to ask you about something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of this (Sacred) House, do you know that 'Uthman bin 'Affan fled on the day of Uhud?" Ibn ‘Umar said, "Yes." He said, "Do you know that he (i.e. 'Uthman) was absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?" Ibn ‘Umar said, "Yes." He said, "Do you know that he failed to be present at the Riḍván Pledge of allegiance (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?" Ibn ‘Umar replied, "Yes," He then said, "Allahu-Akbar!" Ibn ‘Umar said, "Come along; I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked. As for the flight (of 'Uthman) on the day of Uhud, I testify that Alláh forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr (battle), he was married to the daughter of Alláh's Apostle and she was ill, so the Prophet said to him, 'You will have such reward as a man who has fought the Badr battle will get, and will also have the same share of the booty.' As for his absence from the Riḍván Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than 'Uthman bin 'Affan, the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of 'Uthman. So the Prophet sent him (i.e. 'Uthman to Mecca) and the Riḍván Pledge of allegiance took place after 'Uthman had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. 'This is the hand of 'Uthman,' and clapped it over his other hand and said, "This is for 'Uthman.'" Ibn ‘Umar then said (to the man), "Go now, after taking this information."

Curse so-and-so and so-and-so" after he had said, "Alláh hears him who sends his praises to Him. Our Lord, all the Praises are for you!" So Alláh revealed: "Not for you (O Muḥammad! )...(till the end of Verse) they are indeed wrong-doers." (3.128) Salim bin ‘Abdu’lláh said' "Alláh's Apostle used to invoke evil upon Safwan bin Umaiya, Suhail bin 'Amr and Al-Harith bin Hisham. So the Verse was revealed:-- "Not for you (O Muḥammad!)...(till the end of Verse) For they are indeed wrong-doers." (3.128)

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab distributed woolen clothes amongst some women of Medina, and a nice woolen garment remained. Some of those who were sitting with him, said, "O chief of the believers! Give it to the daughter of Alláh's Apostle who is with you," and by that, they meant Um Kulthum, the daughter of ‘Alí. ‘Umar said, "Um Salit has got more right than she." Um Saht was amongst those Ansari women who had given the pledge of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle . ‘Umar added, "She (i.e. Um Salit) used to carry the filled water skins for us on the day of the battle of Uhud."

Narrated by Jafar bin 'Amr bin Umaiya {#5:399 .italic}

I went out with 'Ubaidullah bin 'Adi Al-Khaiyar. When we reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), 'Ubaidullah bin 'Adi said (to me), "Would you like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza?" I replied, "Yes." Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and somebody said to us, "He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin." So we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he greeted us in return. 'Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except his eyes and feet. 'Ubaidullah said, "O Wahshi! Do you know me?" Wahshi looked at him and then said, "No, by Alláh! But I know that 'Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child's feet." Then 'Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), "Will you tell us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?" Wahshi replied "Yes, Hamza killed Tuaima bin 'Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut'im said to me, 'If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free." When the people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of 'Ainain ..'Ainain is a mountain near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba' came out and said, 'Is there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?' Hamza bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib came out and said, 'O Siba'. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge Alláh and His Apostle?' Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Alláh's Apostle, I was told that the Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Alláh's Apostle. When he saw me, he said, 'Are you Wahshi?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Was it you who killed Hamza?' I replied, 'What happened is what you have been told of.' He said, 'Can you hide your face from me?' So I went out when Alláh's Apostle died, and Musailamah Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, 'I will go out to Musailamah so that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza. So I went out with the people (to fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him, driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders, and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, 'A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave."

That he heard Sahl bin Sad being asked about the wounds of Alláh's Apostle saying, "By Alláh, I know who washed the wounds of Alláh's Apostle and who poured water (for washing them), and with what he was treated." Sahl added, "Fatima, the daughter of Alláh's Apostle used to wash the wounds, and ‘Alí bin Abi Talib used to pour water from a shield. When Fatima saw that the water aggravated the bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burnt it, and inserted its ashes into the wound so that the blood was congealed (and bleeding stopped). His canine tooth got broken on that day, and face was wounded, and his helmet was broken on his head."

Alláh's Wrath gets severe on a person killed by a prophet, and Alláh's Wrath became severe on him who had caused the face of Alláh's Apostle to bleed.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:404 .italic}

Regarding the Holy Verse: "Those who responded (To the call) of Alláh And the Apostle (Muḥammad), After being wounded, For those of them Who did good deeds And refrained from wrong, there is a great reward." (3.172) She said to 'Urwa, "O my nephew! Your father, Az-Zubair and Abu Bakr were amongst them (i.e. those who responded to the call of Alláh and the Apostle on the day (of the battle of Uhud). When Alláh's Apostle, suffered what he suffered on the day of Uhud and the pagans left, the Prophet was afraid that they might return. So he said, 'Who will go on their (i.e. pagans') track?' He then selected seventy men from amongst them (for this purpose)." (The sub-narrator added, "Abu Bakr and Az-Zubair were amongst them.")

Narrated by Qatada {#5:405 .italic}

We do not know of any tribe amongst the ‘Arab tribes who lost more martyrs than Al-Ansar, and they will have superiority on the Day of Resurrection. Anas bin Malik told us that seventy from the Ansar were martyred on the day of Uhud, and seventy on the day (of the battle of) Bir Ma'una, and seventy on the day of Al-Yamama. Anas added, "The battle of Bir Ma'una took place during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle and the battle of Al-Yamama, during the caliphate of Abu Bakr, and it was the day when Musailamah Al-Kadhdhab was killed."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:406 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle used to shroud two martyrs of Uhud in one sheet and then say, "Which of them knew Qur’án more?" When one of the two was pointed out, he would put him first in the grave. Then he said, "I will be a witness for them on the Day of Resurrection." He ordered them to be buried with their blood (on their bodies). Neither was the funeral prayer offered for them, nor were they washed. Jabir added, "When my father was martyred, I started weeping and uncovering his face. The companions of the Prophet stopped me from doing so but the Prophet did not stop me. Then the Prophet said, '(O Jabir.) don't weep over him, for the angels kept on covering him with their wings till his body was carried away (for burial)."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#5:407 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I saw in a dream that I moved a sword and its blade got broken, and that symbolized the casualties which the believers suffered on the day of Uhud. Then I moved it again, and it became as perfect as it had been, and that symbolized the Conquest (of Mecca) which Alláh helped us to achieve, and the union of all the believers. I (also) saw cows in the dream, and what Alláh does is always beneficial. Those cows appeared to symbolize the faithful believers (who were martyred) on the day of Uhud."

Narrated by Khabbab {#5:408 .italic}

We migrated with the Prophet for Alláh's Cause, so our reward became due with Alláh. Some of us passed away (i.e. died) without enjoying anything from their reward, and one of them was Mus'ab bin ‘Umar who was killed (i.e. martyred) on the day of Uhud. He did not leave behind except a sheet of striped woolen cloth. If we covered his head with it, his feet became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. The Prophet said to us, "Cover his head with it and put Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet," or said, "Put some Idhkhir over his feet." But some of us have got their fruits ripened, and they are collecting them.

Narrated by Anas {#5:409 .italic}

The Prophet said, "This is a mountain that loves us and is loved by us."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#5:410 .italic}

When the mountain of Uhud appeared before Alláh's Apostle he said, "This IS a mountain that loves us and is loved by us. O, Alláh! Abraham made Mecca a Sanctuary, and I have made Medina (i.e. the area between its two mountains) a Sanctuary as well."

Narrated by Uqba {#5:411 .italic}

One day the Prophet went out and offered the (funeral) prayer for the people (i.e. martyrs) of Uhud as he used to offer a funeral prayer for any dead person, and then (after returning) he ascended the pulpit and said, "I am your predecessor before you, and I am a witness upon you, and I am looking at my Tank just now, and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the world (or the keys of the world). By Alláh, I am not afraid that you will worship others besides Alláh after me, but I am afraid that you will compete with each other for (the pleasures of) this world."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:412 .italic}

The Prophet sent a Sariya of spies and appointed 'Asim bin Thabit, the grandfather of 'Asim bin ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, as their leader. So they set out, and when they reached (a place) between 'Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. 'Asim and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey food from Medina. The archers said, "These are the dates of Medina," and followed their traces till they took them over. When 'Asim and his companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers encircled them and said, "You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to us, we will not kill anyone of you." 'Asim said, "As for me, I will never come down on the security of an infidel. O Alláh! Inform Your Prophet about us." So they fought with them till they killed 'Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows, and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The third man who was with them said, "This is the first breach in the covenant," and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave it to him. She said later on, "I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said 'Are you afraid that I will kill it? Alláh willing, I will never do that,' " Later on she used to say, "I have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Alláh." So they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, "Allow me to offer a two-Rak'at prayer." Then he went to them and said, "Had I not been afraid that you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time." So it was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He then said, "O Alláh! Count them one by one," and added, 'When I am being martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Alláh's Sake, because this death is in Alláh's Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs." Then 'Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish (infidels) sent some people to 'Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for 'Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day of Badr. But Alláh sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who could not harm his body consequently.

Narrated by Jabir {#5:413 .italic}

The person who killed Khubaib was Abu Sarua (i.e. 'Uqba bin Al-Harith).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l- ‘Azíz {#5:414 .italic}

Anas said, "The Prophet sent seventy men, called Al-Qurra 'for some purpose. The two groups of Bani Sulaim called Ri'l and Dhakwan, appeared to them near a well called Bir Ma'una. The people (i.e. Al-Qurra) said, 'By Alláh, we have not come to harm you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something for the Prophet.' But (the infidels) killed them. The Prophet therefore invoked evil upon them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the beginning of Al Qunut and we used not to say Qunut before that." A man asked Anas about Al-Qunut, "Is it to be said after the Bowing (in the prayer) or after finishing the Recitation (i.e. before Bowing)?" Anas replied, "No, but (it is to be said) after finishing the Recitation."

Narrated by Anas {#5:415 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said Al-Qunut for one month after the posture of Bowing, invoking evil upon some ‘Arab tribes.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#5:416 .italic}

(The tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usaiya and Bani Lihyan asked Alláh's Apostle to provide them with some men to support them against their enemy. He therefore provided them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra' in their lifetime. They used to collect wood by daytime and pray at night. When they were at the well of Ma'una, the infidels killed them by betraying them. When this news reached the Prophet , he said Al-Qunut for one month In the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the ‘Arab tribes, upon Ril, Dhakwan, 'Usaiya and Bani Libyan. We used to read a verse of the Qur’án revealed in their connection, but later the verse was cancelled. It was: "convey to our people on our behalf the information that we have met our Lord, and He is pleased with us, and has made us pleased." (Anas bin Malik added:) Alláh's Prophet said Qunut for one month in the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the ‘Arab tribes (namely), Ril, Dhakwan, Usaiya, and Bani Libyan. (Anas added:) Those seventy Ansari men were killed at the well of Mauna.

Narrated by Anas {#5:417 .italic}

That the Prophet sent his uncle, the brother of Um Sulaim at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, 'Amir bin At-Tufail proposed three suggestions (to the Prophet ) saying, "Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the bedouins will be under your command and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or that I will be your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand from Bani Ghatafan." But 'Amir was infected with plague in the House of Um so-and-so. He said, "Shall I stay in the house of a lady from the family of so-and-so after having a (swelled) gland like that she-camel? Get me my horse." So he died on the back of his horse. Then Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man from so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of 'Amir). Haram said (to his companions), "Stay near to me, for I will go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should give me protection, you will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go back to your companions. Then Haram went to them and said, "Will you give me protection so as to convey the message of Alláh's Apostle ?" So, he started talking to them' but they signalled to a man (to kill him) and he went behind him and stabbed him (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said, "Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka'ba!" The companion of Haram was pursued by the infidels, and then they (i.e. Haram's companions) were all killed except the lame man who was at the top of a mountain. Then Alláh revealed to us a verse that was among the cancelled ones later on. It was: 'We have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased.' (After this event) the Prophet invoked evil on the infidels every morning for 30 days. He invoked evil upon the (tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Alláh and His Apostle.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#5:418 .italic}

That when Haram bin Milhan, his uncle was stabbed on the day of Bir Ma'una he sprinkled his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, "I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka'ba.'

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:419 .italic}

Abu Bakr asked the Prophet to allow him to go out (of Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet said to him, ''Wait." Abu Bakr said, O Alláh's Apostle! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to migrate)?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "I hope so." So Abu Bakr waited for him till one day Alláh's Apostle came at noon time and addressed him saying "Let whoever is present with you, now leave you." Abu Bakr said, "None is present but my two daughters." The Prophet said, "Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go out (to migrate)?" Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh's Apostle, I would like to accompany you." The Prophet said, "You will accompany me." Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our) going out." So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet and it was Al-Jad'a . They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Al-Tufail bin Sakhbara 'Aisha's brother from her mother's side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. 'Amir) too went along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns till they reached Medina. 'Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma'una. Narrated 'Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma'una were martyred and 'Amr bin Umaiya Ad-Damri was taken prisoner, 'Amir bin At-Tufail, pointing at a killed person, asked Amr, "Who is this?" 'Amr bin Umaiya said to him, "He is 'Amir bin Fuhaira." 'Amir bin At-Tufail said, "I saw him lifted to the sky after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought down upon the earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet and he announced the news of their death saying, "Your companions (of Bir Ma'una) have been killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, 'O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us." So Alláh informed them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna). On that day, 'Urwa bin Asmá’ bin As-Salt who was one of them, was killed, and Urwa (bin Az-Zubair) was named after 'Urwa bin Asmá’ and Mundhir (bin AzZubair) was named after Mundhir bin 'Amr (who had also been martyred on that day).

Narrated by Anas {#5:420 .italic}

The Prophet said Al-Qunut after Bowing (i.e. Ar-Ruku') for one month, invoking evil upon (the tribes of) Ril and Dhakwan. He used to say, "Usaiya disobeyed Alláh and His Apostle."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#5:421 .italic}

The Prophet invoked evil upon those (people) who killed his companions at Bir Mauna for 30 days (in the morning prayer). He invoked evil upon (tribes of) Ril, Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Alláh and His Apostle. Alláh revealed a Qur’ánic Verse to His Prophet regarding those who had been killed, i.e. the Muslims killed at Bir Ma'una, and we recited the Verse till later it was cancelled. (The Verse was:) 'Inform our people that we have met our Lord, and He is pleased with us, and we are pleased with Him."

Narrated by Asim Al-Ahwal {#5:422 .italic}

I asked Anas bin Malik regarding Al-Qunut during the prayer. Anas replied, "Yes (Al-Qunut was said by the Prophet in the prayer)." I said, "Is it before Bowing or after Bowing?" Anas replied, "(It was said) before (Bowing)." I said, "So-and-so informed me that you told him that it was said after Bowing." Anas replied, "He was mistaken, for Alláh's Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing for one month. The Prophet had sent some people called Al-Qurra who were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Alláh's Apostle . But those who had concluded the treaty with Alláh's Apostle violated the treaty (and martyred all the seventy men). So Alláh's Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:423 .italic}

That the Prophet inspected him on the day of Uhud while he was fourteen years old, and the Prophet did not allow him to take part in the battle. He was inspected again by the Prophet on the day of Al-Khandaq (i.e. battle of the Trench) while he was fifteen years old, and the Prophet allowed him to take Part in the battle.

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#5:424 .italic}

We were with Alláh's Apostle in the Trench, and some were digging the trench while we were carrying the earth on our shoulders. Alláh's Apostle said, 'O Alláh! There is no life except the life of the Hereafter, so please forgive the Emigrants and the Ansar."

Narrated by Anas {#5:425 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle went out towards the Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and saw the Emigrants and the Ansar digging the trench in the cold morning. They had no slaves to do that (work) for them. When the Prophet saw their hardship and hunger, he said, 'O Alláh! The real life is the life of the Hereafter, so please forgive Ansar and the Emigrants." They said in reply to him, "We are those who have given the Pledge of allegiances to Muḥammad for to observe Jihad as long as we live."

Narrated by Anas {#5:426 .italic}

Al-Muhajirun (i.e. the Emigrants) and the Ansar were digging the trench around Medina and were carrying the earth on their backs while saying, "We are those who have given the pledge of allegiance to Muḥammad for Islam as long as we live." The Prophet said in reply to their saying, "O Alláh! There is no goodness except the goodness of the Hereafter; so please grant Your Blessing to the Ansar and the Emigrants." The people used to bring a handful of barley, and a meal used to be prepared thereof by cooking it with a cooking material (i.e. oil, fat and butter having a change in color and smell) and it used to be presented to the people (i.e. workers) who were hungry, and it used to stick to their throats and had a nasty smell.

Narrated by Jabir {#5:427 .italic}

We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq ( i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet and said, "Here is a rock appearing across the trench." He said, "I am coming down." Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade and struck the big solid rock and it became like sand. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to go home." (When the Prophet allowed me) I said to my wife, "I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?" She replied, "I have barley and a she goat." So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet when the dough had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly been well-cooked, and said, "I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Alláh's Apostle, you and one or two men along with you (for the food)." The Prophet asked, "How much is that food?" I told him about it. He said, "It is abundant and good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out any bread from the oven till I reach there." Then he said (to all his companions), "Get up." So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to my wife, I said, "Alláh's Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them." She said, "Did the Prophet ask you (how much food you had)?" I replied, "Yes." Then the Prophet said, "Enter and do not throng." The Prophet started cutting the bread (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the Prophet said (to my wife), "Eat and present to others as the people are struck with hunger."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:428 .italic}

When the Trench was dug, I saw the Prophet in the state of severe hunger. So I returned to my wife and said, "Have you got anything (to eat), for I have seen Alláh's Apostle in a state of severe hunger." She brought out for me, a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Alláh's Apostle . My wife said, "Do not disgrace me in front of Alláh's Apostle and those who are with him." So I went to him and said to him secretly, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e. kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and another person along with you." The Prophet raised his voice and said, "O people of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go." Alláh's Apostle said to me, "Don't put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough till I come." So I came (to my house) and Alláh's Apostle too, came, proceeding before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, "May Alláh do so-and-so to you." I said, "I have told the Prophet of what you said." Then she brought out to him (i.e. the Prophet the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Alláh's Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and invoked for Alláh's Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not put it down from its fireplace." They were one-thousand (who took their meals), and by Alláh they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being baked as if nothing had been taken from it.

As regards the following Qur’ánic Verse: "When they came on you from above and from below you (from east and west of the valley) and when the eyes grew wild and the hearts reached up to the throats..." (33.10) That happened on the day of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench).

Narrated by Al-Bara {#5:430 .italic}

The Prophet was carrying earth on the day of Al-Khandaq till his abdomen was fully covered with dust, and he was saying, "By Alláh, without Alláh we would not have been guided, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So (O Alláh), please send Sakina (i.e. calmness) upon us, and make our feet firm if we meet the enemy as the enemy have rebelled against us, and if they intended affliction, (i.e. want to frighten us and fight against us then we would not flee but withstand them)." The Prophet used to raise his voice saying, "Abaina! Abaina! (i.e. would not, we would not)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#5:431 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I have been made victorious by As-Saba (i.e. an easterly wind) and the Ad nation was destroyed by Ad-Dabur (i.e. a westerly wind)."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#5:432 .italic}

When it was the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. the clans) and Alláh's Apostle dug the trench, I saw him carrying earth out of the trench till dust made the skin of his abdomen out of my sight and he was a hairy man. I heard him reciting the poetic verses composed by Ibn Rawaha while he was carrying the earth, "O Alláh! Without You we would not have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So, (O Alláh), please send Sakina (i.e. calmness) upon us and make our feet firm if we meet the enemy, as they have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us, and fight against us) then we would not (flee but withstand them)." The Prophet would then prolong his voice at the last words.

Ibn ‘Umar said, "I went to Hafsa while water was dribbling from her twined braids. I said, 'The condition of the people is as you see, and no authority has been given to me.' Hafsa said, (to me), 'Go to them, and as they (i.e. the people) are waiting for you, and I am afraid your absence from them will produce division amongst them.' " So Hafsa did not leave Ibn ‘Umar till we went to them. When the people differed. Muawiya addressed the people saying, "'If anybody wants to say anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, for we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father." On that, Habib bin Masalama said (to Ibn ‘Umar), "Why don't you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?" ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs while I was sitting and was about to say, 'He who fought against you and against your father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,' but I was afraid that my statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my statement might be interpreted not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Alláh has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise (for those who are patient and prefer the Hereafter to this worldly life)." Habib said, "You did what kept you safe and secure (i.e. you were wise in doing so)."

On the day of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench), the Prophet said '(Let) Alláh fill their (i.e. the infidels') houses and graves with fire just as they have prevented us from offering the Middle Prayer (i.e. 'Asr prayer) till the sun had set."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:438 .italic}

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab came on the day of Al-Khandaq after the sun had set and he was abusing the infidels of Quraish saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! I was unable to offer the ('Asr) prayer till the sun was about to set." The Prophet said, "By Alláh, I have not offered this (i.e. 'Asr) prayer." So we came down along with the Prophet to Buthan where he performed ablution for the prayer and then we performed the ablution for it. Then he offered the 'Asr prayer after the sun had set, and after it he offered the Maghrib prayer.

When the Prophet returned from Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath, Gabriel came and said (to the Prophet ), You have laid down your arms? By Alláh, we angels have not laid them down yet. So set out for them." The Prophet said, "Where to go?" Gabriel said, "Towards this side," pointing towards Banu Quraiza. So the Prophet went out towards them.

Narrated by Anas {#5:444 .italic}

As if I am just now looking at the dust rising in the street of Banu Ghanm (in Medina) because of the marching of Gabriel's regiment when Alláh's Apostle set out to Banu Quraiza (to attack them).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:445 .italic}

On the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. Clans) the Prophet said, "None of you Muslims) should offer the 'Asr prayer but at Banu Quraiza's place." The 'Asr prayer became due for some of them on the way. Some of those said, "We will not offer it till we reach it, the place of Banu Quraiza," while some others said, "No, we will pray at this spot, for the Prophet did not mean that for us." Later on It was mentioned to the Prophet and he did not berate any of the two groups.

Narrated by Anas {#5:446 .italic}

Some (of the Ansar) used to present date palm trees to the Prophet till Banu Quraiza and Banu An-Nadir were conquered (then he returned to the people their date palms). My people ordered me to ask the Prophet to return some or all the date palms they had given to him, but the Prophet had given those trees to Um Aiman. On that, Um Aiman came and put the garment around my neck and said, "No, by Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, he will not return those trees to you as he (i.e. the Prophet ) has given them to me." The Prophet go said (to her), "Return those trees and I will give you so much (instead of them)." But she kept on refusing, saying, "No, by Alláh," till he gave her ten times the number of her date palms.

The people of (Banu) Quraiza agreed to accept the verdict of Sad bin Mu'adh. So the Prophet sent for Sad, and the latter came (riding) a donkey and when he approached the Mosque, the Prophet said to the Ansar, "Get up for your chief or for the best among you." Then the Prophet said (to Sad)." These (i.e. Banu Quraiza) have agreed to accept your verdict." Sad said, "Kill their (men) warriors and take their offspring as captives, "On that the Prophet said, "You have judged according to Alláh's Judgment," or said, "according to the King's judgment."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:448 .italic}

Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a man from Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-'Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man was Hibban bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin 'Amir bin Lu'ai who shot an arrow at Sad's medial arm vein (or main artery of the arm). The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the Mosque so that he might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath Gabriel came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking the dust off his head, and said, "You have laid down the arms?" By Alláh, I have not laid them down. Go out to them (to attack them)." The Prophet said, "Where?" Gabriel pointed towards Bani Quraiza. So Alláh's Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They then surrendered to the Prophet's judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict concerning them. Sad said, "I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed, their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties distributed." Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that 'Aisha said, "Sad said, "O Alláh! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to fight in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned him out (of Mecca). O Alláh! I think you have put to an end the fight between us and them (i.e. Quraish infidels). And if there still remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then keep me alive till I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.' So blood gushed from the wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the blood flowing towards them . They said, 'O people of the tent! What is this thing which is coming to us from your side?' Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of Sad's wound. Sad then died because of that."

The Prophet said to Ḥasan, "Abuse them (with your poems), and Gabriel is with you (i.e, supports you)." (Through another group of sub narrators) Al-Bara bin Azib said, "On the day of Quraiza's (besiege), Alláh's Apostle said to Ḥasan bin Thabit, 'Abuse them (with your poems), and Gabriel is with you (i.e. supports you).' "

Abu Musa said, "We went out in the company of the Prophet for a Ghazwa and we were six persons having one camel which we rode in rotation. So, (due to excessive walking) our feet became thin and my feet became thin and my nail dropped, and we used to wrap our feet with the pieces of cloth, and for this reason, the Ghazwa was named Dhat-ur-Riqa as we wrapped our feet with rags." When Abú- Musa narrated this (Ḥadít_h), he felt regretful to do so and said, as if he disliked to have disclosed a good deed of his.

Narrated by Salih bin Khawwat {#5:451 .italic}

Concerning those who witnessed the Fear Prayer that was performed in the battle of Dhat-ur-Riqa' in the company of Alláh's Apostle; One batch lined up behind him while another batch (lined up) facing the enemy. The Prophet led the batch that was with him in one Rak'a, and he stayed in the standing posture while that batch completed their (two Rakat) prayer by themselves and went away, lining in the face of the enemy, while the other batch came and he (i.e. the Prophet) offered his remaining Rak'a with them, and then, kept on sitting till they completed their prayer by themselves, and he then finished his prayer with Taslim along with them. Narrated Ibn Az-Zubair: Jabir said, "We were with the Prophet at Nakhl," and then he mentioned the Fear prayer. Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muḥammad: The Prophet offered the Fear prayer in the Ghazwa of Banu Anmar.

Narrated by Sahl bin Abi Hathma {#5:452 .italic}

(describing the Fear prayer): The Imam stands up facing the Qibla and one batch of them (i.e. the army) (out of the two) prays along with him and the other batch faces the enemy. The Imam offers one Rak'a with the first batch they themselves stand up alone and offer one bowing and two prostrations while they are still in their place, and then go away to relieve the second batch, and the second batch comes (and takes the place of the first batch in the prayer behind the Imam) and he offers the second Rak'a with them. So he completes his two-Rak'at and then the second batch bows and prostrates two prostrations (i.e. complete their second Rak'a and thus all complete their prayer)

I took part in a Ghazwa towards Najd along with Alláh's Apostle and we clashed with the enemy, and we lined up for them.

Alláh's Apostle led the Fear-prayer with one of the two batches of the army while the other (batch) faced the enemy. Then the first batch went away and took places of their companions (i.e. second batch) and the second batch came and he led his second Rak'a with them. Then he (i.e. the Prophet: finished his prayer with Taslim and then each of the two batches got up and completed their remaining one Rak'a.

Jabir mentioned that he had participated in a Ghazwa towards Najd in the company of Alláh's Apostle.

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:458 .italic}

That he fought in a Ghazwa towards Najd along with Alláh's Apostle and when Alláh's Apostle returned, he too, returned along with him. The time of the afternoon nap overtook them when they were in a valley full of thorny trees. Alláh's Apostle dismounted and the people dispersed amongst the thorny trees, seeking the shade of the trees. Alláh's Apostle took shelter under a Samura tree and hung his sword on it. We slept for a while when Alláh's Apostle suddenly called us, and we went to him, to find a bedouin sitting with him. Alláh's Apostle said, "This (bedouin) took my sword out of its sheath while I was asleep. When I woke up, the naked sword was in his hand and he said to me, 'Who can save you from me?, I replied, 'Alláh.' Now here he is sitting." Alláh's Apostle did not punish him (for that). Through another group of narrators, Jabir said, "We were in the company of the Prophet (during the battle of) Dhat-ur-Riqa', and we came across a shady tree and we left it for the Prophet (to take rest under its shade). A man from the pagans came while the Prophet's sword was hanging on the tree. He took it out of its sheath secretly and said (to the Prophet ), 'Are you afraid of me?' The Prophet said, 'No.' He said, 'Who can save you from me?' The Prophet said, Alláh.' The companions of the Prophet threatened him, then the Iqama for the prayer was announced and the Prophet offered a two Rakat Fear prayer with one of the two batches, and that batch went aside and he offered two Rak'a-t with the other batch. So the Prophet offered four Rakat but the people offered two Rakat only." (The sub-narrator) Abu Bishr added, "The man was Ghaurath bin Al-Harith and the battle was waged against Muharib Khasafa." Jabir added, "We were with the Prophet at Nakhl and he offered the Fear prayer." Abu Huraira said, "I offered the Fear prayer with the Prophet during the Ghazwa (i.e. the battle) of Najd." Abu Huraira came to the Prophet during the day of Khaibar.

I entered the Mosque and saw Abu Said Al-Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about Al-Azl (i.e. coitus interruptus). Abu Said said, "We went out with Alláh's Apostle for the Ghazwa of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus interrupt us, we said, 'How can we do coitus interruptus before asking Alláh's Apostle who is present among us?" We asked (him) about it and he said, 'It is better for you not to do so, for if any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:460 .italic}

We took part in the Ghazwa of Najd along with Alláh's Apostle and when the time for the afternoon rest approached while he was in a valley with plenty of thorny trees, he dismounted under a tree and rested in its shade and hung his sword (on it). The people dispersed amongst the trees in order to have shade. While we were in this state, Alláh's Apostle called us and we came and found a bedouin sitting in front of him. The Prophet said, "This (Bedouin) came to me while I was asleep, and he took my sword stealthily. I woke up while he was standing by my head, holding my sword without its sheath. He said, 'Who will save you from me?' I replied, 'Alláh.' So he sheathed it (i.e. the sword) and sat down, and here he is." But Alláh's Apostle did not punish him.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:462 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Alláh's Apostle used to take with him the one on whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Alláh's Apostle after Alláh's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Alláh's Apostle had finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone. Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited Istirja' (i.e. "Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji'un") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Alláh, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk (i.e. slander) more, was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai Ibn Salul." (Urwa said, "The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh's) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail." Urwa also added, "None was mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (‘Abdu’lláh) except Ḥasan bin Thabit and Mistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but they were a group as Alláh said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul." Urwa added, "'Aisha disliked to have Ḥasan abused in her presence and she used to say, 'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muḥammad's honor from you."). 'Aisha added, "After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Alláh's Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick. (But now) Alláh's Apostle would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old 'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin ‘Abbás bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said, 'What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you Hantah! Didn't you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?' Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Alláh's Apostle came to me, and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will you allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Alláh's Apostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people talking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would find faults with her.' I said, 'Subhan-Alláh! (I testify the uniqueness of Alláh). Are the people really talking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. Alláh's Apostle called ‘Alí bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama said, '(O Alláh's Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.' ‘Alí bin Abi Talib said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh does not put you in difficulty and there are plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that Alláh's Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' So, on that day, Alláh's Apostle got up on the pulpit and complained about ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Alláh, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.' Sad bin Mu'adh the brother of Banu 'Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your order.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Ḥasan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu'adh). 'By Alláh, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin Mu'adh) got up and said to Sad bin 'Ubada, 'By Alláh! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Alláh's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Alláh's Apostle kept on quietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing, and I could never sleep. In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state, Alláh's Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Alláh's Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O 'Aisha! I have been informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Alláh will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Alláh and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Alláh for forgiveness, Alláh accepts his repentance.' When Alláh's Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, 'Reply to Alláh's Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.' My father said, 'By Alláh, I do not know what to say to Alláh's Apostle .' Then I said to my mother, 'Reply to Alláh's Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By Alláh, I do not know what to say to Alláh's Apostle.' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had a little knowledge of Qur’án, I said, 'By Alláh, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Alláh knows that I am innocent, you will surely believe me. By Alláh, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is Alláh (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and Alláh knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Alláh would reveal my innocence. But, by Alláh, I never thought that Alláh would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Alláh with something of my concern, but I hoped that Alláh's Apostle might have a dream in which Alláh would prove my innocence. But, by Alláh, before Alláh's Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to Alláh's Apostle. So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When that state of Alláh's Apostle was over, he got up smiling, and the first word he said was, 'O 'Aisha! Alláh has declared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Alláh's Apostle). I replied, 'By Alláh, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Alláh. So Alláh revealed the ten Verses: "Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you..." (24.11-20) Alláh revealed those Qur’ánic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By Alláh, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.' Then Alláh revealed: "And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Alláh's cause, let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Alláh should forgive you? And Alláh is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful." (24.22) Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Alláh, I would like that Alláh forgive me.' and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him before. He also added, 'By Alláh, I will never deprive him of it at all.' Aisha further said:." Alláh's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, 'What do you know and what did you see?" She replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! I refrain from claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Alláh, I know nothing except good (about 'Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she received from the Prophet) but Alláh saved her from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said, 'Subhan-Alláh! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man was martyred in Alláh's Cause."

Al-Walid bin ‘Abdu’l- Malik said to me, "Have you heard that ‘Alí' was one of those who slandered 'Aisha?" I replied, "No, but two men from your people (named) Abu Salama bin 'Abdur-Rahman and Abu Bakr bin Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith have informed me that Aisha told them that ‘Alí remained silent about her case."

Um Ruman, the mother of 'Aisha said that while 'Aisha and she were sitting, an Ansari woman came and said, "May Alláh harm such and-such a person!" Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?" She replied, "My son was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander)." Um Ruman said, "What is that?" She said, "So-and-so...." and narrated the whole story. On that 'Aisha said, "Did Alláh's Apostle hear about that?" She replies, "yes." 'Aisha further said, "And Abu Bakr too?" She replied, "Yes." On that, 'Aisha fell down fainting, and when she came to her senses, she had got fever with rigors. I put her clothes over her and covered her. The Prophet came and asked, "What is wrong with this (lady)?" Um Ruman replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! She (i.e. 'Aisha) has got temperature with rigors." He said, "Perhaps it is because of the story that has been talked about?" She said, "Yes." 'Aisha sat up and said, "By Alláh, if I took an oath (that I am innocent), you would not believe me, and if I said (that I am not innocent), you would not excuse me. My and your example is like that of Jacob and his sons (as Jacob said ): 'It is Alláh (Alone) Whose Help can be sought against that you assert.' Um Ruman said, "The Prophet then went out saying nothing. Then Alláh declared her innocence. On that, 'Aisha said (to the Prophet), "I thank Alláh only; thank neither anybody else nor you."

I started abusing Ḥasan in front of 'Aisha. She said, "Do not abuse him as he used to defend Alláh's Apostle (against the infidels). 'Aisha added, "Once Ḥasan took the permission from the Prophet to say poetic verses against the infidels. On that the Prophet said, 'How will you exclude my forefathers (from that)? Ḥasan replied, 'I will take you out of them as one takes a hair out of the dough." Hisham's father added, "I abused Ḥasan as he was one of those who spoke against 'Aisha."

We went to 'Aisha while Ḥasan bin Thabit was with her reciting poetry to her from some of his poetic verses, saying "A chaste wise lady about whom nobody can have suspicion. She gets up with an empty stomach because she never eats the flesh of indiscreet (ladies)." 'Aisha said to him, "But you are not like that." I said to her, "Why do you grant him admittance, though Alláh said: "and as for him among them, who had the greater share therein, his will be a severe torment." (24.11) On that, 'Aisha said, "And what punishment is more than blinding?" She, added, "Ḥasan used to defend or say poetry on behalf of Alláh's Apostle (against the infidels)."

We went out with Alláh's Apostle in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. One night it rained and Alláh's Apostle led us in the Fajr prayer and (after finishing it), turned to us and said, " Do you know what your Lord has said?" We replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know it better." He said, "Alláh said:-- "(Some of) My slaves got up believing in Me, And (some of them) disbelieving in Me. The one who said: We have been given Rain through Alláh's Mercy and Alláh's Blessing and Alláh's Bounty, Then he is a believer in Me, and is a Disbeliever in the star. And whoever said: We have been given rain because of such-and-such star, Then he is a believer in the star, and is a disbeliever in Me."

Alláh's Apostle performed four 'Umras, all in the month of Dhul-Qa'da, except the one which he performed with his Hajj (i.e. in Dhul-Hijja). He performed one 'Umra from Al-Hudaibiya in Dhul-Qa'da, another 'Umra in the following year in Dhul Qa'da a third from Al-Jirana where he distributed the war booty of Hunain, in Dhul Qa'da, and the fourth 'Umra he performed was with his Hajj.

Narrated by Al-Bara {#5:471 .italic}

Do you (people) consider the conquest of Mecca, the Victory (referred to in the Qur’án 48:1). Was the conquest of Mecca a victory? We really consider that the actual Victory was the Ar-Riḍván Pledge of allegiance which we gave on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (to the Prophet) . On the day of Al-Hudaibiya we were fourteen hundred men along with the Prophet Al-Hudaibiya was a well, the water of which we used up leaving not a single drop of water in it. When the Prophet was informed of that, he came and sat on its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution from it, rinsed (his mouth), invoked (Alláh), and poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for a while and then the well brought forth what we required of water for ourselves and our riding animals.

Narrated by Al-Bara bin Azib {#5:472 .italic}

That they were in the company of Alláh's Apostle on the day of Al-Hudaibiya and their number was 1400 or more. They camped at a well and drew its water till it was dried. When they informed Alláh's Apostle of that, he came and sat over its edge and said, "Bring me a bucket of its water." When it was brought, he spat and invoked (Alláh) and said, "Leave it for a while." Then they quenched their thirst and watered their riding animals (from that well) till they departed.

Narrated by Salim {#5:473 .italic}

Jabir said "On the day of Al-Hudaibiya, the people felt thirsty and Alláh's Apostle had a utensil containing water. He performer ablution from it and then the people came towards him. Alláh's Apostle said, 'What is wrong with you?' The people said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! We haven't got any water to perform ablution with or to drink, except what you have in your utensil.' So the Prophet put his hand in the utensil and the water started spouting out between his fingers like springs. So we drank and performed ablution." I said to Jabir, "What was your number on that day?" He replied, "Even if we had been one hundred thousand, that water would have been sufficient for us. Anyhow, we were 1500.'

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:475 .italic}

On the day of Al-Hudaibiya, Alláh's Apostle said to us' "You are the best people on the earth!" We were 1400 then. If I could see now, I would have shown you the place of the Tree (beneath which the Pledge of allegiance was given by us)," Salim said, "Our number was 1400." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Aufa said, "The people (who gave the Pledge of allegiance) under the Tree numbered 1300 and the number of Bani Aslam was 1/8 of the Emigrants."

Narrated by Mirdas Al-Aslami {#5:476 .italic}

Who was among those (who had given the Pledge of allegiance) under the Tree: Pious people will die in succession, and there will remain the dregs of society who will be like the useless residues of dates and barley and Alláh will pay no attention to them.

Narrated by Kab bin Ujra {#5:478 .italic}

That Alláh's Apostle saw him with the lice falling (from his head) on his face. Alláh's Apostle said, "Are your lice troubling you? Ka'b said, "Yes." Alláh's Apostle thus ordered him to shave his head while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. Up to then there was no indication that all of them would finish their state of Ihram and they hoped that they would enter Mecca. Then the order of Al-Fidya was revealed, so Alláh's Apostle ordered Kab to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or slaughter a sheep or fast for three days.

Narrated by Aslam {#5:479 .italic}

Once I went with ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab to the market. A young woman followed ‘Umar and said, "O chief of the believers! My husband has died, leaving little children. By Alláh, they have not even a sheep's trotter to cook; they have no farms or animals. I am afraid that they may die because of hunger, and I am the daughter of Khufaf bin Ima Al-Ghafari, and my father witnessed the Pledge of allegiance) of Al-Hudaibiya with the Prophet.' ‘Umar stopped and did not proceed, and said, "I welcome my near relative." Then he went towards a strong camel which was tied in the house, and carried on to it, two sacks he had loaded with food grains and put between them money and clothes and gave her its rope to hold and said, "Lead it, and this provision will not finish till Alláh gives you a good supply." A man said, "O chief of the believers! You have given her too much." "‘Umar said disapprovingly. "May your mother be bereaved of you! By Alláh, I have seen her father and brother besieging a fort for a long time and conquering it, and then we were discussing what their shares they would have from that war booty."

Then I went to Sa‘íd bin Musaiyab and informed him about it. Said said, "My father said that he was amongst those who had given the Pledge of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle beneath the Tree. He (i.e. my father) said, "When we set out the following year, we forgot the Tree and were unable to recognize it.

He asked him again (for the third time) but he did not answer him. On that ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab addressed himself saying, "May your mother be bereaved of you, O ‘Umar, for you have asked Alláh's Apostle thrice, yet he has not answered you." ‘Umar said, "Then I made my camel run fast and took it in front of the other Muslims, and I was afraid that something might be revealed in my connection. I had hardly waited for a moment when I heard somebody calling me. I said, 'I was afraid that something might have been revealed about me.' Then I came to Alláh's Apostle and greeted him. He (i.e. the Prophet) said, 'Tonight there has been revealed to me, a Sura which is dearer to me than (all the world) on which the sun rises,' and then he recited: 'Verily! We have granted you (O Muḥammad) A manifest victory." (48.1)

Narrated by Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan bin Al-Hakam {#5:495 .italic}

(one of them said more than his friend): The Prophet set out in the company of more than one-thousand of his companions in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and when he reached Dhul-Hulaifa, he garlanded his Hádí (i.e. sacrificing animal), assumed the state of Ihram for 'Umra from that place and sent a spy of his from Khuzi'a (tribe). The Prophet proceeded on till he reached (a village called) Ghadir-al-Ashtat. There his spy came and said, "The Quraish (infidels) have collected a great number of people against you, and they have collected against you the Ethiopians, and they will fight with you, and will stop you from entering the Ka'ba and prevent you." The Prophet said, "O people! Give me your opinion. Do you recommend that I should destroy the families and offspring of those who want to stop us from the Ka'ba? If they should come to us (for peace) then Alláh will destroy a spy from the pagans, or otherwise we will leave them in a miserable state." On that Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh Apostle! You have come with the intention of visiting this House (i.e. Ka'ba) and you do not want to kill or fight anybody. So proceed to it, and whoever should stop us from it, we will fight him." On that the Prophet said, "Proceed on, in the Name of Alláh !"

Narrated by Urwa bin Az-Zubair {#5:496 .italic}

That he heard Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama relating one of the events that happened to Alláh's Apostle in the 'Umra of Al-Hudaibiya. They said, "When Alláh's Apostle concluded the truce with Suhail bin 'Amr on the day of Al-Hudaibiya, one of the conditions which Suhail bin 'Amr stipulated, was his saying (to the Prophet), "If anyone from us (i.e. infidels) ever comes to you, though he has embraced your religion, you should return him to us, and should not interfere between us and him." Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Alláh's Apostle except on this condition. The believers disliked this condition and got disgusted with it and argued about it. But when Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Alláh's Apostle except on that condition, Alláh's Apostle concluded it. Accordingly, Alláh's Apostle then returned Abu Jandal bin Suhail to his father, Suhail bin 'Amr, and returned every man coming to him from them during that period even if he was a Muslim. The believing women Emigrants came (to Medina) and Um Kulthum, the daughter of 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait was one of those who came to Alláh's Apostle and she was an adult at that time. Her relatives came, asking Alláh's Apostle to return her to them, and in this connection, Alláh revealed the Verses dealing with the believing (women). Aisha said, "Alláh's Apostle used to test all the believing women who migrated to him, with the following Verse:-- "O Prophet! When the believing Women come to you, to give the pledge of allegiance to you." (60.12) 'Urwa's uncle said, "We were informed when Alláh ordered His Apostle to return to the pagans what they had given to their wives who lately migrated (to Medina) and we were informed that Abu Basir..." relating the whole narration.

Narrated by Nafi {#5:497 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar set out for Umra during the period of afflictions, and he said, "If I should be stopped from visiting the Kaba, I will do what we did when we were with Alláh's Apostle." He assumed Ihram for 'Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya.

Narrated by Nafi {#5:498 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar assumed Ihram and said, "If something should intervene between me and the Ka'ba, then I will do what the Prophet did when the Quraish infidels intervened between him and (the Ka'ba). Then Ibn ‘Umar recited: "You have indeed in Alláh's Apostle A good example to follow." (33.21)

Narrated by Nafi {#5:499 .italic}

One of ‘Abdu’lláh's sons said to ‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Umar) "I wish you would stay this year (and not perform Hajj) as I am afraid that you will not be able to reach the Kaba." On that he (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar) said, "We went out with the Prophet (for 'Umra), and when the Quraish infidel intervened between us and the Ka'ba, the Prophet slaughtered his Hádí and shaved (his head), and his companions cut short their hair." Then ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "I make you witness that I have intended to perform 'Umra and if I am allowed to reach the Kaba, I will perform the Tawaf, and if something (i.e. obstacles) intervene between me and the Kaba, then I will do what Alláh's Apostle did." Then after going for a while, he said, "I consider the ceremonies (of both 'Umra and Hajj as one and the same, so I would like you to witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with my 'Umra." So he performed only one Tawaf and one Sai (between Safa and Marwa) and finished the Ihram of both Umra and Hajj).

Narrated by Nafi {#5:500 .italic}

The people used to say that Ibn ‘Umar had embraced Islam before ‘Umar. This is not true. What happened is that ‘Umar sent ‘Abdu’lláh to bring his horse from an Ansari man so as to fight on it. At that time the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle near the Tree, and ‘Umar was not aware of that. So ‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Umar) gave the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the horse and brought it to ‘Umar. While ‘Umar was putting on the armor to get ready for fighting, ‘Abdu’lláh informed him that the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle beneath the Tree. So ‘Umar set out and ‘Abdu’lláh accompanied him till he gave the Pledge of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle, and it was this event that made people say that Ibn ‘Umar had embraced Islam before ‘Umar. "‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar added, "The people were along with the Prophet on the day of Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the shade of the trees. Suddenly the people surrounded the Prophet and started looking at him." ‘Umar said, "O ‘Abdu’lláh! Go and see why the people are encircling Alláh's Apostle and looking at him." ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar then saw the people giving the Pledge o allegiance to the Prophet. So he also gave the Pledge of allegiance and returned to ‘Umar who went out in his turn and gave the Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet.'

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Aufa {#5:501 .italic}

We were in the company of the Prophet when he performed the 'Umra. He performed the Tawaf and we did the same; he offered the prayer and we also offered the prayer with him. Then he performed the Sai between Safa and Marwa and we were guarding him against the people of Mecca so that nobody should harm him.

Narrated by Abu Wail {#5:502 .italic}

When Sahl bin Hunaif returned from (the battle of) Siffin, we went to ask him (as to why he had come back). He replied, "(You should not consider me a coward) but blame your opinions. I saw myself on the day of Abu Jandal (inclined to fight), and if I had the power of refusing the order of Alláh's Apostle then, I would have refused it (and fought the infidels bravely). Alláh and His Apostle know (what is convenient) better. Whenever we put our swords on our shoulders for any matter that terrified us, our swords led us to an easy agreeable solution before the present situation (of disagreement and dispute between the Muslims). When we mend the breach in one side, it opened in another, and we do not know what to do about it."

Narrated by Kab bin Ujra {#5:503 .italic}

The Prophet came to me at the time of Al-Hudaibiya Pledge while lice were falling on my face. He said, "Are the lice of your head troubling you?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Shave your head and fast for three days, or feed six poor persons, or slaughter a sheep as sacrifice." (The sub-narrator, Aiyub said, "I do not know with which of these three options he started.")

Narrated by Ka'b bin Ujra {#5:504 .italic}

We were in the company of Alláh's Apostle at Al-Hudaibiya in the state of Ihram and the pagans did not allow us to proceed (to the Ka'ba). I had thick hair and lice started falling on my face. The Prophet passed by me and said, "Are the lice of your head troubling you?" I replied, Yes." (The sub-narrator added, "Then the following Divine Verse was revealed:-- "And if anyone of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp, (necessitating shaving) must pay a ransom (Fida) of either fasting or feeding the poor, Or offering a sacrifice." (2.196)

Narrated by Anas {#5:505 .italic}

Some people of the tribe of 'Ukl and 'Uraina arrived at Medina to meet the Prophet and embraced Islam and said, "O Alláh's Prophet! We are the owners of milch livestock (i.e. bedouins) and not farmers (i.e. countrymen)." They found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Alláh's Apostle ordered that they should be provided with some milch camels and a shepherd and ordered them to go out of Medina and to drink the camels' milk and urine (as medicine) So they set out and when they reached Al-Harra, they reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam, and killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet, he sent some people in pursuit of them. (So they were caught and brought back to the Prophet ). The Prophet gave his orders in their concern. So their eyes were branded with pieces of iron and their hands and legs were cut off and they were left away in Harra till they died in that state of theirs. (See Ḥadít_h 234 Vol 1)

The freed slave of Abu Qilaba, who was with Abu Qilaba in Sham: ‘Umar bin ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz consulted the people saying, "What do you think of Qasama." They said, "'It is a right (judgment) which Alláh's Apostle and the Caliphs before you acted on." Abu Qilaba was behind ‘Umar's bed. 'Anbasa bin Said said, But what about the narration concerning the people of Uraina?" Abu Qilaba said, "Anas bin Malik narrated it to me," and then narrated the whole story.

Narrated by Salama bin Al-Akwa {#5:507 .italic}

Once I went (from Medina) towards (Al-Ghaba) before the first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The she-camels of Alláh's Apostle used to graze at a place called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf met me (on the way) and said, "The she-camels of Alláh's Apostle had been taken away by force." I asked, "Who had taken them?" He replied "(The people of) Ghatafan." I made three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, "O Sabahah!" I made the people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as I was a good archer and I was saying, "I am the son of Al-Akwa', and today will perish the wicked people." I kept on saying like that till I restored the she-camels (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet and the other people came there, and I said, "O Alláh's Prophet! I have stopped the people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people) after them now." On that the Prophet said, "O the son of Al-Akwa'! You have over-powered them, so forgive them." Then we all came back and Alláh's Apostle seated me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina.

Narrated by Suwaid bin An-Numan {#5:508 .italic}

I went out in the company of the Prophet in the year of Khaibar, and when we reached As Sahba' which is the lower part of Khaibar, the Prophet offered the Asr prayer and then asked the people to collect the journey food. Nothing was brought but Sawiq which the Prophet ordered to be moistened with water, and then he ate it and we also ate it. Then he got up to offer the Maghrib prayer. He washed his mouth, and we too washed our mouths, and then he offered the prayer without repeating his abulution.

Narrated by Salama bin Al-Akwa {#5:509 .italic}

We went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While we were proceeding at night, a man from the group said to 'Amir, "O 'Amir! Won't you let us hear your poetry?" 'Amir was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for the people poetry that kept pace with the camels' footsteps, saying:-- "O Alláh! Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others' help Against us." The Prophet on that, asked, "Who is that (camel) driver (reciting poetry)?" The people said, "He is 'Amir bin Al-Akwa'." Then the Prophet said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on him." A man amongst the people said, "O Alláh's Prophet! has (martyrdom) been granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer." Then we reached and besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Alláh helped the Muslims conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, "What are these fires? For cooking what, are you making the fire?" The people replied, "(For cooking) meat." He asked, "What kind of meat?" They (i.e. people) said, "The meat of donkeys." The Prophet said, "Throw away the meat and break the pots!" Some man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots instead?" He said, "(Yes, you can do) that too." So when the army files were arranged in rows (for the clash), 'Amir's sword was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Alláh's Apostle saw me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, "What is bothering you?" I replied, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the deeds of 'Amir are lost." The Prophet said, "Whoever says so, is mistaken, for 'Amir has got a double reward." The Prophet raised two fingers and added, "He (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Alláh and there are few 'Arabs who achieved the like of (good deeds) 'Amir had done."

Narrated by Anas {#5:510 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle reached Khaibar at night and it was his habit that, whenever he reached the enemy at night, he will not attack them till it was morning. When it was morning, the Jews came out with their spades and baskets, and when they saw him(i.e. the Prophet ), they said, "Muḥammad! By Alláh! Muḥammad and his army!" The Prophet said, "Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned." Narrated Anas bin Malik: We reached Khaibar early in the morning and the inhabitants of Khaibar came out carrying their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said, "Muḥammad! By Alláh! Muḥammad and his army!" The Prophet said, "Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned." We then got the meat of donkeys (and intended to eat it), but an announcement was made by the announcer of the Prophet, "Alláh and His Apostle forbid you to eat the meat of donkeys as it is an impure thing."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#5:511 .italic}

Someone came to Alláh's Apostles and said, "The donkeys have been eaten (by the Muslims)." The Prophet kept quiet. Then the man came again and said, "The donkeys have been eaten." The Prophet kept quiet. The man came to him the third time and said, "The donkeys have been consumed." On that the Prophet ordered an announcer to announce to the people, "Alláh and His Apostle forbid you to eat the meat of donkeys." Then the cooking pots were upset while the meat was still boiling in them.

Narrated by Anas {#5:512 .italic}

The Prophet offered the Fajr Prayer near Khaibar when it was still dark and then said, "Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned." Then the inhabitants of Khaibar came out running on the roads. The Prophet had their warriors killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives. Safiya was amongst the captives, She first came in the share of Dahya Alkali but later on she belonged to the Prophet. The Prophet made her manumission as her 'Mahr'.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz bin Suhaib {#5:513 .italic}

Anas bin Malik said, "The Prophet took Safiya as a captive. He manumitted her and married her." Thabit asked Anas, "What did he give her as Mahr (i.e. marriage gift)?" Anas replied. "Her Mahr was herself, for he manumitted her."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad As Saidi {#5:514 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle (and his army) encountered the pagans and the two armies.,, fought and then Alláh's Apostle returned to his army camps and the others (i.e. the enemy) returned to their army camps. Amongst the companions of the Prophet there was a man who could not help pursuing any single isolated pagan to strike him with his sword. Somebody said, "None has benefited the Muslims today more than so-and-so." On that Alláh's Apostle said, "He is from the people of the Hell-Fire certainly." A man amongst the people (i.e. Muslims) said, "I will accompany him (to know the fact)." So he went along with him, and whenever he stopped he stopped with him, and whenever he hastened, he hastened with him. The (brave) man then got wounded severely, and seeking to die at once, he planted his sword into the ground and put its point against his chest in between his breasts, and then threw himself on it and committed suicide. On that the person (who was accompanying the deceased all the time) came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "I testify that you are the Apostle of Alláh." The Prophet said, "Why is that (what makes you say so)?" He said "It is concerning the man whom you have already mentioned as one of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire. The people were surprised by your statement, and I said to them, "I will try to find out the truth about him for you." So I went out after him and he was then inflicted with a severe wound and because of that, he hurried to bring death upon himself by planting the handle of his sword into the ground and directing its tip towards his chest between his breasts, and then he threw himself over it and committed suicide." Alláh's Apostle then said, "A man may do what seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of Paradise but he is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and another may do what seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from the dwellers of Paradise."

We witnessed (the battle of) Khaibar. Alláh's Apostle said about one of those who were with him and who claimed to be a Muslim. "This (man) is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire." When the battle started, that fellow fought so violently and bravely that he received plenty of wounds. Some of the people were about to doubt (the Prophet's statement), but the man, feeling the pain of his wounds, put his hand into his quiver and took out of it, some arrows with which he slaughtered himself (i.e. committed suicide). Then some men amongst the Muslims came hurriedly and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh has made your statement true so-and-so has committed suicide. "The Prophet said, "O so-and-so! Get up and make an announcement that none but a believer will enter Paradise and that Alláh may support the religion with an unchaste (evil) wicked man.

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ashari {#5:516 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle fought the battle of Khaibar, or when Alláh's Apostle went towards it, (whenever) the people, (passed over a high place overlooking a valley, they raised their voices saying, "Allahu-Akbar! Allahu-Akbar! None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh." On that Alláh's Apostle said (to them), "Lower your voices, for you are not calling a deaf or an absent one, but you are calling a Hearer Who is near and is with you." I was behind the riding animal of Alláh's Apostle and he heard me saying. "There Is neither might, nor power but with Alláh," On that he said to me, "O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais!" I said, "Labbaik. O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Shall I tell you a sentence which is one of the treasures of Paradise" I said, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle! Let my father and mother be sacrificed for your sake." He said, "It is: There is neither might nor power but with Alláh."

I saw the trace of a wound in Salama's leg. I said to him, "O Abu Muslim! What is this wound?" He said, "This was inflicted on me on the day of Khaibar and the people said, 'Salama has been wounded.' Then I went to the Prophet and he puffed his saliva in it (i.e. the wound) thrice., and since then I have not had any pain in it till this hour."

Narrated by Sahl {#5:518 .italic}

During one of his Ghazawat, the Prophet encountered the pagans, and the two armies fought, and then each of them returned to their army camps. Amongst the (army of the) Muslims there was a man who would follow every pagan separated from the army and strike him with his sword. It was said, "O Alláh's Apostle! None has fought so satisfactorily as so-and-so (namely, that brave Muslim). "The Prophet said, "He is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire." The people said, "Who amongst us will be of the dwellers of Paradise if this (man) is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire?" Then a man from amongst the people said, "I will follow him and accompany him in his fast and slow movements." The (brave) man got wounded, and wanting to die at once, he put the handle of his sword on the ground and its tip in between his breasts, and then threw himself over it, committing suicide. Then the man (who had watched the deceased) returned to the Prophet and said, "I testify that you are Apostle of Alláh." The Prophet said, "What is this?" The man told him the whole story. The Prophet said, "A man may do what may seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of Paradise, but he is of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and a man may do what may seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from the dwellers of Paradise."

‘Alí remained behind the Prophet during the Ghazwa of Khaibar as he was suffering from eye trouble. He then said, "(How can) I remain behind the Prophet ," and followed him. So when he slept on the night of the conquest of Khaibar, the Prophet said, "I will give the flag tomorrow, or tomorrow the flag will be taken by a man who is loved by Alláh and His Apostle , and (Khaibar) will be conquered through him, (with Alláh's help)" While every one of us was hopeful to have the flag, it was said, "Here is ‘Alí" and the Prophet gave him the flag and Khaibar was conquered through him (with Alláh's Help).

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#5:521 .italic}

On the day of Khaibar, Alláh's Apostle said, "Tomorrow I will give this flag to a man through whose hands Alláh will give us victory. He loves Alláh and His Apostle, and he is loved by Alláh and His Apostle." The people remained that night, wondering as to who would be given it. In the morning the people went to Alláh's Apostle and everyone of them was hopeful to receive it (i.e. the flag). The Prophet said, "Where is ‘Alí bin Abi Talib?" It was said, "He is suffering from eye trouble O Alláh's Apostle." He said, "Send for him." ‘Alí was brought and Alláh's Apostle spat in his eye and invoked good upon him. So ‘Alí was cured as if he never had any trouble. Then the Prophet gave him the flag. ‘Alí said "O Alláh's Apostle! I will fight with them till they become like us." Alláh's Apostle said, "Proceed and do not hurry. When you enter their territory, call them to embrace Islam and inform them of Alláh's Rights which they should observe, for by Alláh, even if a single man is led on the right path (of Islam) by Alláh through you, then that will be better for you than the nice red camels.

We arrived at Khaibar, and when Alláh helped His Apostle to open the fort, the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtaq whose husband had been killed while she was a bride, was mentioned to Alláh's Apostle. The Prophet selected her for himself, and set out with her, and when we reached a place called Sidd-as-Sahba,' Safiya became clean from her menses then Alláh's Apostle married her. Hais (i.e. an 'Arabian dish) was prepared on a small leather mat. Then the Prophet said to me, "I invite the people around you." So that was the marriage banquet of the Prophet and Safiya. Then we proceeded towards Medina, and I saw the Prophet, making for her a kind of cushion with his cloak behind him (on his camel). He then sat beside his camel and put his knee for Safiya to put her foot on, in order to ride (on the camel).

The Prophet stayed for three rights between Khaibar and Medina and was married to Safiya. I invited the Muslim to h s marriage banquet and there wa neither meat nor bread in that banquet but the Prophet ordered Bilal to spread the leather mats on which dates, dried yogurt and butter were put. The Muslims said amongst themselves, "Will she (i.e. Safiya) be one of the mothers of the believers, (i.e. one of the wives of the Prophet ) or just (a lady captive) of what his right-hand possesses" Some of them said, "If the Prophet makes her observe the veil, then she will be one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of the Prophet's wives), and if he does not make her observe the veil, then she will be his lady slave." So when he departed, he made a place for her behind him (on his and made her observe the veil.

We where afflicted with severe hunger on the day of Khaibar. While the cooking pots were boiling and some of the food was well-cooked, the announcer of the Prophet came to say, "Do not eat anything the donkey-meat and upset the cooking pots." We then thought that the Prophet had prohibited such food because the Khumus had not been taken out of it. Some others said, "He prohibited the meat of donkeys from the point of view of principle, because donkeys used to eat dirty things."

Narrated by Al-Bara and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abl Aufa {#5:532 .italic}

Uthman bin 'Affan and I went to the Prophet and said, "You had given Banu Al-Muttalib from the Khumus of Khaibar's booty and left us in spite of the fact that we and Banu Al-Muttalib are similarly related to you." The Prophet said, "Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib only are one and the same." So the Prophet did not give anything to Banu Abd Shams and Banu Nawfal.

Narrated by Abu Musa {#5:539 .italic}

The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met Ja'far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the people of the ship, "We have migrated before you." Asmá’ bint 'Umais who was one of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife the Prophet . She had migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. ‘Umar came to Hafsa while Asmá’ bint 'Umais was with her. ‘Umar, on seeing Asmá’,' said, "Who is this?" She said, "Asmá’ bint 'Umais," ‘Umar said, "Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the sea-faring lady?" Asmá’ replied, "Yes." ‘Umar said, "We have migrated before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Alláh's Apostle " On that Asmá’ became angry and said, "No, by Alláh, while you were with Alláh's Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake of Alláh's Apostle . By Alláh, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I inform Alláh's Apostle of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I will mention this to the Prophet and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add something to it." So when the Prophet came, she said, "O Alláh's Prophet ‘Umar has said so-and-so." He said (to Asmá’), "What did you say to him?" Asmá’'s aid, "I told him so-and-so." The Prophet said, "He (i.e. ‘Umar) has not got more right than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of) only one migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward of) two migrations." Asmá’ later on said, "I saw Abu Musa and the other people of the boat coming to me in successive groups, asking me about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was more cheerful and greater than what the Prophet had said about them." Narrated Abu Burda: Asmá’ said, "I saw Abu Musa requesting me to repeat this narration again and again." Narrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, "The Prophet said, "I recognize the voice of the group of Al-Ashariyun, when they recite the Qur’án, when they enter their homes at night, and I recognize their houses by (listening) to their voices when they are reciting the Qur’án at night although I have not seen their houses when they came to them during the day time. Amongst them is Ḥakím who, on meeting the cavalry or the enemy, used to say to them (i.e. the enemy). My companions order you to wait for them.' "

Narrated by Abu Musa {#5:540 .italic}

We came upon the Prophet after he had conquered Khaibar. He then gave us a share (from the booty), but apart from us he did not give to anybody else who did not attend the Conquest.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:541 .italic}

When we conquered Khaibar, we gained neither gold nor silver as booty, but we gained cows, camels, goods and gardens. Then we departed with Alláh's Apostle to the valley of Al-Qira, and at that time Alláh's Apostle had a slave called Mid'am who had been presented to him by one of Banu Ad-Dibbab. While the slave was dismounting the saddle of Alláh's Apostle an arrow the thrower of which was unknown, came and hit him. The people said, "Congratulations to him for the martyrdom." Alláh's Apostle said, "No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the sheet (of cloth) which he had taken (illegally) on the day of Khaibar from the booty before the distribution of the booty, has become a flame of Fire burning him." On hearing that, a man brought one or two leather straps of shoes to the Prophet and said, "These are things I took (illegally)." On that Alláh's Apostle said, "This is a strap, or these are two straps of Fire."

Narrated by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab {#5:542 .italic}

By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, were I not afraid that the other Muslims might be left in poverty, I would divide (the land of) whatever village I may conquer (among the fighters), as the Prophet divided the land of Khaibar. But I prefer to leave it as a (source of) a common treasury for them to distribute it revenue amongst themselves.

Narrated by ‘Umar {#5:543 .italic}

But for the other Muslims (i.e. coming generations) I would divide (the land of) whatever villages the Muslims might conquer (among the fighters), as the Prophet divided (the land of) Khaibar.

Abu Huraira came to the Prophet and asked him (for a share from the Khaibar booty). On that, one of the sons of Said bin Al-'As said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do not give him." Abu Huraira then said (to the Prophet ) "This is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal." Sa‘íd's son said, "How strange! A guinea pig coming from Qadum Ad-Dan!" Narrated Abu Huraira: Alláh's Apostle sent Aban from Medina to Najd as the commander of a Sariya. Aban and his companions came to the Prophet at Khaibar after the Prophet had conquered it, and the reins of their horses were made of the fire of date palm trees. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do not give them a share of the booty." on, that, Aban said (to me), "Strange! You suggest such a thing though you are what you are, O guinea pig coming down from the top of Ad-Dal (a lotus tree)! "On that the Prophet said, "O Aban, sit down ! " and did not give them any share.

Narrated by Said {#5:545 .italic}

Aban bin Said came to the Prophet and greeted him. Abu Huraira said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This (Aban) is the murderer of the Ibn Qauqal." (On hearing that), Aban said to Abu Huraira, "How strange your saying is! You, a guinea pig, descending from Qadum Dan, blaming me for (killing) a person whom Alláh favored (with martyrdom) with my hand, and whom He forbade to degrade me with his hand.'

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:546 .italic}

Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Alláh's Apostle had left of the property bestowed on him by Alláh from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr said, "Alláh's Apostle said, "Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave, is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muḥammad can eat of this property.' By Alláh, I will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Alláh's Apostle and will leave it as it was during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle, and will dispose of it as Alláh's Apostle used to do." So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died. She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her husband ‘Alí, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect ‘Alí much, but after her death, ‘Alí noticed a change in the people's attitude towards him. So ‘Alí sought reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. ‘Alí had not given the oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet's death and Fatima's death). ‘Alí sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, "Come to us, but let nobody come with you," as he disliked that ‘Umar should come, ‘Umar said (to Abu Bakr), "No, by Alláh, you shall not enter upon them alone " Abu Bakr said, "What do you think they will do to me? By Alláh, I will go to them' So Abu Bakr entered upon them, and then ‘Alí uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), "We know well your superiority and what Alláh has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Alláh has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Alláh's Apostle ." Thereupon Abu Bakr's eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu Bakr spoke, he said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the relatives of Alláh's Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or regulation which I saw Alláh's Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will follow." On that ‘Alí said to Abu Bakr, "I promise to give you the oath of allegiance in this after noon." So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of ‘Alí and his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had offered; Then ‘Alí (got up) and praying (to Alláh) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud, praised Abu Bakr's right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Alláh had favored him with. ‘Alí added, "But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel sorry." On that all the Muslims became happy and said, "You have done the right thing." The Muslims then became friendly with ‘Alí as he returned to what the people had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr).

Alláh's Apostle appointed a man as the ruler of Khaibar who later brought some Janib (i.e. dates of good quality) to the Prophet. On that, Alláh's Apostle said (to him). "Are all the dates of Khaibar like this?" He said, "No, by Alláh, O Alláh's Apostle! But we take one Sa of these (dates of good quality) for two or three Sa's of other dates (of inferior quality)." On that, Alláh's Apostle said, "Do not do so, but first sell the inferior quality dates for money and then with that money, buy Janib." Abu Said and Abu Huraira said, "The Prophet made the brother of Bani Adi from the Ansar as the ruler of Khaibar.

When the Prophet went out for the 'Umra in the month of Dhal-Qa'da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote: "This is the peace treaty, which Muḥammad, Apostle of Alláh has concluded." The infidels said (to the Prophet), "We do not agree with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Alláh we would not have prevented you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muḥammad, the son of ‘Abdu’lláh." Then he said to ‘Alí, "Erase (the name of) 'Apostle of Alláh'." ‘Alí said, "No, by Alláh, I will never erase you (i.e. your name)." Then Alláh's Apostle took the writing sheet...and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got it the following written! "This is the peace treaty which Muḥammad, the son of ‘Abdu’lláh, has concluded: "Muḥammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he should not forbid him." (In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to ‘Alí and said "Tell your companion (Muḥammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished." So the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting "O Uncle, O Uncle!" ‘Alí took her by the hand and said to Fatima, "Take the daughter of your uncle." So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) ‘Alí, Zaid and Ja'far quarreled about her. ‘Alí said, "I took her for she is the daughter of my uncle." Ja'far said, "She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my wife." Zaid said, "She is the daughter of my brother." On that, the Prophet gave her to her aunt and said, "The aunt is of the same status as the mother." He then said to ‘Alí, "You are from me, and I am from you," and said to Ja'far, "You resemble me in appearance and character," and said to Zaid, "You are our brother and our freed slave." ‘Alí said to the Prophet 'Won't you marry the daughter of Hamza?" The Prophet said, "She is the daughter of my foster brother."

Alláh's Apostle set out with the intention of performing 'Umra, but the infidels of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka'ba, so the Prophet slaughtered his Hádí (i.e. sacrificing animals and shaved his head at Al-Hudaibiya and concluded a peace treaty with them (i.e. the infidels) on condition that he would perform the 'Umra the next year and that he would not carry arms against them except swords, and would not stay (in Mecca) more than what they would allow. So the Prophet performed the 'Umra in the following year and according to the peace treaty, he entered Mecca, and when he had stayed there for three days, the infidels ordered him to leave, and he left.

'Urwa and I entered the Mosque and found ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar sitting beside the dwelling place of 'Aisha. 'Urwa asked (Ibn ‘Umar), "How many 'Umras did the Prophet perform?" Ibn ‘Umar replied, "Four, one of which was in Rajab." Then we heard 'Aisha brushing her teeth whereupon 'Urwa said, "O mother of the believers! Don't you hear what Abu 'Abdur-Rahman is saying? He is saying that the Prophet performed four 'Umra, one of which was in Rajab." 'Aisha said, "The Prophet did not perform any 'Umra but he (i.e. Ibn ‘Umar) witnessed it. And he (the Prophet ) never did any 'Umra in (the month of) Rajab."

When Alláh's Apostle and his companions arrived (at Mecca), the pagans said, "There have come to you a group of people who have been weakened by the fever of Yathrib (i.e. Medina)." So the Prophet ordered his companions to do Ramal (i.e. fast walking) in the first three rounds of Tawaf around the Ka'ba and to walk in between the two corners (i.e. the black stone and the Yemenite corner). The only cause which prevented the Prophet from ordering them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf, was that he pitied them.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#5:558 .italic}

The Prophet hastened in going around the Ka'ba and between the Safa and Marwa in order to show the pagans his strength. Ibn ‘Abbás added, "When the Prophet arrived (at Mecca) in the year of peace (following that of Al-Hudaibiya treaty with the pagans of Mecca), he (ordered his companions) to do Ramal in order to show their strength to the pagans and the pagans were watching (the Muslims) from (the hill of) Quaiqan.

The Prophet had informed the people of the martyrdom of Zaid, Ja'far and Ibn Rawaha before the news of their death reached. The Prophet said, "Zaid took the flag (as the commander of the army) and was martyred, then Ja'far took it and was martyred, and then Ibn Rawaha took it and was martyred." At that time the Prophet's eyes were shedding tears. He added, "Then the flag was taken by a Sword amongst the Swords of Alláh (i.e. Khalid) and Alláh made them (i.e. the Muslims) victorious."

Narrated by 'Amra {#5:562 .italic}

I heard 'Aisha saying, "When the news of the martyrdom of Ibn Haritha, Ja'far bin Abi Talib and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaka reached, Alláh's Apostle sat with sorrow explicit on his face." 'Aisha added, "I was then peeping through a chink in the door. A man came to him and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The women of Ja'far are crying.' Thereupon the Prophet told him to forbid them to do so. So the man went away and returned saying, "I forbade them but they did not listen to me." The Prophet ordered him again to go (and forbid them). He went again and came saying, 'By Alláh, they overpowered me (i.e. did not listen to me)." 'Aisha said that Alláh's Apostle said (to him), "Go and throw dust into their mouths." Aisha added, "I said, May Alláh put your nose in the dust! By Alláh, neither have you done what you have been ordered, nor have you relieved Alláh's Apostle from trouble."

Alláh's Apostle sent us towards Al-Huruqa, and in the morning we attacked them and defeated them. I and an Ansari man followed a man from among them and when we took him over, he said, "La ilaha illal-Lah." On hearing that, the Ansari man stopped, but I killed him by stabbing him with my spear. When we returned, the Prophet came to know about that and he said, "O Usama! Did you kill him after he had said "La ilaha ilal-Lah?" I said, "But he said so only to save himself." The Prophet kept on repeating that so often that I wished I had not embraced Islam before that day.

Alláh's Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad saying, "Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh where there is a lady carrying a letter, and take that (letter) from her." So we proceeded on our way with our horses galloping till we reached the Rawda, and there we found the lady and said to her, "Take out the letter." She said, "I have no letter." We said, "Take out the letter, or else we will take off your clothes." So she took it out of her braid, and we brought the letter to Alláh's Apostle . The letter was addressed from Hatib, bin Abi Balta'a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Alláh's Apostle intended to do. Alláh's Apostle said, "O Hatib! What is this?" Hatib replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraish but I was an ally to them from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the Emigrants who were with you, have got their kinsmen (in Mecca) who can protect their families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor so that they might protect my relatives as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this to renegade from my religion (i.e. Islam) nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam." Alláh's Apostle said to his companions." As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you the truth." ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite!" The Prophet said, "He (i.e. Hatib) has witnessed the Badr battle (i.e. fought in it) and what could tell you, perhaps Alláh looked at those who witnessed Badr and said, "O the people of Badr (i.e. Badr Muslim warriors), do what you like, for I have forgiven you. "Then Alláh revealed the Sura:-- "O you who believe! Take not my enemies And your enemies as friends offering them (Your) love even though they have disbelieved in that Truth (i.e. Alláh, Prophet Muḥammad and this Qur’án) which has come to you ....(to the end of Verse)....(And whosoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far) astray (away) from the Straight Path."

Behold! There they saw many fires as if they were the fires of Arafat. Abu Sufyan said, "What is this? It looked like the fires of Arafat." Budail bin Warqa' said, "Banu 'Amr are less in number than that." Some of the guards of Alláh's Apostle saw them and took them over, caught them and brought them to Alláh's Apostle. Abu Sufyan embraced Islam. When the Prophet proceeded, he said to Al-‘Abbás, "Keep Abu Sufyan standing at the top of the mountain so that he would look at the Muslims. So Al-‘Abbás kept him standing (at that place) and the tribes with the Prophet started passing in front of Abu Sufyan in military batches. A batch passed and Abu Sufyan said, "O ‘Abbás Who are these?" ‘Abbás said, "They are (Banu) Ghifar." Abu Sufyan said, I have got nothing to do with Ghifar."

Then came a batch, the like of which Abu Sufyan had not seen. He said, "Who are these?" ‘Abbás said, "They are the Ansar headed by Sad bin Ubada, the one holding the flag." Sad bin Ubada said, "O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day of a great battle and today (what is prohibited in) the Ka'ba will be permissible." Abu Sufyan said., "O ‘Abbás! How excellent the day of destruction is! "Then came another batch (of warriors) which was the smallest of all the batches, and in it there was Alláh's Apostle and his companions and the flag of the Prophet was carried by Az-Zubair bin Al Awwam. When Alláh's Apostle passed by Abu Sufyan, the latter said, (to the Prophet), "Do you know what Sad bin 'Ubada said?" The Prophet said, "What did he say?" Abu Sufyan said, "He said so-and-so." The Prophet said, "Sad told a lie, but today Alláh will give superiority to the Ka'ba and today the Ka'ba will be covered with a (cloth) covering." Alláh's Apostle ordered that his flag be fixed at Al-Hajun. Narrated 'Urwa: Nafi bin Jubair bin Mut'im said, "I heard Al-‘Abbás saying to Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, 'O Abu ‘Abdu’lláh ! Did Alláh's Apostle order you to fix the flag here?' " Alláh's Apostle ordered Khalid bin Al-Walid to enter Mecca from its upper part from Ka'da while the Prophet himself entered from Kuda.

'So celebrate the Praises Of your Lord and ask for His forgiveness, Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance and forgives." (110.1-3) Some of them replied, "We are ordered to praise Alláh and repent to Him if we are helped and granted victory." Some said, "We do not know." Others kept quiet. ‘Umar then said to me, "Do you say similarly?" I said, "No." ‘Umar said "What do you say then?" I said, "This Verse indicates the approaching of the death of Alláh's Apostle of which Alláh informed him. When comes the help of Alláh and the Conquest, i.e. the Conquest of Mecca, that will be the sign of your Prophet's) approaching death, so testify the uniqueness of your Lord (i.e. Alláh) and praise Him and repent to Him as He is ready to forgive."

Allow me to tell you a statement which Alláh's Apostle said on the second day of the Conquest of Mecca. My two ears heard it and my heart remembered it and my two eyes saw him when he said it. He (i.e. the Prophet) praised Alláh and then said, 'Mecca has been made a sanctuary by Alláh and not by the people, so it is not lawful for a person, who believes in Alláh and the Last Day to shed blood in it, or to cut its trees and if someone asks the permission to fight in Mecca because Alláh's Apostle was allowed to fight in it, say to him; Alláh permitted His Apostle and did not allow you, and even he (i.e. the Apostle) was allowed for a short period of the day, and today its (Mecca's sanctity has become the same as it was before (of old) so those who are present should inform those who are absent (this Ḥadít_h)." Then Abu Shuraih, was asked, "What did 'Amr say to you? Abu Shuraih said, "He said, "I knew that better than you, O Abu Shuraih!

We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people, and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, "What is wrong with the people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, "That man claims that Alláh has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that Alláh has revealed to him such-and-such." I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the 'Arabs (other than Quraish) delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say." "Leave him (i.e. Muḥammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, "By Alláh, I have come to you from the Prophet for sure!" The Prophet afterwards said to them, 'Offer such-and-such prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows Qur’án most should, lead the prayer." So they looked for such a person and found none who knew more Qur’án than I because of the Qur’ánic material which I used to learn from the caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, "Won't you cover the anus of your reciter for us?" So they bought (a piece of cloth) and made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that shirt.

This is my brother who is the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and was born on his (i.e. Zam'as) bed.' Alláh's Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam'a and noticed that he, of all the people had the greatest resemblance to 'Utba bin Abi Waqqas. Alláh's Apostle then said (to 'Abd), " He is yours; he is your brother, O 'Abd bin Zam'a, he was born on the bed (of your father)." (At the same time) Alláh's Apostle said (to his wife Sauda), "Veil yourself before him (i.e. the son of the slave-girl) O Sauda," because of the resemblance he noticed between him and Utba bin Abi Waqqas. Alláh's Apostle added, "The boy is for the bed (i.e. for the owner of the bed where he was born), and stone is for the adulterer."

When Usama interceded for her with Alláh's Apostle, the color of the face of Alláh's Apostle changed and he said, "Do you intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by Alláh?" Usama said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Ask Alláh's Forgiveness for me." So in the afternoon, Alláh's Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Alláh as He deserved and then said, "Amma ba'du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would apply (Alláh's) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muḥammad's soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muḥammad stole, I would cut her hand." Then Alláh's Apostle gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off. Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. 'Aisha said, "That lady used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Alláh's Apostle."

I said to the Prophet, "For what will you take his pledge of allegiance?" The Prophet said, "I will take his pledge of allegiance for Islam, Belief, and for Jihad (i.e. fighting in Alláh's Cause)"

It (i.e. fighting in it) was not made lawful to anyone before me!, nor will it be made lawful to anyone after me, and it was not made lawful for me except for a short period of time. Its game should not be chased, nor should its trees be cut, nor its vegetation or grass uprooted, not its Luqata (i.e. Most things) picked up except by one who makes a public announcement about it." Al-‘Abbás bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib said, "Except the Idhkhir, O Alláh's Apostle, as it is indispensable for blacksmiths and houses."

Narrated by Marwan and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama {#5:608 .italic}

When the delegate of Hawazin came to Alláh's Apostle declaring their conversion to Islam and asked him to return their properties and captives, Alláh's Apostle got up and said to them, "There Is involved in this matter, the people whom you see with me, and the most beloved talk to me, is the true one. So choose one of two alternatives: Either the captives or the properties. I have been waiting for you (i.e. have not distributed the booty)." Alláh's Apostle had delayed the distribution of their booty over ten nights after his return from Ta'if. So when they came to know that Alláh's Apostle was not going to return to them but one of the two, they said, "We prefer to have our captives." So Alláh's Apostle got up amongst the Muslims, and praising Alláh as He deserved, said, "To proceed! Your brothers have come to you with repentance and I see (it logical) to return their captives. So, whoever of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it. And whoever of you likes to stick to his share till we give him from the very first booty which Alláh will give us, then he can do so." The people said, "We do that (i.e. return the captives) willingly as a favor, 'O Alláh's Apostle!" Alláh's Apostle said, "We do not know which of you have agreed to it and which have not; so go back and let your chiefs forward us your decision." They went back and their chief's spoke to them, and they (i.e. the chiefs) returned to Alláh's Apostle and informed him that all of them had agreed (to give up their captives) with pleasure, and had given their permission (i.e. that the captives be returned to their people). (The sub-narrator said, "That is what has reached me about the captives of Hawazin tribe.")

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:609 .italic}

When we returned from (the battle of) Hunain, ‘Umar asked the Prophet about a vow which he had made during the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance that he would perform Itikaf. The Prophet ordered him to fulfill his vow.

Narrated by Abu Qatada {#5:610 .italic}

We set out along with the Prophet during the year of (the battle of) Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception of the Prophet and some of his companions) retreated (before the enemy). I saw one of the pagans over-powering one of the Muslims, so I struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his armor to be cut off. The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. Afterwards I followed ‘Umar and said to him, "What is wrong with the people?" He said, "It is the Order of Alláh." Then the Muslims returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after overcoming the enemy) the Prophet sat and said, "Whoever had killed an Infidel and has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging of the deceased e.g. clothes, arms, horse, etc)." I (stood up) and said, "Who will be my witness?" and then sat down. Then the Prophet repeated his question. Then the Prophet said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, "Who will be my witness?" and then sat down. The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?" So I narrated the whole story; A man said, "Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf." Abu Bakr said, "No! By Alláh, it will never happen that the Prophet will leave a Lion of Alláh who fights for the Sake of Alláh and His Apostle and give his spoils to you." The Prophet said, "Abu Bakr has spoken the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!" So he gave it to me and I bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the first property I got after embracing Islam.

Narrated by Abu Qatada {#5:611 .italic}

When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off. That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with them. Suddenly I met ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, "What is wrong with the people?" He said, "It is the order of Alláh" Then the people returned to Alláh's Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the killed man." So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Alláh's Apostle. A man from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, "The arms of the deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate him for it (i.e. the spoils)," Abu Bakr said, "No, Alláh's Apostle will not give it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Alláh's Lions who fights on behalf of Alláh and His Apostle." Alláh's Apostle then got up and gave that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got after embracing Islam.

Narrated by Abu Musa {#5:612 .italic}

When the Prophet had finished from the battle of Hunain, he sent Abu Amir at the head of an army to Autas He (i.e. Abu Amir) met Duraid bin As Summa and Duraid was killed and Alláh defeated his companions. The Prophet sent me with Abu 'Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, "O Uncle! Who shot you?" He pointed me out (his killer) saying, "That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow)." So I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and started saying to him, "Won't you be ashamed? Won't you stop?" So that person stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu 'Amir. "Alláh has killed your killer." He said, "Take out this arrow" So I removed it, and water oozed out of the wound. He then said, "O son of my brother! Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Alláh's Forgiveness for me." Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He survived for a short while and then died. (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet at his house, and found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted with ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had their traces over his back and sides. Then I told the Prophet about our and Abu Amir's news and how he had said "Tell him to ask for Alláh's Forgiveness for me." The Prophet asked for water, performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, "O Alláh's Forgive 'Ubaid, Abu Amir." At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet's armpits. The Prophet then said, "O Alláh, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of Resurrection, superior to many of Your human creatures." I said, "Will you ask Alláh's Forgiveness for me?" (On that) the Prophet said, "O Alláh, forgive the sins of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais and admit him to a nice entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection." Abu Burda said, "One of the prayers was for Abu 'Amir and the other was for Abu Musa (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais)."

Narrated by Um Salama {#5:613 .italic}

The Prophet came to me while there was an effeminate man sitting with me, and I heard him (i.e. the effeminate man) saying to ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Umaiya, "O ‘Abdu’lláh! See if Alláh should make you conquer Ta'if tomorrow, then take the daughter of Ghailan (in marriage) as (she is so beautiful and fat that) she shows four folds of flesh when facing you, and eight when she turns her back." The Prophet then said, "These (effeminate men) should never enter upon you (O women!)." Ibn Juraij said, "That effeminate man was called Hit."

Narrated by Hisham {#5:614 .italic}

The above narration and added extra, that at that time, the Prophet, was besieging Taif.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Amr {#5:615 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle besieged Taif and could not conquer its people, he said, "We will return (to Medina) If Alláh wills." That distressed the Companions (of the Prophet and they said, "Shall we go away without conquering it (i.e. the Fort of Taif)?" Once the Prophet said, "Let us return." Then the Prophet said (to them), "Fight tomorrow." They fought and (many of them) got wounded, whereupon the Prophet said, "We will return (to Medina) tomorrow if Alláh wills." That delighted them, whereupon the Prophet smiled. The sub-narrator, Sufyan said once, "(The Prophet) smiled."

Narrated by Abu Uthman {#5:616 .italic}

I heard from Sad, the first man who has thrown an arrow in Alláh's Cause, and from Abu Bakra who jumped over the wall of the Ta'if Fort along with a few persons and came to the Prophet. They both said, "We heard the Prophet saying, " If somebody claims to be the son of somebody other than his father knowingly, he will be denied Paradise (i.e. he will not enter Paradise).' " Narrated Ma'mar from 'Asim from Abu Al'Aliya or Abu Uthman An-Nahdi who said. "I heard Sad and Abu Bakra narrating from the Prophet." 'Asim said, "I said (to him), 'Very trustworthy persons have narrated to you.' He said, 'Yes, one of them was the first to throw an arrow in Alláh's Cause and the other came to the Prophet in a group of thirty-three persons from Ta'if.'

Narrated by Abu Burda {#5:617 .italic}

Abu Musa said, "I was with the Prophet when he was encamping at Al-Jarana (a place) between Mecca and Medina and Bilal was with him. A bedouin came to the Prophet and said, "Won't you fulfill what you have promised me?" The Prophet said, 'Rejoice (at what I will do for you).' The bedouin said, "(You have said to me) rejoice too often." Then the Prophet turned to me (i.e. Abu Musa) and Bilal in an angry mood and said, 'The bedouin has refused the good tidings, so you both accept them.' Bilal and I said, 'We accept them.' Then the Prophet asked for a drinking bowl containing water and washed his hands and face in it, and then took a mouthful of water and threw it therein saying (to us), "Drink (some of) it and pour (some) over your faces and chests and be happy at the good tidings." So they both took the drinking bowl and did as instructed. Um Salama called from behind a screen, "Keep something (of the water for your mother." So they left some of it for her.

Narrated by Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya {#5:618 .italic}

Ya'la used to say, "I wish I could see Alláh's Apostle at the time when he is being inspired divinely." Ya'la added "While the Prophet was at Al-Ja'rana, shaded with a cloth sheet (in the form of a tent) and there were staying with him, some of his companions under it, suddenly there came to him a bedouin wearing a cloak and perfumed extravagantly. He said, "O Alláh's Apostle ! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes the state of Ihram for 'Umra wearing a cloak after applying perfume to his body?" ‘Umar signalled with his hand to Ya'la to come (near). Ya'la came and put his head (underneath that cloth sheet) and saw the Prophet red-faced and when that state (of the Prophet ) was over, he said, "Where is he who as already asked me about the 'Umra?" The man was looked for and brought to the Prophet The Prophet said (to him), "As for the perfume you have applied to your body, wash it off your body) thrice, and take off your cloak, and then do in your 'Umra the rites you do in your Hajj."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Zaid bin Asim {#5:619 .italic}

When Alláh gave to His Apostle the war booty on the day of Hunain, he distributed that booty amongst those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Islam), but did not give anything to the Ansar. So they seemed to have felt angry and sad as they did not get the same as other people had got. The Prophet then delivered a sermon before them, saying, "O, the assembly of Ansar! Didn't I find you astray, and then Alláh guided you on the Right Path through me? You were divided into groups, and Alláh brought you together through me; you were poor and Alláh made you rich through me." Whatever the Prophet said , they (i.e. the Ansar) said, "Alláh and his Apostle have more favours to do." The Prophet said, "What stops you from answering the Apostle of Alláh?" But whatever he said to them, they replied, "Alláh and His Apostle have more favours to do." The Prophet then said, "If you wish you could say: 'You came to us in such-and-such state (at Medina).' Wouldn't you be willing to see the people go away with sheep and camels while you go with the Prophet to your homes? But for the migration, I would have been one of the Ansar, and if the people took their way through a valley or mountain pass, I would select the valley or mountain pass of the Ansar. The Ansar are Shiar (i.e. those clothes which are in direct contact with the body and worn inside the other garments), and the people are Dithar (i.e. those clothes which are not in direct contact with the body and are worn over other garments). No doubt, you will see other people favoured over you, so you should be patient till you meet me at the Tank (of Kauthar).

Narrated by Anas Bin Malik {#5:620 .italic}

When Alláh gave Alláh's Apostle what he gave of the properties of the Hawazin tribe as a war booty, the Prophet started giving some men 100 camels each. The Ansar (then) said, "May Alláh forgive Alláh's Apostles as he gives to Quraish and leaves us although our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish." Alláh Apostle was informed of their statement, so he sent for the Ansar and gathered them in a leather tent, and did not call anybody else along with them. When they al I gathered, the Prophet got up and said, "What is this talk being informed to me about you?" The learned men amongst the Ansar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Our chiefs did not say anything, but some people amongst us who are younger in age said. 'May Alláh forgive Alláh's Apostle as he gives (of the booty) to Quraish and leaves us though our swords are still dribbling with their blood." The Prophet said, "I give to these men who have newly deserted heathenism (and embraced Islam) so as to attract their hearts. Won't you be happy that the people take the wealth while you take the Prophet with you to your homes? By Alláh, what you are taking is better than whatever they are taking." They (i.e. the Ansar) said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We are satisfied." The Prophet then said to them. "You will find others favored over you greatly, so be patient till you meet Alláh and His Apostle and I will be at the Tank then." Anas added: But they did not remain patient.

Narrated by Anas {#5:621 .italic}

When it was the day of the Conquest (of Mecca) Alláh's Apostle distributed the war booty amongst the people of Quraish which caused the Ansar to become angry. So the Prophet said, "Won't you be pleased that the people take the worldly things and you take Alláh's Apostle with you? "They said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "If the people took their way through a valley or mountain pass, I would take my way through the Ansar's valley or mountain pass."

Narrated by Anas {#5:622 .italic}

When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, the Prophet confronted the tribe of Hawazin while there were ten-thousand (men) besides the Tulaqa' (i.e. those who had embraced Islam on the day of the Conquest of Mecca) with the Prophet. When they (i.e. Muslims) fled, the Prophet said, "O the group of Ansari" They replied, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle and Sadaik! We are under your command." Then the Prophet got down (from his mule) and said, "I am Alláh's Slave and His Apostle." Then the pagans were defeated. The Prophet distributed the war booty amongst the Tulaqa and Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) and did not give anything to the Ansar. So the Ansar spoke (i.e. were dissatisfied) and he called them and made them enter a leather tent and said, Won't you be pleased that the people take the sheep and camels, and you take Alláh's Apostle along with you?" The Prophet added, "If the people took their way through a valley and the Ansar took their way through a mountain pass, then I would choose a mountain pass of the Ansar"

Narrated by Anas {#5:623 .italic}

The Prophet gathered some people of Ansar and said, "The People of Quraish are still close to their Pre-lslamic period of ignorance and have suffered a lot, and I want to help them and attract their hearts (by giving them the war booty). Won't you be pleased that the people take the worldly things) and you take Alláh's Apostle with you to your homes?" They said, "Yes, (i.e. we are pleased with this distribution)." The Prophet said, "'If the people took their way through a valley and the Ansar took their way through a mountain pass, then I would take the Ansar's valley or the Ansar's mountain pass."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:624 .italic}

When the Prophet distribute the war booty of Hunain, a man from the Ansar said, "He (i.e. the Prophet), did not intend to please Alláh in this distribution." So I came to the Prophet and informed him of that (statement) whereupon the color of his face changed and he said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on Moses, for he was troubled with more than this, but he remained patient."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:625 .italic}

When it was the day of Hunain, Prophet favored some people over some others (in the distribution of the booty). He gave Al-Aqra' one-hundred camels and gave Uyaina the same, and also gave other people (of Quraish). A man said, "Alláh's Pleasure was not the aim, in this distribution." I said, "I will inform the Prophet (about your statement)." The Prophet said, "May Alláh bestow Mercy on Moses, for he was troubled more this but he remained patient."

Narrated by Anas Bin Malik {#5:626 .italic}

When it was the day (of the battle) of Hunain, the tributes of Hawazin and Ghatafan and others, along with their animals and offspring (and wives) came to fight against the Prophet The Prophet had with him, ten thousand men and some of the Tulaqa. The companions fled, leaving the Prophet alone. The Prophet then made two calls which were clearly distinguished from each other. He turned right and said, "O the group of Ansar!" They said, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle! Rejoice, for we are with you!" Then he turned left and said, "O the group of Ansar!" They said, "Labbaik! O Alláh's Apostle! Rejoice, for we are with you!" The Prophet at that time, was riding on a white mule; then he dismounted and said, "I am Alláh's Slave and His Apostle." The infidels then were defeated, and on that day the Prophet gained a large amount of booty which he distributed amongst the Muhajirin and the Tulaqa and did not give anything to the Ansar. The Ansar said, "When there is a difficulty, we are called, but the booty is given to other than us." The news reached the Prophet and he gathered them in a leather tent and said, "What is this news reaching me from you, O the group of Ansar?" They kept silent, He added," O the group of Ansar! Won't you be happy that the people take the worldly things and you take Alláh's Apostle to your homes reserving him for yourself?" They said, "Yes." Then the Prophet said, "If the people took their way through a valley, and the Ansar took their way through a mountain pass, surely, I would take the Ansar's mountain pass." Hisham said, "O Abu Hamza (i.e. Anas)! Did you witness that? " He replied, "And how could I be absent from him?"

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:627 .italic}

The Prophet sent a Sariya towards Najd and I was in it, and our share from the booty amounted to twelve camels each, and we were given an additional camel each. So we returned with thirteen camels each.

The Prophet sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the tribe of Jadhima and Khalid invited them to Islam but they could not express themselves by saying, "Aslamna (i.e. we have embraced Islam)," but they started saying "Saba'na! Saba'na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another)." Khalid kept on killing (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive. When there came the day then Khalid ordered that each man (i.e. Muslim soldier) should kill his captive, I said, "By Alláh, I will not kill my captive, and none of my companions will kill his captive." When we reached the Prophet, we mentioned to him the whole story. On that, the Prophet raised both his hands and said twice, "O Alláh! I am free from what Khalid has done."

Narrated by ‘Alí {#5:629 .italic}

The Prophet sent a Sariya under the command of a man from the Ansar and ordered the soldiers to obey him. He (i.e. the commander) became angry and said "Didn't the Prophet order you to obey me!" They replied, "Yes." He said, "Collect fire-wood for me." So they collected it. He said, "Make a fire." When they made it, he said, "Enter it (i.e. the fire)." So they intended to do that and started holding each other and saying, "We run towards (i.e. take refuge with) the Prophet from the fire." They kept on saying that till the fire was extinguished and the anger of the commander abated. When that news reached the Prophet he said, "If they had entered it (i.e. the fire), they would not have come out of it till the Day of Resurrection. Obedience (to somebody) is required when he enjoins what is good."

Narrated by Abu Burda {#5:630 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent Abu Musa and Muadh bin Jabal to Yemen. He sent each of them to administer a province as Yemen consisted of two provinces. The Prophet said (to them), "Facilitate things for the people and do not make things difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once Mu'adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his companion Abu Musa. Mu'adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his hands behind his neck. Mu'adh said to Abu Musa, "O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais! What is this?" Abu Musa replied. "This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam." Mu'adh said, "I will not dismount till he is killed." Abu Musa replied, "He has been brought for this purpose, so come down." Mu'adh said, "I will not dismount till he is killed." So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed, and he was killed. Then Mu'adh dismounted and said, "O ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Qais)! How do you recite the Qur’án ?" Abu Musa said, "I recite the Qur’án regularly at intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu'adh?" Mu'adh said, "I sleep in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for my sleep and then recite as much as Alláh has written for me. So I seek Alláh's Reward for both my sleep as well as my prayer (at night)."

Abu Musa said, "O Alláh's Prophet! In our land there is an alcoholic drink (prepared) from barley called Al-Mizr, and another (prepared) from honey, called Al-Bit"' The Prophet said, "All intoxicants are prohibited." Then both of them proceeded and Mu'adh asked Abu Musa, "How do you recite the Qur’án?" Abu Musa replied, "I recite it while I am standing, sitting or riding my riding animals, at intervals and piecemeal." Muadh said, "But I sleep and then get up. I sleep and hope for Alláh's Reward for my sleep as I seek His Reward for my night prayer." Then he (i.e. Muadh) pitched a tent and they started visiting each other. Once Muadh paid a visit to Abu Musa and saw a chained man. Muadh asked, "What is this?" Abu Musa said, "(He was) a Jew who embraced Islam and has now turned apostate." Muadh said, "I will surely chop off his neck!"

The Prophet said, "Have you made the intention to perform the Hajj, O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais?" I replied, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "What did you say?" I replied, "I said, 'Labbaik' and expressed the same intention as yours." He said, "Have you driven the Hádí along with you?" I replied, "No, I did not drive the Hádí." He said, "So perform the Tawaf of the Ka'ba and then the Sai, between Safa and Marwa and then finish the state of Ihram." So I did the same, and one of the women of (the tribe of) Banu-Qais combed my hair. We continued follow in that tradition till the caliphate of ‘Umar.

Alláh's Apostle said to Muadh bin Jabal when he sent him to Yemen. "You will come to the people of Scripture, and when you reach them, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Alláh and that Muḥammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, then tell them that Alláh has enjoined on them five prayers to be performed every day and night. And if they obey you in that, then tell them that Alláh has enjoined on them Sadaqa (i.e. Rakat) to be taken from the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them. And if they obey you in that, then be cautious! Don't take their best properties (as Zakat) and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person as there is no screen between his invocation and Alláh.

The Prophet said to ‘Alí, "Give Khalid's companions the choice of either staying with you (in Yemen) or returning to Medina." I was one of those who stayed with him (i.e. ‘Alí) and got several Awaq (of gold from the war booty.

The Prophet sent ‘Alí to Khalid to bring the Khumus (of the booty) and I hated ‘Alí, and ‘Alí had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave-girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, "Don't you see this (i.e. ‘Alí)?" When we reached the Prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, "O Buraida! Do you hate ‘Alí?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Do you hate him, for he deserves more than that from the Khumlus."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#5:638 .italic}

‘Alí bin Abi Talib sent a piece of gold not yet taken out of its ore, in a tanned leather container to Alláh's Apostle . Alláh's Apostle distributed that amongst four Persons: 'Uyaina bin Badr, Aqra bin Habis, Zaid Al-Khail and the fourth was either Alqama or Amir bin At Tufail. On that, one of his companions said, "We are more deserving of this (gold) than these (persons)." When that news reached the Prophet , he said, "Don't you trust me though I am the truth worthy man of the One in the Heavens, and I receive the news of Heaven (i.e. Divine Inspiration) both in the morning and in the evening?" There got up a man with sunken eyes, raised cheek bones, raised forehead, a thick beard, a shaven head and a waist sheet that was tucked up and he said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Be afraid of Alláh." The Prophet said, "Woe to you! Am I not of all the people of the earth the most entitled to fear Alláh?" Then that man went away. Khalid bin Al-Wahd said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall I chop his neck off?" The Prophet said, "No, for he may offer prayers." Khalid said, "Numerous are those who offer prayers and say by their tongues (i.e. mouths) what is not in their hearts." Alláh's Apostle said, "I have not been ordered (by Alláh) to search the hearts of the people or cut open their bellies." Then the Prophet looked at him (i.e. that man) while the latter was going away and said, "From the offspring of this (man there will come out (people) who will recite the Qur’án continuously and elegantly but it will not exceed their throats. (They will neither understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e. Islam) as an arrow goes through a game's body." I think he also said, "If I should be present at their time I would kill them as the nations a Thamud were killed."

In the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance there was a house called Dhu-l-Khalasa or Al-Ka'ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka'ba Ash-Shamiya. The Prophet said to me, "Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?" So I set out with one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there. Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas (tribe).

Narrated by Qais {#5:642 .italic}

Jarir said to me, The Prophet said to me, "Won't you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?" And that was a house (in Yemem belonging to the tribe of) Khatham called Al-Kaba Al Yamaniya. I proceeded with one-hundred and-fifty cavalry from Ahmas (tribe) who were horse riders. I used not to sit firm on horses, so the Prophet stroke me over my chest till I saw the mark of his fingers over my chest, and then he said, 'O Alláh! Make him (i.e. Jarir) firm and one who guides others and is guided on the right path." So Jarir proceeded to it dismantled and burnt it, and then sent a messenger to Alláh's Apostle. The messenger of Jarir said (to the Prophet), "By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave that place till it was like a scabby camel." The Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times.

Narrated by Qais {#5:643 .italic}

Jarir said "Alláh's Apostle said to me, "Won't you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?" I replied, "Yes, (I will relieve you)." So I proceeded along with one-hundred and fifty cavalry from Ahmas tribe who were skillful in riding horses. I used not to sit firm over horses, so I informed the Prophet of that, and he stroke my chest with his hand till I saw the marks of his hand over my chest and he said, O Alláh! Make him firm and one who guides others and is guided (on the right path).' Since then I have never fallen from a horse. Dhul-l--Khulasa was a house in Yemen belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka'ba." Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and dismantled it. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. "The messenger of Alláh's Apostle is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your neck." One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped there and said to him, "Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, or else I will chop off your neck." So the man broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Alláh. Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he said, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave it till it was like a scabby camel." Then the Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times.

Narrated by Abu Uthman {#5:644 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent 'Amr bin Al As as the commander of the troops of Dhat-us-Salasil. 'Amr bin Al-'As said, "(On my return) I came to the Prophet and said, 'Which people do you love most?' He replied, 'Aisha.' I said, 'From amongst the men?' He replied, 'Her father (Abu Bakr)'. I said, 'Whom (do you love) next?' He replied, "‘Umar.' Then he counted the names of many men, and I became silent for fear that he might regard me as the last of them."

Narrated by Jarir {#5:645 .italic}

While I was at Yemen, I met two men from Yemen called Dhu Kala and Dhu Amr, and I started telling them about Alláh's Apostle. Dhu Amr said to me, "If what you are saying about your friend (i.e. the Prophet) is true, then he has died three days ago." Then both of them accompanied me to Medina, and when we had covered some distance on the way to Medina, we saw some riders coming from Medina. We asked them and they said, "Alláh's Apostle has died and Abu Bakr has been appointed as the Caliph and the people are in a good state.' Then they said, "Tell your friend (Abu Bakr) that we have come (to visit him), and if Alláh will, we will come again." So they both returned to Yemen. When I told Abu Bakr their statement, he said to me, "I wish you had brought them (to me)." Afterwards I met Dhu Amr, and he said to me, "O Jarir! You have done a favor to me and I am going to tell you something, i.e. you, the nation of 'Arabs, will remain prosperous as long as you choose and appoint another chief whenever a former one is dead. But if authority is obtained by the power of the sword, then the rulers will become kings who will get angry, as kings get angry, and will be delighted as kings get delighted."

Narrated by Wahab bin Kaisan {#5:646 .italic}

Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh said, "Alláh's Apostle sent troops to the sea coast and appointed Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their commander, and they were 300 (men). We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food ran short. So Abu 'Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected, and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that we did not receive except a date each." I asked (Jabir), "How could one date benefit you?" He said, "We came to know its value when even that finished." Jabir added, "Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu 'Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching them."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#5:647 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent us who were three-hundred riders under the command of Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah in order to watch the caravan of the Quraish pagans. We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal (i.e. a fish) called Al-'Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and healthy). Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, "He took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from underneath it (without touching it). " Jabir added: There was a man amongst the people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu 'Ubaida forbade him to do so. Narrated Abu Salih: Qais bin Sad said to his father. "I was present in the army and the people were struck with severe hunger." He said, "You should have slaughtered (camels) (for them)." Qais said, "I did slaughter camels but they were hungry again. He said, "You should have slaughtered (camels) again." Qais said, "I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt hungry again." He said, "You should have slaughtered (camels) again." Qais said, "I did slaughter (camels) again, but the people again felt hungry." He said, "You should have slaughtered (camels) again." Qais said, "But I was forbidden (by Abu 'Ubaida this time)."

Narrated by Jabir {#5:648 .italic}

We set out in the army of Al-Khabt and Abu Ubaida was the commander of the troops. We were struck with severe hunger and the sea threw out a dead fish the like of which we had never seen, and it was called Al-'Anbar. We ate of it for half a month. Abu Ubaida took (and fixed) one of its bones and a rider passed underneath it (without touching it). (Jabir added:) Abu 'Ubaida said (to us), "Eat (of that fish)." When we arrived at Medina, we informed the Prophet about that, and he said, "Eat, for it is food Alláh has brought out for you, and feed us if you have some of it." So some of them gave him (of that fish) and he ate it.

A delegation from Banu Tamim came to the Prophet . The Prophet said, "Accept the good tidings, O Banu Tamim!" They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You have given us good tidings, so give us (something)." Signs of displeasure appeared on his face. Then another delegation from Yemen came and he said (to them), "Accept the good tidings, for Banu Tamim refuses to accept them." They replied, "We have accepted them, O Alláh's Apostle!"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:652 .italic}

I have not ceased to like Banu Tamim ever since I heard of three qualities attributed to them by Alláh's Apostle (He said): They, out of all my followers, will be the strongest opponent of Ad-Dajjal; 'Aisha had a slave-girl from them, and the Prophet told her to manumit her as she was from the descendants of (the Prophet) Ishmael; and, when their Zakat was brought, the Prophet said, "This is the Zakat of my people."

‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair said that a group of riders belonging to Banu Tamim came to the Prophet, Abu Bakr said (to the Prophet ), "Appoint Al-Qa'qa bin Mabad bin Zurara as (their) ruler." ‘Umar said (to the Prophet). "No! But appoint Al-Aqra bin Habis." Thereupon Abu Bakr said (to ‘Umar). "You just wanted to oppose me." ‘Umar replied. "I did not want to oppose you." So both of them argued so much that their voices became louder, and then the following Divine Verses were revealed in that connection: "O you who believe ! Do not be forward in the presence of Alláh and His Apostle..." (till the end of Verse)...(49.1)

I said to Ibn ‘Abbás, "I have an earthenware pot containing Nabidh (i.e. water and dates or grapes) for me, and I drink of it while it is sweet. If I drink much of it and stay with the people for a long time, I get afraid that they may discover it (for I will appear as if I were drunk). Ibn ‘Abbás said, "A delegation of ‘Abdu’l- Qais came to Alláh's Apostle and he said, "Welcome, O people! Neither will you have disgrace nor will you regret." They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! There are the Mudar pagans between you and us, so we cannot come to you except in the sacred Months. So please teach us some orders on acting upon which we will enter Paradise. Besides, we will preach that to our people who are behind us." The Prophet said, "I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things (I order you): To believe in Alláh...Do you know what is to believe in Alláh? That is to testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh: (I order you also to offer prayers perfectly to pay Zakat; and to fast the month of Ramaḍán and to give the Khumus (i.e. one-fifth of the booty) (for Alláh's Sake). I forbid you from four other things (i.e. the wine that is prepared in) Ad-Dubba, An-Naquir, Az-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat. (See Ḥadít_h No. 50 Vol. 1)

The delegation of ‘Abdu’l- Qais came to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle We belong to the tribe of Rabia. The infidels of Mudar tribe intervened between us and you so that we cannot come to you except in the Sacred Months, so please order us some things we may act on and invite those left behind to act on. The Prophet said, "I order you to observe four things and forbid you from four things: (I order you) to believe in Alláh, i.e. to testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh." The Prophet pointed with finger indicating one and added, "To offer prayers perfectly: to give Zakat, and to give one-fifth of the booty you win (for Alláh's Sake). I forbid you to use Ad-Dubba', An-Naquir, Al-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat, (Utensils used for preparing alcoholic liquors and drinks)

That Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbás told him that Ibn ‘Abbás, 'Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama sent him to 'Aisha saying, "Pay her our greetings and ask her about our offering of the two-Rak'at after 'Asr Prayer, and tell her that we have been informed that you offer these two Rakat while we have heard that the Prophet had forbidden their offering." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "I and ‘Umar used to beat the people for their offering them." Kuraib added, "I entered upon her and delivered their message to her.' She said, 'Ask Um Salama.' So, I informed them (of 'Aisha's answer) and they sent me to Um Salama for the same purpose as they sent me to 'Aisha. Um Salama replied, 'I heard the Prophet forbidding the offering of these two Rakat. Once the Prophet offered the 'Asr prayer, and then came to me. And at that time some Ansari women from the Tribe of Banu Haram were with me. Then (the Prophet ) offered those two Rakat, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, 'Stand beside him and say (to him): Um Salama says, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Didn't I hear you forbidding the offering of these two Rakat (after the Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?' And if he beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.' So the lady slave did that and the Prophet beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet finished his prayer, he said, 'O the daughter of Abu Umaiya (i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me about these two Rakat after the 'Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of ‘Abdu’l- Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two Rakat which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two Rakat (you have seen me offering) make up for those."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:658 .italic}

The Prophet sent some cavalry towards Najd and they brought a man from the tribe of Banu Hanifa who was called Thumama bin Uthal. They fastened him to one of the pillars of the Mosque. The Prophet went to him and said, "What have you got, O Thumama?" He replied," I have got a good thought, O Muḥammad! If you should kill me, you would kill a person who has already killed somebody, and if you should set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful, and if you want property, then ask me whatever wealth you want." He was left till the next day when the Prophet said to him, "What have you got, Thumama? He said, "What I told you, i.e. if you set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful." The Prophet left him till the day after, when he said, "What have you got, O Thumama?" He said, "I have got what I told you. "On that the Prophet said, "Release Thumama." So he (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and then entered the Mosque and said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, and also testify that Muḥammad is His Apostle! By Alláh, O Muḥammad! There was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face has become the most beloved face to me. By Alláh, there was no religion most disliked by me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Alláh, there was no town most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the 'Umra. And now what do you think?" The Prophet gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him to perform the 'Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, "You have become a Sabian?" Thumama replied, "No! By Alláh, I have embraced Islam with Muḥammad, Apostle of Alláh. No, by Alláh! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Jamaica unless the Prophet gives his permission."

Musailima Al-Kadhdhab came during the lifetime of the Prophet and started saying, "If Muḥammad gives me the rule after him, I will follow him." And he came to Medina with a great number of the people of his tribe. Alláh's Apostle went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time, Alláh's Apostle had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet ) stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him, "If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Alláh's Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this religion, then Alláh will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my behalf." Then the Prophet went away from him. I asked about the statement of Alláh's Apostle : "You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream," and Abu Huraira informed me that Alláh's Apostle said, "When I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles flew away. And I interpreted it that two liars (who would claim to be prophets) would appear after me. One of them has proved to be Al Ansi and the other, Musailima."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#5:660 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "While I was sleeping, I was given the treasures of the earth and two gold bangles were put in my hands, and I did not like that, but I received the inspiration that I should blow on them, and I did so, and both of them vanished. I interpreted it as referring to the two liars between whom I am present; the ruler of Sana and the Ruler of Yamaha."

Narrated by Abu Raja Al-Utaridi {#5:661 .italic}

We used to worship stones, and when we found a better stone than the first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter, but if we could not get a stone then we would collect some earth (i.e. soil) and then bring a sheep and milk that sheep over it, and perform the Tawaf around it. When the month of Rajab came, we used (to stop the military actions), calling this month the iron remover, for we used to remove and throw away the iron parts of every spear and arrow in the month of Rajab. Abu Raja' added: When the Prophet sent with (Alláh's) Message, I was a boy working as a shepherd of my family camels. When we heard the news about the appearance of the Prophet, we ran to the fire, i.e. to Musailima al-Kadhdhab.

We were informed that Musailima Al-Kadhdhab had arrived in Medina and stayed in the house of the daughter of Al-Harith. The daughter of Al-Harith bin Kuraiz was his wife and she was the mother of ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amir. There came to him Alláh's Apostle accompanied by Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle had a stick in his hand then. The Prophet stopped before Musailima and spoke to him. Musailima said to him, "If you wish, we would not interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the rule will be ours after you... The Prophet said, "If you asked me for this stick, I would not give it to you. I think you are the same person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin Al-Qais who will answer you on my behalf." The Prophet then went away. I asked Ibn ‘Abbás about the dream Alláh's Apostle had mentioned. Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Someone told me that the Prophet said, "When I was sleeping, I saw in a dream that two gold bangles were put in my hands, and that frightened me and made me dislike them. Then I was allowed to blow on them, and when I blew at them, both of them flew. Then I interpreted them as two liars who would appear.' One of them was Al-'Ansi who was killed by Fairuz in Yemen and the other was Musailima Al-Kadhdbab."

Then both of them said (to the Prophet ), "We will give what you should ask but you should send a trustworthy man with us, and do not send any person with us but an honest one." The Prophet said, "I will send an honest man who Is really trustworthy." Then every one of the companions of Alláh's Apostle wished to be that one. Then the Prophet said, "Get up, O Abu 'Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah." When he got up, Alláh's Apostle said, "This is the Trustworthy man of this (Muslim) nation."

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#5:664 .italic}

The people of Najran came to the Prophet and said, "Send an honest man to us." The Prophet said, "I will send to you an honest man who is really trustworthy." Everyone of the (Muslim) people hoped to be that one. The Prophet then sent Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah.

But the revenue of Al-Bahrain did not come till Alláh's Apostle had died. When the revenue came during the rule of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to announce, "Whoever had any debt or promise due upon the Prophet, should present himself to me (i.e. Abu Bakr). I came to Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet had said (to me), "If the revenue of Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so-much and so much," repeating "so much" thrice. So Abu Bakr gave me (in another narration Jaibir said,). I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him (to give me what the Prophet had promised me) but he did not give me. I again went to him but he did not give me. I again went to him (for the third time) but he did not give me; On that I said to him, "I came to you but you did not give me, then I came to you and you did not give me, and then again I came to you, but you did not give me; so you should either give me or else you are like a miserly to me, on that, Abu Bakr said, "Do you say, 'You are like a miserly to me?' There is no worse disease than miserliness." Abu Bakr said it thrice and added, "Whenever I refused to give you, I had the intention of giving you." (In another narration) Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh said, "I went to Abu Bakr (and he gave me a handful of money) and told me to count it, I counted and found it five-hundred, and then Abu Bakr said (to me), "Take the same amount twice."

When Abu Musa arrived (at Kufa as a governor) he honored this family of Jarm (by paying them a visit). I was sitting near to him, and he was eating chicken as his lunch, and there was a man sitting amongst the people. Abu Musa invited the man to the lunch, but the latter said, "I saw chickens (eating something (dirty) so I consider them unclean." Abu Musa said, "Come on! I saw the Prophet eating it (i.e. chicken)." The man said "I have taken an oath that I will not ea (chicken)" Abu Musa said." Come on! I will tell you about your oath. We, a group of Al-Ash'ariyin people went to the Prophet and asked him to give us something to ride, but the Prophet refused. Then we asked him for the second time to give us something to ride, but the Prophet took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride. After a while, some camels of booty were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that five camels be given to us. When we took those camels we said, "We have made the Prophet forget his oath, and we will not be successful after that." So I went to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh' Apostle ! You took an oath that you would not give us anything to ride, but you have given us." He said, "Yes, for if I take an oath and later I see a better solution than that, I act on the later (and gave the expiation of that oaths".

On that, Zaid bin Hudair, the brother of Ziyad bin Hudair said, (to Ibn Mas'ud), "Why have you ordered 'Alqama to recite though he does not recite better than we?" Ibn Mas'ud said, "If you like, I would tell you what the Prophet said about your nation and his (i.e. 'Alqama's) nation." So I recited fifty Verses from Sura-Maryam. ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Mas'ud) said to Khabbab, "What do you think (about 'Alqama's recitation)?" Khabbab said, "He has recited well." ‘Abdu’lláh said, "Whatever I recite, 'Alqama recites." Then ‘Abdu’lláh turned towards Khabbab and saw that he was wearing a gold ring, whereupon he said, "Hasn't the time for its throwing away come yet?" Khabbab said, "You will not see me wearing it after today," and he throw it away.

He said, "Yes, you embraced Islam when they (i.e. your people) disbelieved; you have come (to the Truth) when they ran away; you fulfilled your promises when they broke theirs; and you recognized it (i.e. the Truth of Islam) when they denied it." On that, 'Adi said, "I therefore don't care."

We went out with Alláh's Apostle during Hajjat-ul-Wada' and we assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. Then Alláh's Apostle said to us, "Whoever has got the Hádí should assume the Ihram for Hajj and 'Umra and should not finish his Ihram till he has performed both ('Umra and Hajj)." I arrived at Mecca along with him (i.e. the Prophet ) while I was menstruating, so I did not perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba or between Safa and Marwa. I informed Alláh's Apostle about that and he said, "Undo your braids and comb your hair, and then assume the lhram for Hajj and leave the 'Umra." I did so, and when we performed and finished the Hajj, Alláh's Apostles sent me to At-Tanim along with (my brother) 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, to perform the 'Umra. The Prophet said, "This 'Umra is in lieu of your missed 'Umra." Those who had assumed the lhram for 'Umra, performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa, and then finished their Ihram, and on their return from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (around the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa), but those who combined their Hajj and 'Umra, performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) (for both).

'Ata' said, "Ibn ‘Abbás said, 'If he (i.e. the one intending to perform 'Umra) has performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba, his Ihram is considered to have finished.' said, 'What proof does Ibn ‘Abbás has as to this saying?" 'Ata' said, "(The proof is taken) from the Statement of Alláh:-- "And afterwards they are brought For sacrifice unto Ancient House (Ka'ba at Mecca)" (22.33) and from the order of the Prophet to his companions to finish their Ihram during Hajjat-ul-Wada." I said (to 'Ata'), "That (i.e. finishing the Ihram) was after coming form 'Arafat." 'Ata' said, "Ibn ‘Abbás used to allow it before going to 'Arafat (after finishing the 'Umra) and after coming from it (i.e. after performing the Hajj)."

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ashari {#5:680 .italic}

I came to the Prophet at a place called Al-Batha'. The Prophet said, "Did you assume the Ihram for Hajj?" I said, "Yes," He said, "How did you express your intention (for performing Hajj)? " I said, "Labbaik (i.e. I am ready) to assume the Ihram with the same intention as that of Alláh's Apostle." The Prophet said, "Perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa, and then finish your Ihram." So I performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and between Safa and Marwa and then I came to a woman from the tribe of Qais who removed the lice from my head.

(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet ordered all his wives to finish their Ihram during the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada. On that, I asked the Prophet "What stops you from finishing your lhram?" He said, "I have matted my hair and garlanded my Hádí. So I will not finish my Ihram unless I have slaughtered my Hádí."

A woman from the tribe of Khath'am asked for the verdict of Alláh's Apostle (regarding something) during Hajjat-ul-Wada' while Al-Faḍl bin ‘Abbás was the companion-rider behind Alláh's Apostle. She asked, "Alláh's ordained obligation (i.e. compulsory Hajj) enjoined on His slaves has become due on my old father who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be sufficient if I perform the Hajj on his behalf?" He said, "Yes."

The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) in the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) while Usama was riding behind him on (his she-camel)'. Al-Qaswa.' Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha were accompanying him. When he made his she-camel kneel down near the Ka'ba, he said to 'Uthman, "Get us the key (of the Ka'ba). He brought the key to him and opened the gate (of the Ka'ba), for him. The Prophet, Usama, Bilal and 'Uthman (bin Talha) entered the Ka'ba and then closed the gate behind them (from inside). The Prophet stayed there for a long period and then came out. The people rushed to get in, but I went in before them and found Bilal standing behind the gate, and I said to him, "Where did the Prophet pray?" He said, "He prayed between those two front pillars." The Ka'ba was built on six pillars, arranged in two rows, and he prayed between the two pillars of the front row leaving the gate of the Ka'ba at his back and facing (in prayer) the wall which faces one when one enters the Ka'ba. Between him and that wall (was the distance of about three cubits). But I forgot to ask Bilal about the number of Rakat the Prophet had prayed. There was a red piece of marble at the place where he (i.e. the Prophet) had offered the prayer.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#5:685 .italic}

We were talking about Hajjat-ul-Wada, while the Prophet was amongst us. We did not know what Hajjat-ul-Wada' signified. The Prophet praised Alláh and then mentioned Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal and described him extensively, saying, "Alláh did not send any prophet but that prophet warned his nation of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. Noah and the prophets following him warned (their people) of him. He will appear amongst you (O Muḥammad's followers), and if it happens that some of his qualities may be hidden from you, but your Lord's State is clear to you and not hidden from you. The Prophet said it thrice. Verily, your Lord is not blind in one eye, while he (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) is blind in the right eye which looks like a grape bulging out (of its cluster). No doubt,! Alláh has made your blood and your properties sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours." The Prophet added: No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Alláh's Message to you? " They replied, "Yes," The Prophet said thrice, "O Alláh! Be witness for it." The Prophet added, "Woe to you!" (or said), "May Alláh be merciful to you! Do not become infidels after me (i.e. my death) by cutting the necks (throats) of one another."

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#5:688 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Time has taken its original shape which it had when Alláh created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is of twelve months, four of which are sacred, and out of these (four) three are in succession, i.e. Dhul-Qa'da, Dhul-Hijja and Al-Muharram, and the fourth is Rajab which is named after the Mudar tribe, between (the month of) Jumaida (ath-thania) and Sha'ban." Then the Prophet asked, "Which is this month?" We said, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." On that the Prophet kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it with another name. Then the Prophet said, "Isn't it the month of Dhul-Hijja?" We replied, "Yes." Then he said, "Which town is this?" "We replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." On that he kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, "Isn't it the town of Mecca?" We replied, "Yes, " Then he said, "Which day is today?" We replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." He kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, "Isn't it the day of An-Nahr (i.e. sacrifice)?" We replied, "Yes." He said, "So your blood, your properties, (The sub-narrator Muḥammad said, 'I think the Prophet also said: And your honor..) are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this city of yours, in this month of yours; and surely, you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me, cutting the throats of one another. It is incumbent on those who are present to convey this message (of mine) to those who are absent. May be that some of those to whom it will be conveyed will understand it better than those who have actually heard it." (The sub-narrator, Muḥammad, on remembering that narration, used to say, "Muḥammad spoke the truth!") He (i.e. Prophet) then added twice, "No doubt! Haven't I conveyed (Alláh's Message) to you?"

The Prophet visited me during Hajjat ul-Wada' while I was suffering from a disease which brought me to the verge of death. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! My ailment has reached such a (bad) state as you see, and I have much wealth, but I have no-one to inherit from me except my only daughter. Shall I give 2/3 of my property as alms (in charity)?" The Prophet said, "No," I said, "Shall I give half of my property as alms?" He said, "No." I said, "(Shall I give) 1/3 of it? " He replied, " 1/3, and even 1/3 is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy rather than to leave them poor, begging people (for their sustenance); and whatever you spend for Alláh's Sake, you will get reward for it even for the morsel of food which you put in your wives mouth." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Should I remain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to Medina)?" The Prophet said, "If you remain behind, any good deed which you will do for Alláh's Sake, will upgrade and elevate you. May be you will live longer so that some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) may get harmed by you." The Prophet then added, "O Alláh! Complete the Migration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels. But the poor Sad bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sad) (died in Mecca) ." Alláh's Apostle pitied Sad for he died in Mecca.

Narrated by Abu Musa {#5:699 .italic}

My Companions sent me to Alláh's Apostle to ask him for some animals to ride on as they were accompanying him in the army of Al-Usra, and that was the Ghazwa (Battle) of Tabuk, I said, "O Alláh's Prophet! My companions have sent me to you to provide them with means of transportation." He said, "By Alláh! I will not make you ride anything." It happened that when I reached him, he was in an angry mood, and I didn't notice it. So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the Prophet and for the fear that the Prophet might have become 'angry with me. So I returned to my companions and informed them of what the Prophet had said. Only a short while had passed when I heard Bilal calling, "O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais!" I replied to his call. Bilal said, "Respond to Alláh's Apostle who is calling you." When I went to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, "Take these two camels tied together and also these two camels tied together,"' referring to six camels he had brought them from Sad at that time. The Prophet added, "Take them to your companions and say, 'Alláh (or Alláh's Apostle ) allows you to ride on these,' so ride on them." So I took those camels to them and said, "The Prophet allows you to ride on these (camels) but by Alláh, I will not leave you till some of you proceed with me to somebody who heard the statement of Alláh's Apostle. Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which Alláh's Apostle has not said." They said to me, "We consider you truthful, and we will do what you like." The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of them till they came to those who have heard the statement of Alláh's Apostle wherein he denied them (some animals to ride on) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same. So these people told them the same information as Abu Musa had told them.

Alláh's Apostle set out for Tabuk. appointing ‘Alí as his deputy (in Medina). ‘Alí said, "Do you want to leave me with the children and women?" The Prophet said, "Will you not be pleased that you will be to me like Aaron to Moses? But there will be no prophet after me."

That his father said, "I participated in Al-Usra (i.e. Tabuk) along with the Prophet." Yala added, "(My participation in) that Ghazwa was the best of my deeds to me." Ya'la said, "I had a laborer who quarrelled with somebody, and one of the two bit the hand of the other ('Ata', the sub-narrator, said, "Safwan told me who bit whom but I forgot it"), and the one who was bitten, pulled his hand out of the mouth of the biter, so one of the incisors of the biter was broken. So we came to the Prophet and he considered the biter's claim as invalid (i.e. the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor). The Prophet said, "Should he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it were in the mouth of a male camel to snap it?"

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Kab bin Malik {#5:702 .italic}

Who, from among Kab's sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which he failed to take part. Kab said, "I did not remain behind Alláh's Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Alláh did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Alláh's Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Alláh made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-'Áqába (pledge) with Alláh's Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-'Áqába pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa. By Alláh, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Alláh's Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Alláh's Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Alláh's Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register." Ka'b added, "Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Alláh revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Alláh's Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Alláh's Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Alláh's Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.' In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything. Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Alláh's Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Alláh had excused. Alláh's Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka'b do?' A man from Banu Salama said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu'adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you have said! By Alláh! O Alláhs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.' Alláh's Apostle kept silent." Ka'b bin Malik added, "When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?' And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Alláh's Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth. So Alláh's Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak'at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Alláh's Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Alláh's Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Alláh to judge. Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, 'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle! But by Alláh, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse. By Alláh, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Alláh, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Alláh would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Alláh's Forgiveness. Really, by Alláh, there was no excuse for me. By Alláh, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Alláh's Apostle said, 'As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Alláh decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. 'By Alláh, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Alláh's Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Alláh's Apostle to Alláh to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' By Alláh, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' They replied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Alláh's Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it. We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Alláh's Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Alláh, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Alláh! Do you know that I love Alláh and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Alláh, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Alláh. He said, "Alláh and His Apostle know it better.' Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall." Ka'b added, "While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written: "To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Alláh does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you." When I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Alláh's Apostle and said, 'Alláh's Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.' The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Alláh gives His Verdict in this matter." Kab added, "The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' He said, 'No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Alláh, he has no desire for anything. By, Alláh, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' On that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask Alláh's Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Alláh, I will not ask the permission of Alláh's Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Alláh's Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Alláh's Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Alláh described (in the Qur’án) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala' calling with his loudest voice, 'O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down in prostration before Alláh, realizing that relief has come. Alláh's Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Alláh when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Alláh, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Alláh's Apostle. The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Alláh's Acceptance of my repentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on Alláh's Acceptance of your repentance." Kab further said, "When I entered the Mosque. I saw Alláh's Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Alláh, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha." Kab added, "When I greeted Alláh's Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said "Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you." Kab added, "I said to the Prophet 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Alláh?' He said, 'No, it is from Alláh.' Whenever Alláh's Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Alláh and His Apostle. Alláh's Apostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,' and added, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Alláh, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Alláh has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Alláh's Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Alláh will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Alláh revealed to His Apostle the Verse:-- "Verily, Alláh has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed)." (9.117-119) By Alláh, Alláh has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Alláh's Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Alláh described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else. Alláh said:-- "They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Alláh to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Alláh is not pleased with the rebellious people--" (9.95-96) Kab added, "We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Alláh's Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Alláh to forgive them, but Alláh's Apostle left our case pending till Alláh gave His Judgment about it. As for that Alláh said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind." (9.118) What Alláh said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.

"The Prophet washed his face, and when he wanted to wash his forearms, the sleeves of his cloak became tight over them, so he took them out from underneath the cloak and then he washed them (i.e. his forearms) and passed wet hands over his Khuffs."

Thursday! And how great that Thursday was! The ailment of Alláh's Apostle became worse (on Thursday) and he said, fetch me something so that I may write to you something after which you will never go astray." The people (present there) differed in this matter, and it was not right to differ before a prophet. Some said, "What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask him ( to understand his state )." So they went to the Prophet and asked him again. The Prophet said, "Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me for." Then he ordered them to do three things. He said, "Turn the pagans out of the 'Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen me dealing with them." (Said bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn ‘Abbás kept quiet as rewards the third order, or he said, "I forgot it.") (See Ḥadít_h No. 116 Vol. 1)

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "When Alláh's Apostle was on his deathbed and there were some men in the house, he said, 'Come near, I will write for you something after which you will not go astray.' Some of them ( i.e. his companions) said, 'Alláh's Apostle is seriously ill and you have the (Holy) Qur’án. Alláh's Book is sufficient for us.' So the people in the house differed and started disputing. Some of them said, 'Give him writing material so that he may write for you something after which you will not go astray.' while the others said the other way round. So when their talk and differences increased, Alláh's Apostle said, "Get up." Ibn ‘Abbás used to say, "No doubt, it was very unfortunate (a great disaster) that Alláh's Apostle was prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise."

The Prophet called Fatima during his fatal illness and told her something secretly and she wept. Then he called her again and told her something secretly, and she started laughing.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:719 .italic}

Used to hear (from the Prophet) that no Prophet dies till he is given the option to select either the worldly life or the life of the Hereafter.

(Please let me be) with the highest companion." Thereupon I said, "Hence he is not going to stay with us? " Then I came to know that his state was the confirmation of the narration he used to mention to us while he was in good health.

Alláh's Apostle looked at it, so I took the Siwak, cut it (chewed it with my teeth), shook it and made it soft (with water), and then gave it to the Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it. I had never seen Alláh's Apostle cleaning his teeth in a better way. After finishing the brushing of his teeth, he lifted his hand or his finger and said thrice, "O Alláh! Let me be with the highest companions," and then died. 'Aisha used to say, "He died while his head was resting between my chest and chin."

(the wife of the Prophet) "When the ailment of Alláh's Apostle became aggravated, he requested his wives to permit him to be (treated) nursed in my house, and they gave him permission. He came out (to my house), walking between two men with his feet dragging on the ground, between ‘Abbás bin ‘Abdu’l-Muttalib and another man" 'Ubaidullah said, "I told ‘Abdu’lláh of what 'Aisha had said, ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás said to me, 'Do you know who is the other man whom 'Aisha did not name?' I said, 'No.' Ibn ‘Abbás said, 'It was ‘Alí bin Abu Talib." 'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet used to narrate saying, "When Alláh's Apostle entered my house and his disease became aggravated, he said, " Pour on me the water of seven water skins, the mouths of which have not been untied, so that I may give advice to the people.' So we let him sit in a big basin belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet and then started to pour water on him from these water skins till he started pointing to us with his hands intending to say, 'You have done your job." 'Aisha added, "Then he went out to the people and led them in prayer and preached to them." 'Aisha and ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás said, "When Alláh's Apostle became ill seriously, he started covering his face with his woolen sheet, and when he felt short of breath, he removed it from hi; face and said, 'That is so! Alláh's (curse be on the Jews and the Christians, as they took the graves of their prophets as (places of worship),' intending to warn (the Muslims ) of what they had done." 'Aisha added, "I argued with Alláh's Apostle repeatedly about that matter (i.e. his order that Abu Bakr should lead the people in prayer in his place when he was ill), and what made me argue so much, was, that it never occurred to my mind that after the Prophet, the people would ever love a man who had taken his place, and I felt that anybody standing in his place, would be a bad omen to the people, so I wanted Alláh's Apostle to give up the idea of choosing Abu Bakr (to lead the people in prayer)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás {#5:728 .italic}

‘Alí bin Abu Talib came out of the house of Alláh's Apostle during his fatal illness. The people asked, "O Abu Ḥasan (i.e. ‘Alí)! How is the health of Alláh's Apostle this morning?" ‘Alí replied, "He has recovered with the Grace of Alláh." ‘Abbás bin ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib held him by the hand and said to him, "In three days you, by Alláh, will be ruled (by somebody else ), And by Alláh, I feel that Alláh's Apostle will die from this ailment of his, for I know how the faces of the offspring of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib look at the time of their death. So let us go to Alláh's Apostle and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new ruler to take care of us." ‘Alí said, "By Alláh, if we asked Alláh's Apostle for it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after that. And by Alláh, I will not ask Alláh's Apostle for it."

While the Muslims were offering the Fajr prayer on Monday and Abu Bakr was leading them in prayer, suddenly Alláh's Apostle lifted the curtain of 'Aisha's dwelling and looked at them while they were in the rows of the prayers and smiled. Abu Bakr retreated to join the row, thinking that Alláh's Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The Muslims were about to be put to trial in their prayer (i.e. were about to give up praying) because of being overjoyed at seeing Alláh's Apostle. But Alláh's Apostle beckoned them with his hand to complete their prayer and then entered the dwelling and let fall the curtain.

Narrated by Aisha {#5:730 .italic}

It was one of the favors of Alláh towards me that Alláh's Apostle expired in my house on the day of my turn while he was leaning against my chest and Alláh made my saliva mix with his saliva at his death. 'Abdur-Rahman entered upon me with a Siwak in his hand and I was supporting (the back of) Alláh's Apostle (against my chest ). I saw the Prophet looking at it (i.e. Siwak) and I knew that he loved the Siwak, so I said ( to him ), "Shall I take it for you ? " He nodded in agreement. So I took it and it was too stiff for him to use, so I said, "Shall I soften it for you ?" He nodded his approval. So I softened it and he cleaned his teeth with it. In front of him there was a jug or a tin, (The sub-narrator, ‘Umar is in doubt as to which was right) containing water. He started dipping his hand in the water and rubbing his face with it, he said, "None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh. Death has its agonies." He then lifted his hands (towards the sky) and started saying, "With the highest companion," till he expired and his hand dropped down.

So he stayed at 'Aisha's house till he expired while he was with her." 'Aisha added, "The Prophet expired on the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Alláh while his head was against my chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva." 'Aisha added, "Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Alláh's Apostle looked at it and I said to him, 'O 'AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.' So he gave it to me and I cut it, chewed it (it's end) and gave it to Alláh's Apostle who cleaned his teeth with it while he was resting against my chest."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#5:732 .italic}

The Prophet expired in my house and on the day of my turn, leaning against my chest. One of us (i.e. the Prophet's wives ) used to recite a prayer asking Alláh to protect him from all evils when he became sick. So I started asking Alláh to protect him from all evils (by reciting a prayer ). He raised his head towards the sky and said, "With the highest companions, with the highest companions." 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr passed carrying a fresh leaf-stalk of a date-palm and the Prophet looked at it and I thought that the Prophet was in need of it (for cleaning his teeth ). So I took it (from 'Abdur Rahman) and chewed its head and shook it and gave it to the Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it, in the best way he had ever cleaned his teeth, and then he gave it to me, and suddenly his hand dropped down or it fell from his hand (i.e. he expired). So Alláh made my saliva mix with his saliva on his last day on earth and his first day in the Hereafter.

He dismounted and entered the Mosque, but did not speak to the people till he entered upon 'Aisha and went straight to Alláh's Apostle who was covered with Hibra cloth (i.e. a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered the Prophet's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Alláh, Alláh will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come upon you." Narrated Ibn ‘Abbás: Abu Bakr went out while ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab was talking to the people. Abu Bakr said, "Sit down, O ‘Umar!" But ‘Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left ‘Umar. Abu Bakr said, "To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muḥammad , then Muḥammad is dead, but if (anyone of) you used to worship Alláh, then Alláh is Alive and shall never die. Alláh said:--"Muḥammad is no more than an Apostle, and indeed (many) apostles have passed away before him..(till the end of the Verse )......Alláh will reward to those who are thankful." (3.144) By Alláh, it was as if the people never knew that Alláh had revealed this Verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and all the people received it from him, and I heard everybody reciting it (then). Narrated Az-Zuhri: Said bin Al-Musaiyab told me that ‘Umar said, "By Alláh, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that the Prophet had died."

The Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, 'Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.' So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father of all the people, and Alláh created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).' Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, 'Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Alláh sent to the inhabitants of the earth.' They will go to him and Noah will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, 'Go to the Khalil--r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).' They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Alláh spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .' So they will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, 'Go to Jesus, Alláh's Slave, His Apostle and Alláh's Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muḥammad the Slave of Alláh whose past and future sins were forgiven by Alláh.' So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord's Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.' (Muḥammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' I will raise my head and praise Alláh with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Alláh, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Alláh will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, 'None remains in Hell but those whom the Qur’án has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.' " (The compiler) Abu ‘Abdu’lláh said: 'But those whom the Qur’án has imprisoned in Hell,' refers to the Statement of Alláh: "They will dwell therein forever." (16.29)

What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?'. The Prophet said, "Just now Gabriel has informed me about that." ‘Abdu’lláh said, "Gabriel?" The Prophet said, "Yes." ‘Abdu’lláh said, "He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews." On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse: "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur’án) down to your heart by Alláh's permission." (2.97) Then he added, "As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man's discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman's discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother." On hearing that, ‘Abdu’lláh said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, and that you are the Apostle of Alláh, O, Alláh's Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar." In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, "What is ‘Abdu’lláh's status amongst you?" They replied, "He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief." The Prophet said, "What would you think if ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam embraced Islam?" They replied, "May Alláh protect him from this!" Then ‘Abdu’lláh came out and said, "I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and that Muḥammad is the Apostle of Alláh." The Jews then said, "‘Abdu’lláh is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us," and disparaged him. On that ‘Abdu’lláh said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!"

‘Umar said, "Our best Qur’án reciter is Ubai and our best judge is ‘Alí; and in spite of this, we leave some of the statements of Ubai because Ubai says, 'I do not leave anything that I have heard from Alláh's Apostle while Alláh: "Whatever verse (Revelations) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We bring a better one or similar to it." (2.106)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:9 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Alláh said, 'The son of Adam tells a lie against me though he has no right to do so, and he abuses Me though he has no right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is that he claims that I cannot recreate him as I created him before; and as for his abusing Me, it is his statement that I have offspring. No! Glorified be Me! I am far from taking a wife or offspring.' "

Narrated by Anas {#6:10 .italic}

‘Umar said, "I agreed with Alláh in three things," or said, "My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.' I also said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, 'You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Alláh will give His Apostle better wives than you.' When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O ‘Umar! Does Alláh's Apostle haven't what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?' " Thereupon Alláh revealed:-- "It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Alláh).." (66.5)

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:11 .italic}

(The wife of the Prophet) Alláh's Apostle said, "Don't you see that when your people built the Ka'ba, they did not build it on all Abraham's foundations?" I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why don't you rebuild it on Abraham's foundations?" He said, "Were your people not so close to (the period of Heathenism, i.e. the Period between their being Muslims and being infidels), I would do so." The sub-narrator, ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar said, "Aisha had surely heard Alláh's Apostle saying that, for I do not think that Alláh's Apostle left touching the two corners of the Ka'ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka'ba was not built on all Abraham's foundations."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:12 .italic}

The people of the Scripture (Jews) used to recite the Torah in Hebrew and they used to explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. On that Alláh's Apostle said, "Do not believe the people of the Scripture or disbelieve them, but say: "We believe in Alláh and what is revealed to us." (2.136)

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:13 .italic}

The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Ka'ba (at Mecca). (So Alláh Revealed (2.144) and he offered 'Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Ka'ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, "I, (swearing by Alláh,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca." Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka'ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka'ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Alláh revealed: "And Alláh would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem). Truly Alláh is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind." (2.143)

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#6:14 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Noah will be called on the Day of Resurrection and he will say, 'Labbaik and Sa'daik, O my Lord!' Alláh will say, 'Did you convey the Message?' Noah will say, 'Yes.' His nation will then be asked, 'Did he convey the Message to you?' They will say, 'No Warner came to us.' Then Alláh will say (to Noah), 'Who will bear witness in your favor?' He will say, 'Muḥammad and his followers. So they (i.e. Muslims) will testify that he conveyed the Message. And the Apostle (Muḥammad) will be a witness over yourselves, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Alláh "Thus We have made of you a just and the best nation that you may be witnesses over mankind and the Apostle (Muḥammad) will be a witness over yourselves." (2.143)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:15 .italic}

While some people were offering Fajr prayer in the Quba' mosque, some-one came and said, "Alláh has revealed to the Prophet Qur’ánic instructions that you should face the Ka'ba (while praying) so you too, should face it." Those people then turned towards the Ka'ba.

Narrated by Anas {#6:16 .italic}

None remains of those who prayed facing both Qiblas (that is, Jerusalem and Mecca) except myself.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:17 .italic}

While some people were offering morning prayer at Quba' a man came to them and said, "A Qur’ánic Order has been revealed to Alláh's Apostle tonight that he should face the Ka'ba at Mecca (in prayer), so you too should turn your faces towards it." At that moment their faces were towards Sham (i.e. Jerusalem) (and on hearing that) they turned towards the Ka'ba (at Mecca).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:18 .italic}

While some people were offering Fajr prayer at Quba' (mosque), some-one came to them and said, "Tonight some Qur’ánic Verses have been revealed to the Prophet and he has been ordered to face the Ka'ba (at Mecca) (during prayers), so you too should turn your faces towards it." At that time their faces were towards Sham (Jerusalem) so they turned towards the Ka'ba (at Mecca).

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:19 .italic}

We prayed along with the Prophet facing Jerusalem for sixteen or seventeen months. Then Alláh ordered him to turn his face towards the Qibla (in Mecca): "And from whence-so-ever you start forth (for prayers) turn your face in the direction of (the Sacred Mosque of Mecca) Al-Masjid-ul Haram." (2.149)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:20 .italic}

While some people were at Quba (offering) morning prayer, a man came to them and said, "Last night Qur’ánic Verses have been revealed whereby the Prophet has been ordered to face the Ka'ba (at Mecca), so you too should face it." So they, keeping their postures, turned towards the Ka'ba. Formerly the people were facing Sham (Jerusalem) (Alláh said): "And from whence-so-ever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque of Mecca (Al-Masjid-ul-Haram), and whence-so-ever you are, turn your face towards it (when you pray)" (2.150)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:21 .italic}

While some people were offering Fajr prayer at Quba mosque, someone came to them and said, "Qur’ánic literature" has been revealed to Alláh's Apostle tonight, and he has been ordered to face the Ka'ba (of Mecca) so you too, should turn your faces towards it. Their faces were then towards Sham (Jerusalem), so they turned towards the Qibla (i.e. Ka'ba of Mecca)."

Narrated by Urwa {#6:22 .italic}

I said to 'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, and I was at that time a young boy, "How do you interpret the Statement of Alláh: "Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Alláh." So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj to the House of Alláh) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them. In my opinion it is not sinful for one not to ambulate (Tawaf) between them." 'Aisha said, "Your interpretation is wrong for as you say, the Verse should have been: "So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj or Umra to the House, not to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.' This Verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who (during the Pre-Islamic Period) used to visit Manat (i.e. an idol) after assuming their Ihram, and it was situated near Qudaid (i.e. a place at Mecca), and they used to regard it sinful to ambulate between Safa and Marwa after embracing Islam. When Islam came, they asked Alláh's Apostle about it, whereupon Alláh revealed: "Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Alláh. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Alláh) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them." (2.158)

Narrated by 'Asim bin Sulaiman {#6:23 .italic}

I asked Anas bin Malik about Safa and Marwa. Anas replied, "We used to consider (i.e. going around) them a custom of the Pre-islamic period of Ignorance, so when Islam came, we gave up going around them. Then Alláh revealed" "Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Alláh. So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj of the House (of Alláh) or perform the Umra to ambulate (Tawaf) between them." (2.158)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:24 .italic}

The Prophet said one statement and I said another. The Prophet said "Whoever dies while still invoking anything other than Alláh as a rival to Alláh, will enter Hell (Fire)." And I said, "Whoever dies without invoking anything as a rival to Alláh, will enter Paradise."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:25 .italic}

The law of Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) was prescribed for the children of Israel, but the Diya (i.e. blood money was not ordained for them). So Alláh said to this Nation (i.e. Muslims): "O you who believe! The law of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in cases of murder: The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if the relatives (or one of them) of the killed (person) forgive their brother (i.e. the killers something of Qisas (i.e. not to kill the killer by accepting blood money in the case of intentional murder)...then the relatives (of the killed person) should demand blood-money in a reasonable manner and the killer must pay with handsome gratitude. This is an allevitation and a Mercy from your Lord, (in comparison to what was prescribed for the nations before you). So after this, whoever transgresses the limits (i.e. to kill the killer after taking the blood-money) shall have a painful torment." (2.178)

Narrated by Anas {#6:26 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The prescribed Law of Alláh is the equality in punishment (i.e. Al-Qisas)." (In cases of murders, etc.)

Narrated by Anas {#6:27 .italic}

That his aunt, Ar-Rubai' broke an incisor tooth of a girl. My aunt's family requested the girl's relatives for forgiveness but they refused; then they proposed a compensation, but they refused. Then they went to Alláh's Apostle and refused everything except Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment). So Alláh's Apostle passed the judgment of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality of punishment). Anas bin Al-Nadr said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Will the incisor tooth of Ar-Rubai be broken? No, by Him Who sent you with the Truth, her incisor tooth will not be broken." Alláh's Apostle said, "O Anas! The prescribed law of Alláh is equality in punishment (i.e. Al-Qisas.)" Thereupon those people became satisfied and forgave her. Then Alláh's Apostle said, "Among Alláh's Worshippers there are some who, if they took Alláh's Oath (for something), Alláh fulfill their oaths."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:28 .italic}

Fasting was observed on the day of 'Ashura' (i.e. 10th of Muharram) by the people of the Pre-lslamic Period. But when (the order of compulsory fasting) in the month of Ramaḍán was revealed, the Prophet said, "It is up to one to fast on it (i.e. day of 'Ashura') or not."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:29 .italic}

The people used to fast on the day of 'Ashura' before fasting in Ramaḍán was prescribed but when (the order of compulsory fasting in) Ramaḍán was revealed, it was up to one to fast on it (i.e. 'Ashura') or not.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:30 .italic}

That Al-Ash'ath entered upon him while he was eating. Al-Ash'ath said, "Today is 'Ashura." I said (to him), "Fasting had been observed (on such a day) before (the order of compulsory fasting in) Ramaḍán was revealed. But when (the order of fasting in) Ramaḍán was revealed, fasting (on 'Ashura') was given up, so come and eat."

Narrated by Aisha {#6:31 .italic}

During the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance the Quraish used to observe fasting on the day of 'Ashura', and the Prophet himself used to observe fasting on it too. But when he came to Medina, he fasted on that day and ordered the Muslims to fast on it. When (the order of compulsory fasting in ) Ramaḍán was revealed, fasting in Ramaḍán became an obligation, and fasting on 'Ashura' was given up, and who ever wished to fast (on it) did so, and whoever did not wish to fast on it, did not fast.

Narrated by 'Ata {#6:32 .italic}

That he heard Ibn ‘Abbás reciting the Divine Verse: "And for those who can fast they had a choice either fast, or feed a poor for every day.." (2.184) Ibn ‘Abbás said, "This Verse is not abrogated, but it is meant for old men and old women who have no strength to fast, so they should feed one poor person for each day of fasting (instead of fasting)."

Narrated by Nafi {#6:33 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar recited: "They had a choice, either fast or feed a poor for every day.." and added, "This Verse is abrogated."

Narrated by Salama {#6:34 .italic}

When the Divine Revelation: "For those who can fast, they had a choice either fast, or feed a poor for every day," (2.184) was revealed, it was permissible for one to give a ransom and give up fasting, till the Verse succeeding it was revealed and abrogated it.

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:35 .italic}

When the order of compulsory fasting of Ramaḍán was revealed, the people did not have sexual relations with their wives for the whole month of Ramaḍán, but some men cheated themselves (by violating that restriction). So Alláh revealed: "Alláh is aware that you were deceiving yourselves but He accepted your repentance and for gave you.." (3.187)

Narrated by Ash-Sha'bi {#6:36 .italic}

'Adi took a white rope (or thread) and a black one, and when some part of the night had passed, he looked at them but he could not distinguish one from the other. The next morning he said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I put (a white thread and a black thread) underneath my pillow." The Prophet said, "Then your pillow is too wide if the white thread (of dawn) and the black thread (of the night) are underneath your pillow! "

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#6:37 .italic}

I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is the meaning of the white thread distinct from the black thread? Are these two threads?" He said, "You are not intelligent if you watch the two threads." He then added, "No, it is the darkness of the night and the whiteness of the day.''

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#6:38 .italic}

The Verse: "And eat and drink until the white thread appears to you distinct from the black thread." was revealed, but: '... of dawn' was not revealed (along with it) so some men, when intending to fast, used to tie their legs, one with white thread and the other with black thread and would keep on eating till they could distinguish one thread from the other. Then Alláh revealed' ... of dawn,' whereupon they understood that meant the night and the day.

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:39 .italic}

In the Pre-lslamic Period when the people assumed Ihram, they would enter their houses from the back. So Alláh revealed: "And it is not righteousness that you enter houses from the back, but the righteous man is he who fears Alláh, obeys His Orders and keeps away from what He has forbidden. So enter houses through their doors." (2.189)

Narrated by Nafi' {#6:40 .italic}

During the affliction of Ibn Az-Zubair, two men came to Ibn ‘Umar and said, "The people are lost, and you are the son of ‘Umar, and the companion of the Prophet, so what forbids you from coming out?" He said, "What forbids me is that Alláh has prohibited the shedding of my brother's blood." They both said, "Didn't Alláh say, 'And fight then until there is no more affliction?" He said "We fought until there was no more affliction and the worship is for Alláh (Alone while you want to fight until there is affliction and until the worship become for other than Alláh." Narrated Nafi (through another group of sub-narrators): A man came to Ibn ‘Umar and said, "O Abu Abdur Rahman! What made you perform Hajj in one year and Umra in another year and leave the Jihad for Alláh' Cause though you know how much Alláh recommends it?" Ibn ‘Umar replied, "O son of my brother! Islam is founded on five principles, i.e. believe in Alláh and His Apostle, the five compulsory prayers, the fasting of the month of Ramaḍán, the payment of Zakat, and the Hajj to the House (of Alláh)." The man said, "O Abu Abdur Rahman! Won't you listen to why Alláh has mentioned in His Book: 'If two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them, but if one of then transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then you all fight against the one that transgresses. (49.9) and: "And fight them till there is no more affliction (i.e. no more worshiping of others along with Alláh)." Ibn ‘Umar said, "We did it, during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle when Islam had only a few followers. A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured. But when the Muslims increased, there was no more afflictions or oppressions." The man said, "What is your opinion about 'Uthman and ‘Alí?" Ibn ‘Umar said, "As for 'Uthman, it seems that Alláh has forgiven him, but you people dislike that he should be forgiven. And as for ‘Alí, he is the cousin of Alláh's Apostle and his son-in-law." Then he pointed with his hand and said, "That is his house which you see."

Narrated by Abu Wail {#6:41 .italic}

Hudhaifa said, "The Verse: "And spend (of your wealth) in the Cause of Alláh and do not throw yourselves in destruction," (2.195) was revealed concerning spending in Alláh's Cause (i.e. Jihad)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Maqal {#6:42 .italic}

I sat with Ka'b bin Ujra in this mosque, i.e. Kufa Mosque, and asked him about the meaning of: "Pay a ransom (i.e. Fidya) of either fasting or - - - - (2.196) He said, "I was taken to the Prophet while lice were falling on my face. The Prophet said, 'I did not think that your trouble reached to such an extent. Can you afford to slaughter a sheep (as a ransom for shaving your head)?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Then fast for three days, or feed six poor persons by giving half a Sa of food for each and shave your head.' So the above Verse was revealed especially for me and generally for all of you."

Narrated by 'Imran bin Ḥusayn {#6:43 .italic}

The Verse of Hajj-at-Tamatu was revealed in Alláh's Book, so we performed it with Alláh's Apostle, and nothing was revealed in Qur’án to make it illegal, nor did the Prophet prohibit it till he died. But the man (who regarded it illegal) just expressed what his own mind suggested.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:44 .italic}

'Ukaz, Mijanna and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the Pre-islamic Period. They (i.e. Muslims) considered it a sin to trade there during the Hajj time (i.e. season), so this Verse was revealed: "There is no harm for you if you seek of the Bounty of your Lord during the Hajj season." (2.198)

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:45 .italic}

The Quraish people and those who embraced their religion, used to stay at Muzdalifa and used to call themselves Al-Hums, while the rest of the Arabs used to stay at 'Arafat. When Islam came, Alláh ordered His Prophet to go to 'Arafat and stay at it, and then pass on from there, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Alláh: "Then depart from the place whence all the people depart..." (2.199)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:46 .italic}

A man who wants to perform the Hajj (from Mecca) can perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba as long as he is not in the state of Ihram till he assumes the Ihram for Hajj. Then, if he rides and proceeds to 'Arafat, he should take a Hádí (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of 'Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of 'Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to 'Arafat and stay there from the time of the 'Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from 'Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam' (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Alláh to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Alláh greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Alláh is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Alláh said: "Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Alláh's Forgiveness. Truly! Alláh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra.

The Prophet said, "The most hated man in the Sight of Alláh is the one who is the most quarrelsome." Narrated 'Aisha: The Prophet said, "Or do you think that you shall enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you?" (2.214)

Narrated by Ibn Abu Mulaika {#6:49 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás recited: "(Respite will be granted) until when the Apostles gave up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people). There came to them Our Help ...." (12.110) reading Kudhibu without doubling the sound 'dh', and that was what he understood of the Verse. Then he went on reciting: "..even the Apostle and those who believed along with him said: When (will come) Alláh's Help? Yes, verily, Alláh's Help is near." (2.214) Then I met 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I mentioned that to him. He said, "Aisha said, 'Alláh forbid! By Alláh, Alláh never promised His Apostle anything but he knew that it would certainly happen before he died. But trials were continuously presented before the Apostles till they were afraid that their followers would accuse them of telling lies. So I used to recite:-- "Till they (come to) think that they were treated as liars." reading 'Kudh-dhibu with double 'dh.'

Narrated by Nafi' {#6:50 .italic}

Whenever Ibn ‘Umar recited the Qur’án, he would not speak to anyone till he had finished his recitation. Once I held the Qur’án and he recited Surat-al-Baqara from his memory and then stopped at a certain Verse and said, "Do you know in what connection this Verse was revealed? " I replied, "No." He said, "It was revealed in such-and-such connection." Ibn ‘Umar then resumed his recitation. Nafi added regarding the Verse: "So go to your tilth when or how you will" Ibn ‘Umar said, "It means one should approach his wife in .."

Narrated by Jabir {#6:51 .italic}

Jews used to say: "If one has sexual intercourse with his wife from the back, then she will deliver a squint-eyed child." So this Verse was revealed: "Your wives are a tilth unto you; so go to your tilth when or how you will." (2.223)

Narrated by Al-Ḥasan {#6:52 .italic}

The sister of Ma'qal bin Yasar was divorced by her husband who left her till she had fulfilled her term of 'Iddat (i.e. the period which should elapse before she can Remarry) and then he wanted to remarry her but Maqal refused, so this Verse was revealed: "Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands." (2.232)

Narrated by Ibn Az-Zubair {#6:53 .italic}

I said to 'Uthman bin 'Affan (while he was collecting the Qur’án) regarding the Verse: "Those of you who die and leave wives ..." (2.240) "This Verse was abrogated by an other Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur’án)?" 'Uthman said. "O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place."

Narrated by Mujahi {#6:54 .italic}

(regarding the Verse): "Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They - (their wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days)." (2.234) The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband's family, so Alláh revealed: "Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year's maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.' (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240). So Alláh entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband's home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Alláh says: "..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you." So the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her. 'Ata said: Ibn ‘Abbás said, "This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Alláh: "..without turning them out.." cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband's house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes." 'Ata's aid: If she wished, she could complete her 'Idda by staying in her dead husband's residence according to the will or leave it according to Alláh's Statement: "There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves." 'Ata' added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband's house), so she could complete the 'Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn ‘Abbás said, "This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow's) dwelling in her dead husband's house and she could complete the 'Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Alláh's Statement says: "...without turning them out..."

I sat in a gathering in which the chiefs of the Ansar were present, and Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Laila was amongst them. I mentioned the narration of ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Utba regarding the question of Subai'a bint Al-Harith. Abdur-Rahman said, "But ‘Abdu’lláh's uncle used not to say so." I said, "I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa," and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin 'Amir or Malik bin 'Auf, and said, "What was the verdict of Ibn Mas'ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?" He replied, "Ibn Mas'ud said, 'Why do you impose on her the hard order and don't let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at-Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara)." (i.e. Her 'Idda is up till she delivers.)

On the day of Al-Khandaq (the battle of the Trench). the Prophet said, "They (i.e. pagans prevented us from offering the middle (the Best) Prayer till the sun had set. May Alláh fill their graves, their houses (or their bodies) with fire."

Narrated by Zaid bin Arqam {#6:58 .italic}

We used to speak while in prayer. One of us used to speak to his brother (while in prayer) about his need, till the Verse was revealed: "Guard strictly the (five obligatory) prayers, especially the middle (the Best) (Asr) Prayer and stand before Alláh with obedience (and not to speak to others during the prayers)." Then we were ordered not to speak in the prayers.

Narrated by Nafi' {#6:59 .italic}

Whenever ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. prayer of fear) he said, "The Imam comes forward with a group of people and leads them in a one Rak'a prayer while another group from them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one Rak'a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a Rak'a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two Rakat, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second Rak'a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two Rakat. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not." Nafi added: I do not think that ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar narrated this except from Alláh's Apostle (See Ḥadít_h No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly "The Fear Prayer.")

I have something in my mind to say about it." ‘Umar said, "O son of my brother! Say, and do not under estimate yourself." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "This Verse has been set up as an example for deeds." ‘Umar said, "What kind of deeds?" Ibn ‘Abbás said, "For deeds." ‘Umar said, "This is an example for a rich man who does goods out of obedience of Alláh and then Alláh sends him Satan whereupon he commits sins till all his good deeds are lost."

And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in it (i.e. in the Qur’án) the whole of it (i.e. its clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord. And none receive admonition except men of understanding." (3.7) Then Alláh's Apostle said, "If you see those who follow thereof that is not entirely clear, then they are those whom Alláh has named \[as having deviation (from the Truth)\] 'So beware of them."

(3.77) Then entered Al-Ash'ath bin Qais and said, "What is Abu 'Abdur-Rahman narrating to you?" We replied, 'So-and-so." Al-Ash'ath said, "This Verse was revealed in my connection. I had a well in the land of my cousin (and he denied my, possessing it). On that the Prophet said to me, 'Either you bring forward a proof or he (i.e. your cousin) takes an oath (to confirm his claim)' I said, 'I am sure he would take a (false) oath, O Alláh's Apostle.' He said, 'If somebody takes an oath when asked to do so through which he may deprive a Muslim of his property (unlawfully) and he is a liar in his oath, he will meet Alláh Who will be angry with him.'

Will you remind her (i.e. the defendant), of Alláh and recite before her: "Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Alláh's Covenant and their oaths..."(3.77) So they reminded her and she confessed. Ibn ‘Abbás then said, "The Prophet said, 'The oath is to be taken by the defendant (in the absence of any proof against him)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:75 .italic}

Abu Sufyan narrated to me personally, saying, "I set out during the Truce that had been concluded between me and Alláh's Apostle. While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Alláh, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst you? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us." Heraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' He said, 'Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are increasing.' He said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.' He said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it" Abu Sufyan added, "By Alláh, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, 'No.' Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), 'I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muḥammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Alláh. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him." Abu Safyan said, "Heraclius then asked me, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.' Then Heraclius said, 'If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Alláh's Apostle and read it wherein was written: "In the Name of Alláh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muḥammad, Apostle of Alláh, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine... Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Alláh's Punishment); embrace Islam, and Alláh will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Alláh's Statement): "O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but Alláh....bear witness that we are Muslims.' (3.64) When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out." Abu Sufyan added, "While coming out, I said to my companions, 'The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muḥammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.' So I continued to believe that Alláh's Apostle would be victorious, till Alláh made me embrace Islam." Az-Zuhri said, "Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, 'O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?' (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, 'Bring them back to me.' So he called them and said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.' Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him." (See Ḥadít_h No. 6,Vol 1)

Out of all the Ansar, living in Medina, Abu Talha had the largest number of (date palm trees) gardens, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was standing opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet). Alláh's Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good water. When the Verse: "By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love." (3.92) Abu Talha got up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle, Alláh says: "By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love." (3.92) and the most beloved of my property to me is the Bairuha garden, so I give it (as a charitable gift) in Alláh's Cause and hope to receive good out of it, and to have it stored for me with Alláh. So, O Alláh's Apostle! Dispose it of (i.e. utilize it) in the way Alláh orders you (to dispose it of)." Alláh's Apostle said, "Bravo! That is a fruitful property! That is a fruitful property! I have heard what you have said and I think that you should distribute that (garden) amongst your relatives." The Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#6:79 .italic}

The Jews brought to the Prophet a man and a woman from among them who had committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said to them, "How do you usually punish the one amongst you who has committed illegal sexual intercourse?" They replied, "We blacken their faces with coal and beat them," He said, "Don't you find the order of Ar-Rajm (i.e. stoning to death) in the Torah?" They replied, "We do not find anything in it." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam (after hearing this conversation) said to them. "You have told a lie! Bring here the Torah and recite it if you are truthful." (So the Jews brought the Torah). And the religious teacher who was teaching it to them, put his hand over the Verse of Ar-Rajm and started reading what was written above and below the place hidden with his hand, but he did not read the Verse of Ar-Rajm. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam removed his (i.e. the teacher's) hand from the Verse of Ar-Rajm and said, "What is this?" So when the Jews saw that Verse, they said, "This is the Verse of Ar-Rajm." So the Prophet ordered the two adulterers to be stoned to death, and they were stoned to death near the place where biers used to be placed near the Mosque. I saw her companion (i.e. the adulterer) bowing over her so as to protect her from the stones.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:80 .italic}

The Verse: "You (true Muslims) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind." means, the best of peoples for the people, as you bring them with chains on their necks till they embrace Islam.

That he heard Alláh's Apostle on raising his head from the bowing in the last Rak'a in the Fajr prayer, saying, "O Alláh, curse such-and-such person and such-and-such person, and such-and-such person," after saying, "Alláh hears him who sends his praises to Him, O our Lord, all praise is for you." So Alláh revealed: "Not for you (O Muḥammad) (but for Alláh) is the decision, verily they are indeed wrongdoers." (3.128)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:83 .italic}

Whenever Alláh's Apostle intended to invoke evil upon somebody or invoke good upon somebody, he used to invoke (Alláh after bowing (in the prayer). Sometimes after saying, "Alláh hears him who sends his praises to Him, all praise is for You, O our Lord," he would say, "O Alláh. Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid and Salama bin Hisham, and 'Aiyash bin Abu Rabi'a. O Alláh! Inflict Your Severe Torture on Mudar (tribe) and strike them with (famine) years like the years of Joseph." The Prophet used to say in a loud voice, and he also used to say in some of his Fajr prayers, "O Alláh! Curse so-and-so and so-and-so." naming some of the Arab tribes till Alláh revealed: "Not for you (O Muḥammad) (but for Alláh) is the decision." (3.128)

'Alláh is Sufficient for us and He Is the Best Disposer of affairs," was said by Abraham when he was thrown into the fire; and it was said by Muḥammad when they (i.e. hypocrites) said, "A great army is gathering against you, therefore, fear them," but it only increased their faith and they said: "Alláh is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer (of affairs, for us)." (3.173)

Then the Prophet recited this Divine Verse: "And let not those who covetously withhold of that which Alláh has bestowed upon them of His Bounty." (3.180)

Narrated by Usama bin Zaid {#6:89 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached that gathering, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then said, "Do not cover us with dust." Then Alláh's Apostle greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Alláh (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur’án. On that, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Saluil said, "O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him." On that ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha said, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, "Did you not hear what 'Abu Hub-b said?" He meant ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai. "He said so-and-so." On that Sad bin Ubada said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who revealed the Book to you, Alláh brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head (electing him as chief). But when Alláh opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Alláh gave to you, he (i.e. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have seen." So Alláh's Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as Alláh had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief with patience. Alláh said: "And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and from the pagans...'(3.186) And Alláh also said:--"Many of the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy..." (2.109) So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Alláh ordered him to do so till Alláh permitted fighting them. So when Alláh's Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Alláh killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, "This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious)." So they gave the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Alláh's Apostle and became Muslims.

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#6:90 .italic}

During the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle, some men among the hypocrites used to remain behind him (i.e. did not accompany him) when he went out for a Ghazwa and they would be pleased to stay at home behind Alláh's Apostle When Alláh's Apostle returned (from the battle) they would put forward (false) excuses and take oaths, wishing to be praised for what they had not done. So there was revealed: "Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done.." (3.188)

Narrated by Alqama bin Waqqas {#6:91 .italic}

Marwan said to his gatekeeper, "Go to Ibn ‘Abbás, O Rafi, and say, 'If everybody who rejoices in what he has done, and likes to be praised for what he has not done, will be punished, then all of us will be punished." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "What connection have you with this case? It was only that the Prophet called the Jews and asked them about something, and they hid the truth and told him something else, and showed him that they deserved praise for the favor of telling him the answer to his question, and they became happy with what they had concealed. Then Ibn ‘Abbás recited: "(And remember) when Alláh took a Covenant from those who were given the Scripture..and those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done.' " (3.187-188)

I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna. Alláh's Apostle talked with his wife for a while and then went to bed. When it was the last third of the night, he got up and looked towards the sky and said: "Verily! In the creation of the Heavens and the Earth and in the alteration of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding." (3.190) Then he stood up, performed ablution, brushed his teeth with a Siwak, and then prayed eleven Rakat. Then Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call for the Fajr prayer). The Prophet then offered two Rakat (Sunna) prayer and went out (to the Mosque) and offered the (compulsory congregational) Fajr prayer.

Then he went to a hanging water skin and took it, performed the ablution and then stood up to offer the prayer. I got up and did the same as he had done, and stood beside him. He put his hand on my head and held me by the ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, and finally the Witr (i.e. one Rak'a) prayer.

He then performed the ablution from it, and it was perfect ablution, and then stood up to offer the prayer. I too did the same as he had done, and then went to stand beside him.

He then offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat. then two Rakat, and finally one Rak'a, the Witr. Then he lay down again till the Muadhdhin (i.e. the call-maker) came to him, whereupon he got up and offered a light two-Rakat prayer, and went out (to the Mosque) and offered the (compulsory congregational) Fajr prayer.

Then lay down again till the Muadhdhin (i.e. the call-maker) came to him, whereupon he got up and offered a light two Rakat prayer and went out (to the Mosque) and offered the (compulsory congregational) Fajr prayer.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:97 .italic}

There was an orphan (girl) under the care of a man. He married her and she owned a date palm (garden). He married her just because of that and not because he loved her. So the Divine Verse came regarding his case: "If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls..." (4.3) The sub-narrator added: I think he (i.e. another sub-narrator) said, "That orphan girl was his partner in that datepalm (garden) and in his property."

Narrated by 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair {#6:98 .italic}

That he asked 'Aisha regarding the Statement of Alláh: "If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls..." (4.3) She said, "O son of my sister! An Orphan girl used to be under the care of a guardian with whom she shared property. Her guardian, being attracted by her wealth and beauty, would intend to marry her without giving her a just Mahr, i.e. the same Mahr as any other person might give her (in case he married her). So such guardians were forbidden to do that unless they did justice to their female wards and gave them the highest Mahr their peers might get. They were ordered (by Alláh, to marry women of their choice other than those orphan girls." 'Aisha added," The people asked Alláh's Apostle his instructions after the revelation of this Divine Verse whereupon Alláh revealed: "They ask your instruction regarding women " (4.127) 'Aisha further said, "And the Statement of Alláh: "And yet whom you desire to marry." (4.127) as anyone of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl (under his guardianship) when she is lacking in property and beauty." 'Aisha added, "So they were forbidden to marry those orphan girls for whose wealth and beauty they had a desire unless with justice, and that was because they would refrain from marrying them if they were lacking in property and beauty."

Narrated by Aisha {#6:99 .italic}

Regarding the Statement of Alláh: "And whoever amongst the guardian is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his work). This Verse was revealed regarding the orphan's property. If the guardian is poor, he can take from the property of the orphan, what is just and reasonable according to his work and the time he spends on managing it.

Narrated by Ikrama {#6:100 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás said ( regarding the verse), "And when the relatives and the orphans and the poor are present at the time of division, "this verse and its order is valid and not abrogated."

Narrated by Jabir {#6:101 .italic}

The Prophet and Abu Bakr came on foot to pay me a visit (during my illness) at Banu Salama's (dwellings). The Prophet found me unconscious, so he asked for water and performed the ablution from it and sprinkled some water over it. I came to my senses and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What do you order me to do as regards my wealth?" So there was revealed: "Alláh commands you as regards your children's (inheritance):" (4.11)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:102 .italic}

(In the Pre-Islamic Period) the children used to inherit all the property but the parents used to inherit only through a will. So Alláh cancelled that which He liked to cancel and put decreed that the share of a son was to be twice the share of a daughter, and for the parents one-sixth for each one of them, or one third, and for the wife one-eighth or one-fourth, and for the husband one-half, or one-fourth.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:103 .italic}

Regarding the Divine Verse: "O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them." (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:104 .italic}

Regarding the Verse: "To everyone, We have appointed heirs." (4.33) 'Mawali' means heirs. And regarding: "And those to whom your right hands have pledged." When the Emigrants came to Medina, an Emigrant used to be the heir of an Ansari with the exclusion of the latter's relatives, and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had established between them (i.e. the Emigrants and the Ansar). So when the Verses: "To everyone We have appointed heirs." was revealed, (the inheritance through bond of brotherhood) was cancelled. Ibn ‘Abbás then said: "And those to whom your right hands have pledged." is concerned with the covenant of helping and advising each other. So allies are no longer to be the heir of each other, but they can bequeath each other some of their property by means of a will.

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#6:105 .italic}

During the lifetime of the Prophet some people said, : O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" The Prophet said, "Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?" They replied, "No." He said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?" They replied, "No." The Prophet said, "(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Alláh on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, "Let every nation follow that which they used to worship." Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Alláh like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Alláh, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Alláh.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Alláh has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?' They will say, 'O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.' They will be directed and addressed thus, 'Will you drink,' whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, 'Who do you use to worship?' They will say, 'We used to worship Jesus, the son of Alláh.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Alláh has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,' Then it will be said to them, 'What do you want?' They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Alláh (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Alláh) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, 'What are you waiting for?' Every nation have followed what they used to worship.' They will reply, 'We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.' Alláh will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say twice or thrice, 'We do not worship any besides Alláh.' "

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Masud {#6:106 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said to me, "Recite (of the Qur’án) for me," I said, "Shall I recite it to you although it had been revealed to you?" He said, "I like to hear (the Qur’án) from others." So I recited Surat-an-Nisa' till I reached: "How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a witness, and We bring you (O Muḥammad) as a witness against these people?" (4.41) Then he said, "Stop!" And behold, his eyes were overflowing with tears."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:107 .italic}

The necklace of Asmá’ was lost, so the Prophet sent some men to look for it. The time for the prayer became due and they had not performed ablution and could not find water, so they offered the prayer without ablution. Then Alláh revealed (the Verse of Tayammum).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:108 .italic}

The Verse: "Obey Alláh and Obey the Apostle and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority." (4.59) was revealed in connection with ‘Abdu’lláh bin Hudhafa bin Qais bin 'Adi' when the Prophet appointed him as the commander of a Sariyya (army detachment).

Narrated by 'Urwa {#6:109 .italic}

Az-Zubair quarrelled with a man from the Ansar because of a natural mountainous stream at Al-Harra. The Prophet said "O Zubair! Irrigate (your lands and the let the water flow to your neighbor The Ansar said, "O Alláh's Apostle (This is because) he (Zubair) is your cousin?" At that, the Prophet's face became red (with anger) and he said "O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it fills the land up to the walls and then let it flow to your neighbor." So the Prophet enabled Az-Zubair to take his full right after the Ansari provoked his anger. The Prophet had previously given a order that was in favor of both of them Az-Zubair said, "I don't think but the Verse was revealed in this connection: "But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them." (4.6)

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:110 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "No prophet gets sick but he is given the choice to select either this world or the Hereafter." 'Aisha added: During his fatal illness, his voice became very husky and I heard him saying: "In the company of those whom is the Grace of Alláh, of the prophets, the Siddiqin (those followers of the prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them), the martyrs and the pious.' (4.69) And from this I came to know that he has been given the option.

( 4.88) Some of the companions of the Prophet returned from the battle of Uhud (i.e. refused to fight) whereupon the Muslims got divided into two parties; one of them was in favor of their execution and the other was not in favour of it. So there ware revealed: "Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites?" ( 4.88). Then the Prophet said "It (i.e. Medina) is aTayyaboh (good), it expels impurities as the fire expels the impurities of silver."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#6:114 .italic}

The people of Kufa disagreed (disputed) about the above Verse. So I went to Ibn ‘Abbás and asked him about it. He said, "This Verse: "And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell." was revealed last of all (concerning premeditated murder) and nothing abrogated it."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:115 .italic}

Regarding the Verse: "And say not to anyone who offers you peace (by accepting Islam), You are not a believer." There was a man amidst his sheep. The Muslims pursued him, and he said (to them) "Peace be on you." But they killed him and took over his sheep. Thereupon Alláh revealed in that concern, the above Verse up to: "...seeking the perishable good of this life." (4.94) i.e. those sheep.

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#6:116 .italic}

That the Prophet dictated to him: "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Alláh." Zaid added: Ibn Um Maktum came while the Prophet was dictating to me and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh, if I had the power to fight (in Alláh's Cause), I would," and he was a blind man. So Alláh revealed to his Apostle while his thigh was on my thigh, and his thigh became so heavy that I was afraid it might fracture my thigh. Then that state of the Prophet passed and Alláh revealed: "Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc)."

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:117 .italic}

When the Verse: "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)" (4.95) was revealed, Alláh Apostle called for Zaid who wrote it. In the meantime Ibn Um Maktum came and complained of his blindness, so Alláh revealed: "Except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame..." etc.) (4.95)

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:118 .italic}

When the Verse: "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)," (4.95) was revealed, the Prophet said, "Call so-and-so." That person came to him with an ink-pot and a wooden board or a shoulder scapula bone. The Prophet said (to him), "Write: 'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Alláh." Ibn Um Maktum who was sitting behind the Prophet then said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I am a blind man." So there was revealed in the place of that Verse, the Verse: "Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury, or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Alláh." (4.95)

The people of Medina were forced to prepare an army (to fight against the people of Sham during the caliphate of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair at Mecca), and I was enlisted in it; Then I met 'Ikrima, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbás, and informed him (about it), and he forbade me strongly to do so (i.e. to enlist in that army), and then said, "Ibn ‘Abbás informed me that some Muslim people were with the pagans, increasing the number of the pagans against Alláh's Apostle. An arrow used to be shot which would hit one of them (the Muslims in the company of the pagans) and kill him, or he would be struck and killed (with a sword)." Then Alláh revealed: "Verily! as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers)" (4.97) Abu Aswad added, "Except the weak ones among men, women,..." (4.98)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:121 .italic}

O Alláh, save Salama bin Hisham. O Alláh, save Al-Walid bin Al-Wahd. O Alláh, save the weak ones among the believers. O Alláh, let Your punishment be severe on the tribe of Mudar.

Regarding the Verse: "They ask your instruction concerning the women. Say: Alláh instructs you about them and yet whom you desire to marry." (4.127) (has been revealed regarding the case of) a man who has an orphan girl, and he is her guardian and her heir. The girl shares with him all his property, even a date-palm (garden), but he dislikes to marry her and dislikes to give her in marriage to somebody else who would share with him the property she is sharing with him, and for this reason that guardian prevents that orphan girl from marrying. So, this Verse was revealed: (And Alláh's statement:) "If a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part." (4.128)

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:125 .italic}

Regarding the Verse: "If a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part." (4.128) It is about a man who has a woman (wife) and he does not like her and wants to divorce her but she says to him, "I make you free as regards myself." So this Verse was revealed in this connection.

(4.145) On that ‘Abdu’lláh smiled and Hudhaifa sat somewhere in the Mosque. ‘Abdu’lláh then got up and his companions (sitting around him) dispersed. Hudhaifa then threw a pebble at me (to attract my attention). I went to him and he said, "I was surprised at ‘Abdu’lláh's smile though he understood what I said. Verily, people better than you became hypocrite and then repented and Alláh forgave them."

(It was revealed on) the day of Arafat (Hajj Day), and by Alláh, I was at Arafat" Sufyan, a sub-narrator said: I am in doubt whether the Verse: "This day I have perfected your religion for you." was revealed on a Friday or not.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:131 .italic}

The wife of the Prophet : We set out with Alláh's Apostle on one of his journeys, and when we were at Baida' or at Dhat-al-Jaish, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). Alláh's Apostle stayed there to look for it, and so did the people along with him. Neither were they at a place of water, nor did they have any water with them. So the people went to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and said, "Don't you see what 'Aisha has done? She has made Alláh's Apostle and the people, stay where there is no water and they have no water with them." Abu Bakr came while Alláh's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He said (to me), "You have detained Alláh's Apostle and the people where there is no water, and they have no water with them." So he admonished me and said what Alláh wished him to say, and he hit me on my flanks with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain! but the position of Alláh's Apostle on my thigh. So Alláh's Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water, so Alláh revealed the Verse of Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, "It is not the first blessing of yours, O the family of Abu Bakr." Then we made the camel on which I was riding, got up, and found the necklace under it.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:132 .italic}

A necklace of mine was lost at Al-Baida' and we were on our way to Medina. The Prophet made his camel kneel down and dismounted and laid his head on my lap and slept. Abu Bakr came to me and hit me violently on the chest and said, "You have detained the people because of a necklace." I kept as motionless as a dead person because of the position of Alláh's Apostle ; (on my lap) although Abu Bakr had hurt me (with the slap). Then the Prophet woke up and it was the time for the morning (prayer). Water was sought, but in vain; so the following Verse was revealed: "O you who believe! When you intend to offer prayer.." (5.6) Usaid bin Hudair said, "Alláh has blessed the people for your sake, O the family of Abu Bakr. You are but a blessing for them."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh (bin Masud) {#6:133 .italic}

"What do you say, O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Zaid?" or said, "What do you say, O Abu Qilaba?" Abu Qilaba said, "I do not know that killing a person is lawful in Islam except in three cases: a married person committing illegal sexual intercourse, one who has murdered somebody unlawfully, or one who wages war against Alláh and His Apostle." 'Anbasa said, "Anas narrated to us such-and-such." Abu Qilaba said, "Anas narrated to me in this concern, saying, some people came to the Prophet and they spoke to him saying, 'The climate of this land does not suit us.' The Prophet said, 'These are camels belonging to us, and they are to be taken out to the pasture. So take them out and drink of their milk and urine.' So they took them and set out and drank of their urine and milk, and having recovered, they attacked the shepherd, killed him and drove away the camels.' Why should there be any delay in punishing them as they murdered (a person) and waged war against Alláh and His Apostle and frightened Alláh's Apostle ?" Anbasa said, "I testify the uniqueness of Alláh!" Abu Qilaba said, "Do you suspect me?" 'Anbasa said, "No, Anas narrated that (Ḥadít_h) to us." Then 'Anbasa added, "O the people of such-and-such (country), you will remain in good state as long as Alláh keeps this (man) and the like of this (man) amongst you."

But the people (i.e. the relatives of the girl) gave up their claim and accepted a compensation. On that Alláh's Apostle said, "Some of Alláh's worshippers are such that if they take an oath, Alláh will fulfill it for them."

Some people drank alcoholic beverages in the morning (of the day) of the Uhud battle and on the same day they were killed as martyrs, and that was before wine was prohibited.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:143 .italic}

I heard ‘Umar while he was on the pulpit of the Prophet saying, "Now then O people! The revelation about the prohibition of alcoholic drinks was revealed; and alcoholic drinks are extracted from five things: Grapes, dates, honey, wheat and barley. And the alcoholic drink is that which confuses and stupefies the mind."

Narrated by Anas {#6:144 .italic}

The alcoholic drink which was spilled was Al-Fadikh. I used to offer alcoholic drinks to the people at the residence of Abu Talha. Then the order of prohibiting Alcoholic drinks was revealed, and the Prophet ordered somebody to announce that: Abu Talha said to me, "Go out and see what this voice (this announcement ) is." I went out and (on coming back) said, "This is somebody announcing that alcoholic beverages have been prohibited." Abu Talha said to me, "Go and spill it (i.e. the wine)," Then it (alcoholic drinks) was seen flowing through the streets of Medina. At that time the wine was Al-Fadikh. The people said, "Some people (Muslims) were killed (during the battle of Uhud) while wine was in their stomachs." So Alláh revealed: "On those who believe and do good deeds there is no blame for what they ate (in the past)." (5.93)

Narrated by Anas {#6:145 .italic}

The Prophet delivered a sermon the like of which I had never heard before. He said, "If you but knew what I know then you would have laughed little and wept much." On hearing that, the companions of the Prophet covered their faces and the sound of their weeping was heard. A man said, "Who is my father?" The Prophet said, "So-and-so." So this Verse was revealed: "Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble." (5.101)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:146 .italic}

Some people were asking Alláh's Apostle questions mockingly. A man would say, "Who is my father?" Another man whose she-camel had gone astray would say, "Where is my she-camel? "So Alláh revealed this Verse in this connection: "O you who believe! Ask not about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble." (5.101)

Narrated by Said bin Al-Musaiyab {#6:147 .italic}

Bahira is a she-camel whose milk is kept for the idols and nobody is allowed to milk it; Sa'iba was the she-camel which they used to set free for their gods and nothing was allowed to be carried on it. Abu Huraira said: Alláh's Apostle said, "I saw 'Amr bin 'Amir Al-Khuzai (in a dream) dragging his intestines in the Fire, and he was the first person to establish the tradition of setting free the animals (for the sake of their deities)," Wasila is the she-camel which gives birth to a she-camel as its first delivery, and then gives birth to another she-camel as its second delivery. People (in the Pre-lslamic periods of ignorance) used to let that she camel loose for their idols if it gave birth to two she-camels successively without giving birth to a male camel in between. 'Ham' was the male camel which was used for copulation. When it had finished the number of copulations assigned for it, they would let it loose for their idols and excuse it from burdens so that nothing would be carried on it, and they called it the 'Hami.' Abu Huraira said, "I heard the Prophet saying so."

Narrated by Aisha {#6:148 .italic}

Then (quoting Qur’án) he said: "As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. A promise We have undertaken: Truly we shall do it." (21.104) The Prophet then said, "The first of the human beings to be dressed on the Day of Resurrection, will be Abraham. Lo! Some men from my followers will be brought and then (the angels) will drive them to the left side (Hell-Fire). I will say. 'O my Lord! (They are) my companions!' Then a reply will come (from Almighty), 'You do not know what they did after you.' I will say as the pious slave (the Prophet Jesus) said: And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them. When You took me up. You were the Watcher over them and You are a Witness to all things.' (5.117) Then it will be said, "These people have continued to be apostates since you left them."

When they called him, the Prophet said, "Why did you slap him?" He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! While I was passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, 'By Him Who selected Moses above the human beings,' I said, 'Even above Muḥammad?' I became furious and slapped him on the face." The Prophet said, "Do not give me superiority over the other prophets, for on the Day of Resurrection the people will become unconscious and I will be the first to regain consciousness. Then I will see Moses holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not know whether he has come to his senses before me or that the shock he had received at the Mountain, (during his worldly life) was sufficient for him."

There was a dispute between Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and Abu Bakr made ‘Umar angry. So ‘Umar left angrily. Abu Bakr followed him, requesting him to ask forgiveness (of Alláh) for him, but ‘Umar refused to do so and closed his door in Abu Bakr's face. So Abu Bakr went to Alláh's Apostle while we were with him. Alláh's Apostle said, "This friend of yours must have quarrelled (with somebody)." In the meantime ‘Umar repented and felt sorry for what he had done, so he came, greeted (those who were present) and sat with the Prophet and related the story to him. Alláh's Apostle became angry and Abu Bakr started saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh, I was more at fault (than ‘Umar)." Alláh's Apostle said, "Are you (people) leaving for me my companion? (Abu Bakr), Are you (people) leaving for me my companion? When I said, 'O people I am sent to you all as the Apostle of Alláh,' you said, 'You tell a lie.' while Abu Bakr said, 'You have spoken the truth ."

'Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa came and stayed with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais who was one of those whom ‘Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra' (learned men knowing Qur’án by heart) were the people of ‘Umar's meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. 'Uyaina said to his nephew, "O son of my brother! You have an approach to this chief, so get for me the permission to see him." Al-Hurr said, "I will get the permission for you to see him." So Al-Hurr asked the permission for 'Uyaina and ‘Umar admitted him. When 'Uyaina entered upon him, he said, "Beware! O the son of Al-Khattab! By Alláh, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice." Thereupon ‘Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him, but Al-Hurr said, "O chief of the Believers! Alláh said to His Prophet: "Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; and leave (don't punish) the foolish." (7.199) and this (i.e. 'Uyaina) is one of the foolish." By Alláh, ‘Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him; he observed (the orders of) Alláh's Book strictly.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin AzZubair {#6:167 .italic}

(The Verse) "Hold to forgiveness; command what is right..." was revealed by Alláh except in connection with the character of the people. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair said: Alláh ordered His Prophet to forgive the people their misbehavior (towards him).

While I was praying, Alláh's Apostle passed me and called me, but I did not go to him until I had finished the prayer. Then I went to him, and he said, "What prevented you from coming to me? Didn't Alláh say: "O you who believe! Answer the call of Alláh (by obeying Him) and His Apostle when He calls you?" He then said, "I will inform you of the greatest Sura in the Qur’án before I leave (the mosque)." When Alláh's Apostle got ready to leave (the mosque), I reminded him. He said, "It is: 'Praise be to Alláh, the Lord of the worlds.' (i.e. Surat-al-Fatiha) As-sab'a Al-Mathani (the seven repeatedly recited Verses)."

Abu Jahl said, "O Alláh! If this (Qur’án) is indeed the Truth from You, then rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky or bring on us a painful torment." So Alláh revealed: "But Alláh would not punish them while you were amongst them, nor He will punish them while they seek (Alláh's) forgiveness..." (8.33) And why Alláh should not punish them while they turn away (men) from Al-Masjid-al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque of Mecca)..." (8.33-34)

Abu Jahl said, "O Alláh! If this (Qur’án) is indeed the Truth from You), then rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky or bring on us a painful punishment."

And why Alláh should not punish them while they stop (men) from Al-Masjid-al-Haram ..' (8.33-34)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:173 .italic}

That a man came to him (while two groups of Muslims were fighting) and said, "O Abu 'Abdur Rahman! Don't you hear what Alláh has mentioned in His Book: 'And if two groups of believers fight against each other...' (49.9) So what prevents you from fighting as Alláh has mentioned in His Book?"' Ibn ‘Umar said, "O son of my brother! I would rather be blamed for not fighting because of this Verse than to be blamed because of another Verse where Alláh says: 'And whoever kills a believer intentionally..." (4.93) Then that man said, "Alláh says: 'And fight them until there is no more afflictions (worshipping other besides Alláh) and the religion (i.e. worship) will be all for Alláh (Alone)" (8.39) Ibn ‘Umar said, "We did this during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle when the number of Muslims was small, and a man was put to trial because of his religion, the pagans would either kill or chain him; but when the Muslims increased (and Islam spread), there was no persecution." When that man saw that Ibn ‘Umar did not agree to his proposal, he said, "What is your opinion regarding ‘Alí and 'Uthman?" Ibn ‘Umar said, "What is my opinion regarding ‘Alí and 'Uthman? As for 'Uthman, Alláh forgave him and you disliked to forgive him, and ‘Alí is the cousin and son-in-law of Alláh's Apostle ." Then he pointed out with his hand and said, "And that is his daughter's (house) which you can see."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#6:174 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar came to us and a man said (to him), "What do you think about 'Qit-alal-Fitnah' (fighting caused by afflictions)." Ibn ‘Umar said (to him), "And do you understand what an affliction is? Muḥammad used to fight against the pagans, and his fighting with them was an affliction, (and his fighting was) not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:175 .italic}

When the Verse: "If there are twenty steadfast amongst you, they will overcome two hundred." (8.65) was revealed, then it became obligatory for the Muslims that one (Muslim) should not flee from ten (non-Muslims). Sufyan (the sub-narrator) once said, "Twenty (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non Muslims)." Then there was revealed: 'But now Alláh has lightened your (task)..' (8.66) So it became obligatory that one-hundred (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non-muslims). (Once Sufyan said extra, "The Verse: 'Urge the believers to the fight. If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims) ..' was revealed.) Sufyan said, "Ibn Shabrama said, "I see that this order is applicable to the obligation of enjoining good and forbidding evil."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:176 .italic}

When the Verse: 'If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims), they will overcome two-hundred (non-Muslims).' was revealed, it became hard on the Muslims when it became compulsory that one Muslim ought not to flee (in war) before ten (non-Muslims). So (Alláh) lightened the order by revealing: '(But) now Alláh has lightened your (task) for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are of you one-hundred steadfast, they will overcome (two-hundred (non-Muslims).' (8.66) So when Alláh reduced the number of enemies which Muslims should withstand, their patience and perseverance against the enemy decreased as much as their task was lightened for them.

Humaid bin 'Abdur Rahman added: Then Alláh's Apostle sent ‘Alí bin Abi Talib (after Abu Bakr) and ordered him to recite aloud in public Surat Bara'a.

We were with Hudhaifa and he said, "None remains of the people described by this Verse (9.12), "Except three, and of the hypocrites except four." A bedouin said, "You the companions of Muḥammad! Tell us (things) and we do not know that about those who break open our houses and steal our precious things? ' He (Hudhaifa) replied, "Those are Al Fussaq (rebellious wrongdoers) (not disbelievers or hypocrites).

I was in the company of the Prophet in the cave, and on seeing the traces of the pagans, I said, "O Alláh's Apostle If one of them (pagans) should lift up his foot, he will see us." He said, "What do you think of two, the third of whom is Alláh?"

Narrated by Ibn Abi Mulaika {#6:186 .italic}

When there happened the disagreement between Ibn Az-Zubair and Ibn ‘Abbás, I said (to the latter), "(Why don't you take the oath of allegiance to him as) his father is Az-Zubair, and his mother is Asmá’,' and his aunt is 'Aisha, and his maternal grandfather is Abu Bakr, and his grandmother is Safiya?"

Narrated by Ibn Abi Mulaika {#6:187 .italic}

There was a disagreement between them (i.e. Ibn ‘Abbás and Ibn Az-Zubair) so I went to Ibn ‘Abbás in the morning and said (to him), "Do you want to fight against Ibn Zubair and thus make lawful what Alláh has made unlawful (i.e. fighting in Meccas?" Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Alláh forbid! Alláh ordained that Ibn Zubair and Bani Umaiya would permit (fighting in Mecca), but by Alláh, I will never regard it as permissible." Ibn ‘Abbás added. "The people asked me to take the oath of allegiance to Ibn AzZubair. I said, 'He is really entitled to assume authority for his father, Az-Zubair was the helper of the Prophet, his (maternal) grandfather, Abu Bakr was (the Prophet's) companion in the cave, his mother, Asmá’ was 'Dhatun-Nitaq', his aunt, 'Aisha was the mother of the Believers, his paternal aunt, Khadija was the wife of the Prophet , and the paternal aunt of the Prophet was his grandmother. He himself is pious and chaste in Islam, well versed in the Knowledge of the Qur’án. By Alláh! (Really, I left my relatives, Bani Umaiya for his sake though) they are my close relatives, and if they should be my rulers, they are equally apt to be so and are descended from a noble family.

Narrated by Ibn Abi Mulaika {#6:188 .italic}

We entered upon Ibn ‘Abbás and he said "Are you not astonished at Ibn Az-Zubair's assuming the caliphate?" I said (to myself), "I will support him and speak of his good traits as I did not do even for Abu Bakr and ‘Umar though they were more entitled to receive al I good than he was." I said "He (i.e Ibn Az-Zubair) is the son of the aunt of the Prophet and the son of AzZubair, and the grandson of Abu Bakr and the son of Khadija's brother, and the son of 'Aisha's sister." Nevertheless, he considers himself to be superior to me and does not want me to be one of his friends. So I said, "I never expected that he would refuse my offer to support him, and I don't think he intends to do me any good, therefore, if my cousins should inevitably be my rulers, it will be better for me to be ruled by them than by some others."

Narrated by Abu Said {#6:189 .italic}

Something was sent to the Prophet and he distributed it amongst four (men) and said, "I want to attract their hearts,(to Islam thereby)," A man said (to the Prophet ), "You have not done justice."

Narrated by Abu Musud {#6:190 .italic}

When we were ordered to give alms, we began to work as porters (to earn something we could give in charity). Abu Uqail came with one half of a Sa (special measure for food grains) and another person brought more than he did. So the hypocrites said, "Alláh is not in need of the alms of this (i.e. 'Uqail); and this other person did not give alms but for showing off." Then Alláh revealed: 'Those who criticize such of the Believers who give charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity except what is available to them.' (9.79)

Narrated by Shaqiq {#6:191 .italic}

Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari said, "Alláh's Apostle, used to order us to give alms. So one of us would exert himself to earn one Mud (special measure of wheat or dates, etc.,) to give in charity; while today one of us may have one hundred thousand." Shaqiq said: As if Abu Masud referred to himself.

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Ubai died, his son ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abdu’lláh came to Alláh's Apostle and asked him to give him his shirt in order to shroud his father in it. He gave it to him and then ‘Abdu’lláh asked the Prophet to offer the funeral prayer for him (his father). Alláh's Apostle got up to offer the funeral prayer for him, but ‘Umar got up too and got hold of the garment of Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle Will you offer the funeral prayer for him though your Lord has forbidden you to offer the prayer for him" Alláh's Apostle said, "But Alláh has given me the choice by saying: '(Whether you) ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times..' (9.80) so I will ask more than seventy times." ‘Umar said, "But he (‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Ubai) is a hypocrite!" However, Alláh's Apostle did offer the funeral prayer for him whereupon Alláh revealed: 'And never (O Muḥammad) pray for anyone of them that dies, nor stand at his grave.' (9.84)

Narrated by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab {#6:193 .italic}

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul died, Alláh's Apostle was called in order to offer the funeral prayer for him. When Alláh's Apostle got up (to offer the prayer) I jumped towards him and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do you offer the prayer for Ibn Ubai although he said so-and-so on such-and-such-a day?" I went on mentioning his sayings. Alláh's Apostle smiled and said, "Keep away from me, O ‘Umar!" But when I spoke too much to him, he said, "I have been given the choice, and I have chosen (this) ; and if I knew that if I asked forgiveness for him more than seventy times, he would be for given, I would ask it for more times than that." So Alláh's Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and then left, but he did not stay long before the two Verses of Surat-Bara'a were revealed, i.e.: 'And never (O Muḥammad) pray for anyone of them that dies.... and died in a state of rebellion.' (9.84) Later I was astonished at my daring to speak like that to Alláh's Apostle and Alláh and His Apostle know best.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#6:194 .italic}

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai died, his son ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abdu’lláh came to Alláh's Apostle who gave his shirt to him and ordered him to shroud his father in it. Then he stood up to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased, but ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab took hold of his garment and said, "Do you offer the funeral prayer for him though he was a hypocrite and Alláh has forbidden you to ask forgiveness for hypocrites?" The Prophet said, "Alláh has given me the choice (or Alláh has informed me) saying: "Whether you, O Muḥammad, ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them, even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Alláh will not forgive them," (9.80) The he added, "I will (appeal to Alláh for his sake) more than seventy times." So Alláh's Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and we too, offered the prayer along with him. Then Alláh revealed: "And never, O Muḥammad, pray (funeral prayer) for anyone of them that dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Alláh and His Apostle and died in a state of rebellion." (9.84)

I heard Ka'b bin Malik at the time he remained behind and did not join (the battle of) Tabuk, saying, "By Alláh, no blessing has Alláh bestowed upon me, besides my guidance to Islam, better than that of helping me speak the truth to Alláh's Apostle otherwise I would have told the Prophet a lie and would have been ruined like those who had told a lie when the Divine Inspiration was revealed: "They will swear by Alláh to you (Muslims) when you return to them.. the rebellious people."

Alláh's Apostle said, "Tonight two (visitors) came to me (in my dream) and took me to a town built with gold bricks and silver bricks. There we met men who, half of their bodies, look like the most-handsome human beings you have ever seen, and the other half, the ugliest human beings you have ever seen. Those two visitors said to those men, 'Go and dip yourselves in that river. So they dipped themselves therein and then came to us, their ugliness having disappeared and they were in the most-handsome shape. The visitors said, 'The first is the Garden of Eden and that is your dwelling place.' Then they added, 'As for those people who were half ugly and half handsome, they were those who mixed good deeds and bad deeds, but Alláh forgave them."

Narrated by Al-Musaiyab {#6:197 .italic}

When Abu Talib's death approached, the Prophet went to him while Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Umaiya were present with him. The Prophet said, "O uncle, say: None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, so that I may argue for your case with it before Alláh." On that, Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abu Umaiya said, "O Abu Talib! Do you want to renounce ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib's religion?" Then the Prophet said, "I will keep on asking (Alláh for) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so." Then there was revealed: 'It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Alláh) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.' (9.113)

I heard Ka'b bin Malik talking about the Verse: 'And to the three (He also forgave) who remained behind.' (9.118) saying in the last portion of his talk, "(I said), 'As a part (sign) of my repentance, I would like to give up all my property in the cause of Alláh and His Apostle,' The Prophet said to me, 'Keep some of your wealth as it is good for you." (To the three (He also forgave) who remained behind till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened..." (9.118)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Kab {#6:199 .italic}

I heard Ka'b bin Malik who was one of the three who were forgiven, saying that he had never remained behind Alláh's Apostle in any Ghazwa which he had fought except two Ghazwat Ghazwat-al'Usra (Tabuk) and Ghazwat-Badr. He added. "I decided to tell the truth to Alláh's Apostle in the forenoon, and scarcely did he return from a journey he made, except in the forenoon, he would go first to the mosque and offer a two-Rak'at prayer. The Prophet forbade others to speak to me or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the Prophet would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Alláh's Apostle might die and I would be left in that social status among the people that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But Alláh revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet in the last third of the night while Alláh's Apostle was with Um Salama. Um Salama sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Alláh's Apostle said, 'O Um Salama! Ka'b has been forgiven!' She said, 'Shall I send someone to him to give him the good tidings?' He said, 'If you did so, the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.' So when the Prophet had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Alláh's Forgiveness for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon whenever he was pleased. When Alláh revealed His Forgiveness for us, we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet lies and remained behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be described with. Alláh said: 'They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. Alláh has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you. Alláh and His Apostle will observe your actions." (9.94)

I heard Ka'b bin Malik talking about the story of the battle of Tabuk when he remained behind, "By Alláh, I do not know anyone whom Alláh has helped for telling the truth more than me since I mentioned that truth to Alláh's Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. And Alláh revealed to His Apostle: "Verily! Alláh has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin... and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)." (9.117-119) (See Ḥadít_h No. 702 Vol 5).

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari {#6:201 .italic}

Who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra' were killed). ‘Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, ‘Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra' (those who know the Qur’án by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur’án may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur’án." Abu Bakr added, "I said to ‘Umar, 'How can I do something which Alláh's Apostle has not done?' ‘Umar said (to me), 'By Alláh, it is (really) a good thing.' So ‘Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Alláh opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as ‘Umar." (Zaid bin Thabit added:) ‘Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). "You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Alláh's Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur’án and collect it (in one manuscript). " By Alláh, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur’án. I said to both of them, "How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?" Abu Bakr said, "By Alláh, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Alláh opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. So I started locating Qur’ánic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were): "Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muḥammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muḥammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)" (9.128) The manuscript on which the Qur’án was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Alláh took him unto Him, and then with ‘Umar till Alláh took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, ‘Umar's daughter.

When the Prophet arrived at Medina, the Jews were observing the fast on 'Ashura' (10th of Muharram) and they said, "This is the day when Moses became victorious over Pharaoh," On that, the Prophet said to his companions, "You (Muslims) have more right to celebrate Moses' victory than they have, so observe the fast on this day."

That he heard Ibn ‘Abbás reciting: "No doubt! They fold up their breasts." (11.5) and asked him about its explanation. He said, "Some people used to hide themselves while answering the call of nature in an open space lest they be exposed to the sky, and also when they had sexual relation with their wives in an open space lest they be exposed to the sky, so the above revelation was sent down regarding them."

Narrated by Muḥammad bin ‘Abbás bin Ja'far {#6:204 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás recited. "No doubt! They fold up their breasts." I said, "O Abu ‘Abbás! What is meant by "They fold up their breasts?"

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh said, 'Spend (O man), and I shall spend on you." He also said, "Alláh's Hand is full, and (its fullness) is not affected by the continuous spending night and day." He also said, "Do you see what He has spent since He created the Heavens and the Earth? Nevertheless, what is in His Hand is not decreased, and His Throne was over the water; and in His Hand there is the balance (of justice) whereby He raises and lowers (people)."

Narrated by Safwan bin Muhriz {#6:207 .italic}

While Ibn ‘Umar was performing the Tawaf (around the Ka'ba), a man came up to him and said, "O Abu 'AbdurRahman!" or said, "O Ibn ‘Umar! Did you hear anything from the Prophet about An-Najwa?" Ibn ‘Umar said, "I heard the Prophet saying, 'The Believer will be brought near his Lord." (Hisham, a sub-narrator said, reporting the Prophet's words), "The believer will come near (his Lord) till his Lord covers him with His screen and makes him confess his sins. (Alláh will ask him), 'Do you know (that you did) 'such-and-such sin?" He will say twice, 'Yes, I do.' Then Alláh will say, 'I concealed it in the world and I forgive it for you today.' Then the record of his good deeds will be folded up. As for the others, or the disbelievers, it will be announced publicly before the witnesses: 'These are ones who lied against their Lord."

Narrated by Ibn Masud {#6:209 .italic}

A man kissed a woman and then came to Alláh's Apostle and told him of that, so this Divine Inspiration was revealed to the Prophet 'And offer Prayers perfectly at the two ends of the day, and in some hours of the night; (i.e. (five) compulsory prayers). Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (small sins) That is a reminder for the mindful.' (11.114) The man said, Is this instruction for me only?' The Prophet said, "It is for all those of my followers who encounter a similar situation."

They said, "We do not ask you about that." He said, "Then the most honorable of the people is Joseph, Alláh's prophet, the son of Alláh's prophet, the son of Alláh's prophet, the son of Alláh's Khalil i.e. Abraham) They said, "We do not ask you about that." The Prophet said, Do you ask about (the virtues of the ancestry of the Arabs?" They said, "Yes," He said, "Those who were the best amongst you in the Pre-lslamic Period are the best amongst you in Islam if they comprehend (the Islamic religion).

Each of them related a part of the narration (wherein) the Prophet said (to 'Aisha). "If you are innocent, then Alláh will declare your innocence: but if you have committed a sin, then ask for Alláh's Forgiveness and repent to him." 'Aisha said, "By Alláh, I find no example for my case except that of Joseph's father (when he said), 'So (for me) patience is most fitting.' " Then Alláh revealed the ten Verses: "Verily those who spread the slander are a gang amongst you..." (24.11)

Who was 'Aisha's mother: While I was with 'Aisha, 'Aisha got fever, whereupon the Prophet said, "Probably her fever is caused by the story related by the people (about her)." I said, "Yes." Then 'Aisha sat up and said, "My example and your example is similar to that of Jacob and his sons: 'Nay, but your minds have made up a tale. So (for me) patience is most fitting.

When the Prophet realized that the Quraish had delayed in embracing Islam, he said, "O Alláh! Protect me against their evil by afflicting them with seven (years of famine) like the seven years of (Prophet) Joseph." So they were struck with a year of famine that destroyed everything till they had to eat bones, and till a man would look towards the sky and see something like smoke between him and it. Alláh said: "Then watch you (O Muḥammad) for the day when the sky will produce a kind of smoke plainly visible." (44.10) And Alláh further said: "Verily! We shall withdraw the punishment a little, Verily you will return (to disbelief)." (44.15) (Will Alláh relieve them from torture on the Day of Resurrection?) (The punishment of) the smoke had passed and Al-Baltsha (the destruction of the pagans in the Badr battle) had passed too.

Alláh's Apostle said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on (Prophet) Lot.

(12.110) she told him (its meaning), 'Urwa added, "I said, 'Did they (Apostles) suspect that they were betrayed (by Alláh) or that they were treated as liars by (their people)?' 'Aisha said, '(They suspected) that they were treated as liars by (their people),' I said, 'But they were sure that their people treated them as liars and it was not a matter of suspicion.' She said, 'Yes, upon my life they were sure about it.' I said to her. 'So they (Apostles) suspected that they were betrayed (by Alláh).' She said, "Alláh forbid! The Apostles never suspected their Lord of such a thing.' I said, 'What about this Verse then?' She said, 'It is about the Apostles' followers who believed in their Lord and trusted their Apostles, but the period of trials was prolonged and victory was delayed till the Apostles gave up all hope of converting those of the people who disbelieved them and the Apostles thought that their followers treated them as liars; thereupon Alláh's help came to them.

While we were with Alláh's Apostle he said, "Tell me of a tree which resembles a Muslim man. Its leaves do not fall and it does not, and does not, and does not, and it gives its fruits every now and then." It came to my mind that such a tree must be the date palm, but seeing Abu Bakr and ‘Umar saying nothing, I disliked to speak. So when they did not say anything, Alláh's Apostle said, "It is the date-palm tree." When we got up (from that place), I said to ‘Umar, "O my father! By Alláh, it came to my mind that it must be the date palm tree." ‘Umar said, "What prevented you from speaking" I replied, "I did not see you speaking, so I misliked to speak or say anything." ‘Umar then said, "If you had said it, it would have been dearer to me than so-and-so."

The Prophet said, "When Alláh has ordained some affair in the Heaven, the angels beat with their wings in obedience to His statement, which sounds like a chain dragged over a rock." (‘Alí and other sub-narrators said, "The sound reaches them.") "Until when fear is banished from their (angels) hearts, they (angels) say, 'What was it that your Lord said? They say, 'The truth; And He is the Most High, the Most Great.' (34.23) Then those who gain a hearing by stealing (i.e. devils) will hear Alláh's Statement: 'Those who gain a hearing by stealing, (stand one over the other like this). (Sufyan, to illustrate this, spread the fingers of his right hand and placed them one over the other horizontally.) A flame may overtake and burn the eavesdropper before conveying the news to the one below him; or it may not overtake him till he has conveyed it to the one below him, who in his turn, conveys it to the one below him, and so on till they convey the news to the earth. (Or probably Sufyan said, "Till the news reaches the earth.") Then the news is inspired to a sorcerer who would add a hundred lies to it. His prophecy will prove true (as far as the heavenly news is concerned). The people will say. 'Didn't he tell us that on such-and-such a day, such-and-such a thing will happen? We have found that is true because of the true news heard from heaven."

While I was praying, the Prophet passed by and called me, but I did not go to him till I had finished my prayer. When I went to him, he said, "What prevented you from coming?" I said, "I was praying." He said, "Didn't Alláh say" "O you who believes Give your response to Alláh (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle." (8.24) Then he added, "Shall I tell you the most superior Sura in the Qur’án before I go out of the mosque?" When the Prophet intended to go out (of the Mosque), I reminded him and he said, "That is: "Alhamdu-lillahi Rabbil-'Alamin (Surat-al-fatiha)' which is the seven oft repeated verses (Al-Mathani) and the Grand Qur’án which has been given to me."

Some (cooked) meat was brought to Alláh Apostle and the meat of a forearm was presented to him as he used to like it. He ate a morsel of it and said, "I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know the reason for it? Alláh will gather all the human being of early generations as well as late generation on one plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand. Then the people will say, 'Don't you see to what state you have reached? Won't you look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord' Some people will say to some others, 'Go to Adam.' So they will go to Adam and say to him. 'You are the father of mankind; Alláh created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His Spirit (meaning the spirit which he created for you); and ordered the angels to prostrate before you; so (please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are? Don't you see what condition we have reached?' Adam will say, 'Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need for intercession). Go to someone else; go to Noah.' So they will go to Noah and say (to him), 'O Noah! You are the first (of Alláh's Messengers) to the people of the earth, and Alláh has named you a thankful slave; please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?' He will say.' Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Abraham.' They will go to Abraham and say, 'O Abraham! You are Alláh's Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?' He will say to them, 'My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. I had told three lies (Abu Haiyan (the sub-narrator) mentioned them in the Ḥadít_h) Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Moses.' The people will then go to Moses and say, 'O Moses! You art Alláh's Apostle and Alláh gave you superiority above the others with this message and with His direct Talk to you; (please) intercede for us with your Lord Don't you see in what state we are?' Moses will say, 'My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before, nor will become thereafter, I killed a person whom I had not been ordered to kill. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Jesus.' So they will go to Jesus and say, 'O Jesus! You are Alláh's Apostle and His Word which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?' Jesus will say. 'My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say, 'Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muḥammad.' So they will come to me and say, 'O Muḥammad ! You are Alláh's Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Alláh forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don't you see in what state we are?" The Prophet added, "Then I will go beneath Alláh's Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Alláh will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, 'O Muḥammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your intercession) will be accepted.' So I will raise my head and Say, 'My followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord'. It will be said, 'O Muḥammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they will share the other gates with the people." The Prophet further said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham)."

Some of them said, "What urges you to ask him about it" Others said, "(Don't) lest he should give you a reply which you dislike." But they said, "Ask him." So they asked him about the Spirit. The Prophet kept quiet and did not give them any answer. I knew that he was being divinely inspired so I stayed at my place. When the divine inspiration had been revealed, the Prophet said. "They ask you (O, Muḥammad) concerning the Spirit, Say: "The spirit," its knowledge is with my Lord; and of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a Little." (17.85)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:246 .italic}

(Regarding): 'Neither say your, prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.' (17.110) This Verse was revealed while Alláh's Apostle was hiding himself in Mecca. When he prayed with his companions, he used to raise his voice with the recitation of Qur’án, and if the pagans happened to hear him, they would abuse the Qur’án, the One who revealed it and the one who brought it. Therefore Alláh said to His Prophet : 'Neither say your prayer aloud.' (17.110) i.e. do not recite aloud lest the pagans should hear you, but follow a way between.

I said to Ibn ‘Abbás, "Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not the Moses of the children of Israel" Ibn ‘Abbás said, "The enemy of Alláh (Nauf) told a lie." Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b that he heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Moses got up to deliver a speech before the children of Israel and he was asked, Who is the most learned person among the people?' Moses replied, 'I (am the most learned).' Alláh admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Alláh alone. So Alláh revealed to him: 'At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.' Moses asked, 'O my Lord, how can I meet him?' Alláh said, 'Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.' So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha' bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) Alláh stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night. The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant 'Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.' (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which Alláh had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,' 'Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.' (18.63) There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, 'That is what we have been seeking'. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. 'Is there such a greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' He said, 'Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?' Moses said, 'I have come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught. Al-Khadir said, 'You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Alláh's knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of Alláh's knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it." Moses said, "Alláh willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.' (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. 'If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.' These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.' (18.71) Al-Khadir said, 'Didn't I say that you can have no patience with me ?' (18.72) Moses said, 'Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)" (18.73) Alláh's Apostle said, "The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, 'My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Alláh's knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.' Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, 'Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.' (18.74) He said, "Didn't I tell you that you can have no patience with me?' (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, 'If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.' (18.76) Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, 'These are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, 'This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.' (18.78-82) Alláh's Apostle said, "We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Alláh might have described to us more about their story."

Ya'la bin Muslim and 'Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Said bin Jubair. Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn ‘Abbás, Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Ask me (any question)" I said, "O Abu ‘Abbás! May Alláh let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir's companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel." As for 'Amr, he said to me, "Ibn ‘Abbás said, "(Nauf) the enemy of Alláh told a lie." But Ya'la said to me, "Ibn ‘Abbás said, Ubai bin Ka'b said, Alláh's Apostle said, 'Once Moses, Alláh's Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?' Moses replied, 'No.' So Alláh admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Alláh. It was said, (on behalf of Alláh), 'Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).' Moses said, 'O my Lord! Where is he?' Alláh said, 'At the junction of the two seas.' Moses said, 'O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.' " 'Amr said to me, Alláh said, "That place will be where the fish will leave you." Ya'la said to me, "Alláh said (to Moses), 'Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.' " So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant "I don't want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you." He said (to Moses)." You have not demanded too much." And that is as mentioned by Alláh: 'And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant .... ' (18.60) Yusha' bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, "While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), "I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Alláh stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. 'Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, "Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock." Moses said "We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours." (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. 'Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, 'Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' Al-Khadir said, 'Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes.' Al-Khadir said, "What do you want?' Moses said, ' I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.' Al-Khadir said, 'Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, 'By Alláh, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Alláh's Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious slave of Alláh.' (We said to Said "Was that Khadir?" He said, "Yes.") The boat men said, 'We will not get him on board with fare.' Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, 'Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. "Moses said so protestingly.") Al-Khadir said, didn't I say that you can have no patience with me?' (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, 'Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).' (18.73) (Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya'la- said: Said said 'They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, 'Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody' (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said 'Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya'la said, 'I think Said said, 'Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), 'If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, 'Wages that we might had eaten.' And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them" (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn ‘Abbás recited: 'In front of them (was) a king.' It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. 'A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. 'His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.' (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, 'so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy' (18:81). This was in reply to Moses' saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.'? (18.74). 'Near to mercy" means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa‘íd, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi 'Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.

I said to Ibn ‘Abbás, "Nauf-al-Bakali " claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Alláh's enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka'b narrated to us that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, 'Who is the most learned person among the people?' Moses replied, 'I (am the most learned).' Alláh then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Alláh only (Then) came the Divine Inspiration: 'Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.' Moses said, 'O my Lord ! How can meet him?' Alláh said, 'Take a fish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha' bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than 'Amr said) 'At the rock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early meal' (18.62). The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, 'Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish ...' (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, 'Is there any such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The man said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes,' and added, 'may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?' (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, 'O Moses! You have something of Alláh's knowledge which Alláh has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Alláh's knowledge which Alláh has taught me and which you do not know.' Moses said, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. 'My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation's knowledge compared to Alláh's knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow's beak.' Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, 'These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown them. Surely you have...' (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, 'Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! ' (18.74) He said, "Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.' (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, 'When we entered this town, they neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,' Al-Khadir said, 'This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you were unable to hold patience.'...(18.78) Alláh's Apostle said, 'We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Alláh) could have described to us more about their story.' Ibn ‘Abbás used to recite: 'And in front (ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) ...and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. "

'Uwaimir came to 'Asim bin 'Adi who was the chief of Bani Ajlan and said, "What do you say about a man who has found another man with his wife? Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (i.e. the husband), or what should he do? Please ask Alláh's Apostle about this matter on my behalf." Asim then went to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! (And asked him that question) but Alláh's Apostle disliked the question," When 'Uwaimir asked 'Asim (about the Prophet's answer) 'Asim replied that Alláh's Apostle disliked such questions and considered it shameful. "Uwaimir then said, "By Alláh, I will not give up asking unless I ask Alláh's Apostle about it." Uwaimir came (to the Prophet ) and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! A man has found another man with his wife! Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (the husband, in Qisas) or what should he do?" Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh has revealed regarding you and your wife's case in the Qur’án "So Alláh's Apostle ordered them to perform the measures of Mula'ana according to what Alláh had mentioned in His Book. So 'Uwaimir did Mula'ana with her and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If I kept her I would oppress her." So 'Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a tradition after them for those who happened to be involved in a case of Mula'ana. Alláh's Apostle then said, "Look! If she (Uwaimir's wife) delivers a black child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat legs, then I will be of the opinion that 'Uwaimir has spoken the truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we will consider that 'Uwaimir has told a lie against her." Later on she delivered a child carrying the qualities which Alláh's Apostle had mentioned as a proof for 'Uwaimir's claim; therefore the child was ascribed to its mother henceforth.

Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him whereupon you might kill him (i.e. the killer) (in Qisas) or what should he do?" So Alláh revealed concerning their case what is mentioned of the order of Mula'ana. Alláh's Apostle said to the man, "The matter between you and your wife has been decided." So they did Mula'ana in the presence of Alláh's Apostle and I was present there, and then the man divorced his wife. So it became a tradition to dissolve the marriage of those spouses who were involved in a case of Mula'ana. The woman was pregnant and the husband denied that he was the cause of her pregnancy, so the son was (later) ascribed to her. Then it became a tradition that such a son would be the heir of his mother, and she would inherit of him what Alláh prescribed for her.

Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma' and filed the case before the Prophet. The Prophet said (to Hilal), "Either you bring forth a proof (four witnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back." Hilal said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If anyone of us saw a man over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?" The Prophet kept on saying, "Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back." Hilal then said, "By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am telling the truth and Alláh will reveal to you what will save my back from legal punishment." Then Gabriel came down and revealed to him: 'As for those who accuse their wives...' (24.6-9) The Prophet recited it till he reached: '... (her accuser) is telling the truth.' Then the Prophet left and sent for the woman, and Hilal went (and brought) her and then took the oaths (confirming the claim). The Prophet was saying, "Alláh knows that one of you is a liar, so will any of you repent?" Then the woman got up and took the oaths and when she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, "It (the fifth oath) will definitely bring Alláh's curse on you (if you are guilty)." So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking the oath) so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then she said, "I will not dishonor my family all through these days," and carried on (the process of taking oaths). The Prophet then said, "Watch her; if she delivers a black-eyed child with big hips and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma's child." Later she delivered a child of that description. So the Prophet said, "If the case was not settled by Alláh's Law, I would punish her severely."

A man accused his wife of illegal sexual intercourse and denied his paternity to her (conceived) child during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle ordered them both to do Mula'ana as Alláh decreed and then gave his decision that the child would be for the mother, and a divorce decree was issued for the couple involved in a case of Mula'ana.

And as for him among them who had the greater share..' (24.11) was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:274 .italic}

(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Alláh's Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Alláh's Apostle after Alláh's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Alláh's Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Alláh's Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: "Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun," which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Alláh, he did not say to me a single word except, "Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun," till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Alláh's Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Alláh's Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, "How is that (lady)?" and then depart. That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, "Let Mistah be ruined ! " I said to her, "What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, "O you there! Didn't you hear what he has said?" I said, "And what did he say?" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Alláh's Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, "How is that (lady)?" I said, "Will you allow me to go to my parents?" At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Alláh's Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, "O my mother! What are the people talking about?" My mother said, "O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Alláh, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her." I said, "Subhan Alláh! Did the people really talk about that?" That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Alláh's Apostle called ‘Alí bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Alláh's Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good." But ‘Alí bin Abi Talib said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth." 'Aisha added: So Alláh's Apostle called for Barira and said, "O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, "By Alláh Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it." So Alláh's Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul then. Alláh's Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, "O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Alláh, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me," Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it." On that, Sad bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), "By Alláh the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!" On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin 'Ubada, "You are a liar! By Alláh the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!" So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Alláh's Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Alláh's Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Alláh's Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Alláh's Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, "Thereafter, O 'Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Alláh will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Alláh's forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Alláh, Alláh accepts his repentance." When Alláh's Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, "Reply to Alláh's Apostle on my behalf as to what he said." He said, "By Alláh, I do not know what to say to Alláh's Apostle." Then I said to my mother, "Reply to Alláh's Apostle." She said, "I do not know what to say to Alláh's Apostle." Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Qur’án, I said, "By Alláh, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Alláh knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Alláh knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Alláh, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph's father: "So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Alláh (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Alláh would reveal my innocence. But by Alláh, I never thought that Alláh would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Alláh with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Alláh's Apostle might have a vision in which Alláh would prove my innocence. By Alláh, Alláh's Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Alláh's Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Alláh's Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, "Aisha, Alláh has declared your innocence." My mother said to me, "Get up and go to him." I said, "By Alláh, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Alláh." So Alláh revealed: "Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not...." (24.11-20). When Alláh revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, "By Alláh, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha". So Alláh revealed: "Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Alláh's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Alláh is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful." (24.22) Abu Bakr said, "Yes, by Alláh, I wish that Alláh should forgive me." So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, "By Alláh, I will never withold it from him at all." Aisha further said: Alláh's Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, "O Zainab! What have you seen?" She replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha)." Of all the wives of Alláh's Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Alláh saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.

Ibn ‘Abbás asked permission to visit Aisha before her death, and at that time she was in a state of agony. She then said. "I am afraid that he will praise me too much." And then it was said to her, "He is the cousin of Alláh's Apostle and one of the prominent Muslims." Then she said, "Allow him to enter." (When he entered) he said, "How are you?" She replied, "I am Alright if I fear (Alláh)." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Alláh willing, you are Alright as you are the wife of Alláh's Apostle and he did not marry any virgin except you and proof of your innocence was revealed from the Heaven." Later on Ibn Az-Zubair entered after him and 'Aisha said to him, "Ibn ‘Abbás came to me and praised me greatly, but I wish that I was a thing forgotten and out of sight."

'Aisha said that Ḥasan bin Thabit came and asked permission to visit her. I said, "How do you permit such a person?" She said, "Hasn't he received a severely penalty?" (Sufyan, the subnarrator, said: She meant the loss of his sight.) Thereupon Ḥasan said the following poetic verse: "A chaste pious woman who arouses no suspicion. She never talks about chaste heedless women behind their backs.' On that she said, "But you are not so."

Ḥasan came to Aisha and said the following poetic Verse: 'A chaste pious woman who arouses no suspicion. She never talks against chaste heedless women behind their backs.' 'Aisha said, "But you are not," I said (to 'Aisha), "Why do you allow such a person to enter upon you after Alláh has revealed: "...and as for him among them who had the greater share therein'?" (24.11) She said, "What punishment is worse than blindness?" She added, "And he used to defend Alláh's Apostle against the pagans (in his poetry).

Narrated by Aisha {#6:281 .italic}

When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Alláh's Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Alláh as He deserved, he said, "To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Alláh, I do not know anything bad about her. By Alláh, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me." Sad bin Mu'adh got up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle Allow me to chop their heads off" Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa'd bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Ḥasan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu'adh), "You have told a lie! By Alláh, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off." It was probable that some evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, "Let Mistah. be ruined" I said to her, "O mother Why do you abuse your Son" On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, "Let Mistah be ruined" I said to her, "Why do you abuse your son?" She stumbled for the third time and said, "Let Mistah be ruined" whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, "By Alláh, I do not abuse him except because of you." I asked her, "Concerning what of my affairs?" So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, "Has this really happened?" She replied, "Yes, by Alláh." I returned to my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said to Alláh's Apostle "Send me to my father's house." So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, "What has brought you, O (my) daughter?" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, "O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her." But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), "Does my father know about it?" She said, "yes" I asked, Does Alláh's Apostle know about it too?" She said, "Yes, Alláh's Apostle does too." So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, "What is the matter with her? " She said, "She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk)." On that Abú- Bakr wept and said, "I beseech you by Alláh, O my daughter, to go back to your home" I went back to my home and Alláh's Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, "By Alláh, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough." On that, some of the Prophet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, "Tell the truth to Alláh's Apostle." Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, "Subhan Alláh! By Alláh, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold." Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said, "Subhan Alláh! By Alláh, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman." Later that man was martyred in Alláh's Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Alláh's Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and glorified Alláh and said, "Now then O 'Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Alláh as Alláh accepts the repentance from his slaves." An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). "Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Alláh's Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, "What should I say?" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, "What should I say?" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, "I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, and that Muḥammad is His Apostle!" And after praising and glorifying Alláh as He deserves, I said, "Now then, by Alláh, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Alláh is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Alláh knows that I have not done it, then you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty." By Alláh, 'I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he said; So (for me) "Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Alláh (alone) whose help can be sought.' At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Alláh's Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, "Have the good tidings O ' "Aisha! Alláh has revealed your innocence." At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. "Get up and go to him." I said, "By Alláh, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Alláh Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me)," (Aisha used to say:) "But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Alláh protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Ḥasan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Alláh revealed the Divine Verse: "Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Alláh should forgive you? And Alláh if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (24.22) On that, Abu Bakr said, "Yes, by Alláh, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us." So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.

I or somebody, asked Alláh's Apostle "Which is the biggest sin in the Sight of Alláh?" He said, "That you set up a rival (in worship) to Alláh though He Alone created you." I asked, "What is next?" He said, "Then, that you kill your son, being afraid that he may share your meals with you." I asked, "What is next?" He said, "That you commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor." Then the following Verse was revealed to confirm the statement of Alláh's Apostle: "Those who invoke not with Alláh, any other god, nor kill life as Alláh has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse." (25.68)

Narrated by Al-Qasim bin Abi Bazza {#6:285 .italic}

That he asked Said bin Jubair, "Is there any repentance of the one who has murdered a believer intentionally?" Then I recited to him: "Nor kill such life as Alláh has forbidden except for a just cause." Said said, "I recited this very Verse before Ibn ‘Abbás as you have recited it before me. Ibn ‘Abbás said, 'This Verse was revealed in Mecca and it has been abrogated by a Verse in Surat-An-Nisa which was later revealed in Medina."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#6:286 .italic}

The people of Kufa differed as regards the killing of a believer so I entered upon Ibn ‘Abbás (and asked him) about that. Ibn ‘Abbás said, "The Verse (in Surat-An-Nisa', 4:93) was the last thing revealed in this respect and nothing cancelled its validity."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#6:287 .italic}

I asked Ibn ‘Abbás about Alláh's saying: '.. this reward is Hell Fire.' (4.93) He said, "No repentance is accepted from him (i.e. the murderer of a believer)." I asked him regarding the saying of Alláh: 'Those who invoke not with Alláh any other god.' ...(25.68) He said, "This Verse was revealed concerning the pagans of the pre-lslamic period."

Narrated by Said bin Jubair {#6:288 .italic}

Ibn Abza said to me, "Ask Ibn ‘Abbás regarding the Statement of Alláh: 'And whoever murders a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell.' (4.69) And also His Statement: '...nor kill such life as Alláh has forbidden, except for a just cause ... except those who repent, believe, and do good deeds.' " (25.68-70) So I asked Ibn ‘Abbás and he said, "When this (25.68-69) was revealed, the people of Mecca said, "We have invoked other gods with Alláh, and we have murdered such lives which Alláh has made sacred, and we have committed illegal sexual intercourse. So Alláh revealed: 'Except those who repent, believe, and do good deeds and Alláh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.' (25.70)

Abdur-Rahman bin Abza ordered me to ask Ibn ‘Abbás regarding the two Verses (the first of which was ): "And whosoever murders a believer intentionally."

About (the other Verse): 'And those who invoke not with Alláh any other god.' he said, "It was revealed concerning the pagans."

When the Verse: 'And warn your tribe of near-kindred, was revealed, the Prophet ascended the Safa (mountain) and started calling, "O Bani Fihr! O Bani 'Adi!" addressing various tribes of Quraish till they were assembled. Those who could not come themselves, sent their messengers to see what was there. Abu Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet then said, "Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?" They said, "Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth." He then said, "I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment." Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) "May your hands perish all this day. Is it for this purpose you have gathered us?" Then it was revealed: "Perish the hands of Abu Lahab (one of the Prophet's uncles), and perish he! His wealth and his children will not profit him..." (111.1-5)

Alláh's Apostle got up when the Verse: 'And warn your tribe of near kindred..." (26.214) was revealed and said, "O Quraish people! (or he said a similar word) Buy yourselves! I cannot save you from Alláh (if you disobey Him) O Bani Abu Manaf! I cannot save you from Alláh (if you disobey Him). O ‘Abbás! The son of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib! I cannot save you from Alláh (if you disobey Him) O Safiya, (the aunt of Alláh's Apostle) I cannot save you from Alláh (if you disobey Him). O Fatima, the daughter of Muḥammad ! Ask what you wish from my property, but I cannot save you from Alláh (if you disobey Him)."

Narrated by Al-Musaiyab {#6:295 .italic}

When Abu Talib was on his death bed, Alláh's Apostle came to him and found with him, Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Umaiya bin Al-Mughira. Alláh's Apostle said, "O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, a sentence with which I will defend you before Alláh." On that Abu Jahl and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi Umaiya said to Abu Talib, "Will you now leave the religion of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib?" Alláh's Apostle kept on inviting him to say that sentence while the other two kept on repeating their sentence before him till Abu Talib said as the last thing he said to them, "I am on the religion of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib," and refused to say: None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh. On that Alláh's Apostle said, "By Alláh, I will keep on asking Alláh's forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Alláh) to do so." So Alláh revealed: 'It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Alláh) for forgiveness for pagans.' (9.113) And then Alláh revealed especially about Abu Talib: 'Verily! You (O, Muḥammad) guide not whom you like, but Alláh guides whom He will.' (28.56)

'...will bring you home' means to Mecca.

Narrated by Masruq {#6:297 .italic}

While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, "Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof." That news scared us, so I went to (‘Abdu’lláh) Ibn Mas'ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, "He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, 'Alláh knows best,' for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, 'I do not know,' if you do not know a certain thing. Alláh said to His prophet. 'Say (O Muḥammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur’án), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)' (38.86) The Qur'aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet invoked evil on them, saying, 'O Alláh! Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.' So they were afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, "O Muḥammad! You came to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Alláh (to relieve them).' Then Ibn Mas'ud recited:-- 'Then watch you for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible....but truly you will return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15) Ibn Mas'ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Alláh (threatened them thus): 'On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.' (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Alláh's saying- "Lizama" (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Alláh's Statement: 'Alif-Lam-Mim, the Romans have been defeated, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious,' (30.1-3) (This verse): Indicates that the defeat of Byzantine has already passed.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:298 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "No child is born except on Al-Fitra (Islam) and then his parents make him Jewish, Christian or Magian, as an animal produces a perfect young animal: do you see any part of its body amputated?" Then he rec 'The religion of pure Islamic Faith (Hanifa),(i.e. to worship none but Alláh), The pure Alláh's Islamic nature with which He (Alláh) has created mankind. Let There be no change in Alláh's religion (i.e. to join none in Alláh's worship). That is the straight religion; but most of men know not..." (30.30)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:299 .italic}

When there was revealed: 'It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong.' (6.82) It was very hard for the companions of Alláh's Apostle, so they said, "Which of us has not confused his belief with wrong?" Alláh's Apostle said, "The Verse does not mean this. Don't you hear Luqman's statement to his son: 'Verily! Joining others in worship, with Alláh is a great wrong indeed.' (31.13)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:300 .italic}

One day while Alláh's Apostle was sitting with the people, a man came to him walking and said, "O Alláh's Apostle. What is Belief?" The Prophet said, "Belief is to believe in Alláh, His Angels, His Books, His Apostles, and the meeting with Him, and to believe in the Resurrection." The man asked, "O Alláh's Apostle What is Islam?" The Prophet replied, "Islam is to worship Alláh and not worship anything besides Him, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the (compulsory) charity i.e. Zakat and to fast the month of Ramaḍán." The man again asked, "O Alláh's Apostle What is Ihsan (i.e. perfection or Benevolence)?" The Prophet said, "Ihsan is to worship Alláh as if you see Him, and if you do not achieve this state of devotion, then (take it for granted that) Alláh sees you." The man further asked, "O Alláh's Apostle When will the Hour be established?" The Prophet replied, "The one who is asked about it does not know more than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its portents. The Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Alláh. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Alláh (alone). He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs." (31.34) Then the man left. The Prophet said, "Call him back to me." They went to call him back but could not see him. The Prophet said, "That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion." (See hadeeth No. 47 Vol 1)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#6:301 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The keys of the Unseen are five." And then he recited: 'Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Alláh (alone).' (31.34)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:302 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh said, 'I have prepared for my pious worshipers such things as no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of, and nobody has ever thought of." Abu Huraira added: If you wish you can read: 'No soul knows what is kept hidden (in reserve) for them of joy as reward for what they used to do.' (32.17)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:303 .italic}

The Prophet, said, "Alláh said, 'I have prepared for My pious worshipers such things as no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard of, and nobody has ever thought of. All that is reserved, besides which, all that you have seen, is nothing." Then he recited: 'No soul knows what is kept hidden (in reserve) for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.' (32.17)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:304 .italic}

The Prophet said, "There is no believer but I, of all the people, I am the closest to him both in this world and in the Hereafter. Recite if you wish: 'The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.' (33.6) so if a believer (dies) leaves some property then his relatives will inherit that property; but if he is in debt or he leaves poor children, let those (creditors and children) come to me (that I may pay the debt and provide for the children), for them I am his sponsor (surely).

We used not to call Zaid bin Haritha the freed slave of Alláh's Apostle except Zaid bin Muḥammad till the Qu'anic Verse was revealed: "Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers. That is more than just in the Sight of Alláh." (33.5)

Narrated by Anas {#6:306 .italic}

We think that the Verse: 'Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Alláh.' was revealed in favor of Anas bin An-Nadir.

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#6:307 .italic}

When we collected the fragramentary manuscripts of the Qur’án into copies, I missed one of the Verses of Surat al-Ahzab which I used to hear Alláh's Apostle reading. Finally I did not find it with anybody except Khuzaima Al-Ansari, whose witness was considered by Alláh's Apostle equal to the witness of two men. (And that Verse was:) 'Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Alláh.'

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:308 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) Alláh's Apostle came to me when Alláh ordered him to give option to his wives. So Alláh's Apostle started with me, saying, "I am going to mention to you something but you should not hasten (to give your reply) unless you consult your parents.' He knew that my parents would not order me to leave him. Then he said, "Alláh says: "O Prophet! Say to your wives..." (33.28-29) On that I said to him, "Then why should I consult my parents? Verily, I seek Alláh, His Apostle and the Home of the Hereafter."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:309 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) when Alláh's Apostle was ordered to give option to his wives, he started with me, saying, "I am going to mention to you something, but you shall not hasten (to give your reply) unless you consult your parents." The Prophet knew that my parents would not order me to leave him. Then he said, "Alláh says: 'O Prophet (Muḥammad)! Say to your wives: If you desire the life of this world and its glitter...a great reward." (33.28-29) I said, "Then why I consult my parents? Verily, I seek Alláh, His Apostle and the Home of the Hereafter." Then all the other wives of the Prophet did the same as I did.

The Verse: 'But you did hide in your mind that which Alláh was about to make manifest.' (33.37) was revealed concerning Zainab bint Jahsh and Zaid bin Haritha.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:311 .italic}

I used to look down upon those ladies who had given themselves to Alláh's Apostle and I used to say, "Can a lady give herself (to a man)?" But when Alláh revealed: "You (O Muḥammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives), and you may receive any of them whom you will; and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside (temporarily).' (33.51) I said (to the Prophet), "I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires."

Narrated by Muadha {#6:312 .italic}

'Aisha said, "Alláh's Apostle used to take the permission of that wife with whom he was supposed to stay overnight if he wanted to go to one other than her, after this Verse was revealed:-- "You (O Muḥammad) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives) and you may receive any (of them) whom you will; and there is no blame on you if you invite one whose turn you have set aside (temporarily). (33.51) I asked Aisha, "What did you use to say (in this case)?" She said, "I used to say to him, "If I could deny you the permission (to go to your other wives) I would not allow your favor to be bestowed on any other person."

Narrated by ‘Umar {#6:313 .italic}

I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Good and bad persons enter upon you, so I suggest that you order the mothers of the Believers (i.e. your wives) to observe veils." Then Alláh revealed the Verses of Al-Hijab.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#6:314 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh, he invited the people to a meal. They took the meal and remained sitting and talking. Then the Prophet (showed them) as if he is ready to get up, yet they did not get up. When he noticed that (there was no response to his movement), he got up, and the others too, got up except three persons who kept on sitting. The Prophet came back in order to enter his house, but he went away again. Then they left, whereupon I set out and went to the Prophet to tell him that they had departed, so he came and entered his house. I wanted to enter along with him, but he put a screen between me and him. Then Alláh revealed: 'O you who believe! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet...' (33.53)

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#6:315 .italic}

I of all the people know best this verse of Al-Hijab. When Alláh's Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh she was with him in the house and he prepared a meal and invited the people (to it). They sat down (after finishing their meal) and started chatting. So the Prophet went out and then returned several times while they were still sitting and talking. So Alláh revealed the Verse: 'O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses until leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation ...ask them from behind a screen.' (33.53) So the screen was set up and the people went away.

Narrated by Anas {#6:316 .italic}

A banquet of bread and meat was held on the occasion of the marriage of the Prophet to Zainab bint Jahsh. I was sent to invite the people (to the banquet), and so the people started coming (in groups); They would eat and then leave. Another batch would come, eat and leave. So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite. Then I said, "O Alláh's Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite." He said, "Carry away the remaining food." Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting. The Prophet left and went towards the dwelling place of Aisha and said, "Peace and Alláh's Mercy be on you, O the people of the house!" She replied, "Peace and the mercy of Alláh be on you too. How did you find your wife? May Alláh bless you. Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him. Then the Prophet returned and found a group of three persons still in the house chatting. The Prophet was a very shy person, so he went out (for the second time) and went towards the dwelling place of 'Aisha. I do not remember whether I informed him that the people have gone away. So he returned and as soon as he entered the gate, he drew the curtain between me and him, and then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.

Narrated by Anas {#6:317 .italic}

When Alláh's Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh, he made the people eat meat and bread to their fill (by giving a Walima banquet). Then he went out to the dwelling places of the mothers of the believers (his wives), as he used to do in the morning of his marriage. He would greet them and invoke good on them, and they (too) would return his greeting and invoke good on him. When he returned to his house, he found two men talking to each other; and when he saw them, he went out of his house again. When those two men saw Alláh's Apostle: going out of his house, they quickly got up (and departed). I do not remember whether I informed him of their departure, or he was informed (by somebody else). So he returned, and when he entered the house, he lowered the curtain between me and him. Then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:318 .italic}

Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil. She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, "O Sauda! By Alláh, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Alláh's Apostle was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I went out to answer the call of nature and ‘Umar said to me so-and-so." Then Alláh inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), "You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#6:319 .italic}

Aflah, the brother of Abi Al-Quais, asked permission to visit me after the order of Al-Hijab was revealed. I said, "I will not permit him unless I take permission of the Prophet about him for it was not the brother of Abi Al-Qu'ais but the wife of Abi Al-Qu'ais that nursed me." The Prophet entered upon me, and I said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh, the brother of Abi Al-Qu'ais asked permission to visit me but I refused to permit him unless I took your permission." The Prophet said, "What stopped you from permitting him? He is your uncle." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The man was not the person who had nursed me, but the woman, the wife of Abi Al-Qu'ais had nursed me." He said, "Admit him, for he is your uncle. Taribat Yaminuki (may your right hand be saved)" 'Urwa, the sub-narrator added: For that 'Aisha used to say, "Consider those things which are illegal because of blood relations as illegal because of the corresponding foster relations."

It was said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We know how to greet you, but how to invoke Alláh for you?" The Prophet said, "Say: Allahumma salli ala Muḥammadin wa'ala ‘Alí Muḥammaddin, kama sallaita 'ala all Ibrahim, innaka Ḥamídun Majíd."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#6:321 .italic}

We said, "O Alláh's Apostle! (We know) this greeting (to you) but how shall we invoke Alláh for you?" He said, "Say!

Alláh's Apostle said, "Moses was a shy man, and that is what the Statement of Alláh means: 'O you who believe Be not like those who annoyed Moses, but Alláh proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was honorable in Alláh's Sight.' (33.69)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:324 .italic}

Alláh's Prophet said, "When Alláh decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, "What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great." (34.23). Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other." (Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers.) A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller. Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, 'Didn't he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?' So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:325 .italic}

One day the Prophet ascended Safa mountain and said, "Oh Sabah! " All the Quraish gathered round him and said, "What is the matter?" He said, Look, if I told you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, would you not believe me?" They said, "Yes, we will believe you." He said, "I am a warner to you in face of a terrible punishment." On that Abu Lahab said, "May you perish ! Is it for this thing that you have gathered us?" So Alláh revealed: 'Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!...' (111.1)

Narrated by Abu Dharr {#6:326 .italic}

Once I was with the Prophet in the mosque at the time of sunset. The Prophet said, "O Abu Dharr! Do you know where the sun sets?" I replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know best." He said, "It goes and prostrates underneath (Alláh's) Throne; and that is Alláh's Statement:-- 'And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (decreed). And that is the decree of All-Mighty, the All-Knowing....' (36.38)

Narrated by Abu Dharr {#6:327 .italic}

I asked the Prophet about the Statement of Alláh: 'And the sun runs on fixed course for a term (decreed), ' (36.38) He said, "Its course is underneath "Alláh's Throne." (Prostration of Sun trees, stars. mentioned in Qur’án and hadeeth does not mean like our prostration but it means that these objects are obedient to their Creator (Alláh) and they obey for what they have been created for).

I asked Muhajid regarding the prostration in Surat Sad. He said, "Ibn ‘Abbás was asked the same question and he said, 'Those are they (the prophets) whom Alláh had Guided. So follow their guidance." (6.90) Ibn ‘Abbás used to perform a prostration (on reading this Sura).

Narrated by Al-Awwam {#6:331 .italic}

I asked Mujahid regarding the prostration in Surat Sad. He said, "I asked Ibn ‘Abbás, 'What evidence makes you prostrate?' He said, "Don't you recite: 'And among his progeny, David and Solomon..(6.84). Those are they whom Alláh had guided. So follow their guidance.' (6.90) So David was the one of those prophets whom Prophet (Muḥammad) was ordered to follow. David prostrated, so Alláh's Apostle (Muḥammad) performed this prostration too.'

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:332 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Last night a demon from the Jinns came to me (or the Prophet said, a similar sentence) to disturb my prayer, but Alláh gave me the power to overcome him. I intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque till the morning so that all of you could see him, but then I remembered the Statement of my brother Solomon: 'My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.' (38.35) The narrator added: Then he (the Prophet) dismissed him, rejected. 'Nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).' (38.86)

Narrated by Masruq {#6:333 .italic}

We came upon ‘Abdu’lláh bin Mas'ud and he said "O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, "Alláh knows better,' for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, 'Alláh knows better.' Alláh said to His Prophet: 'Say (O Muḥammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Qur’án) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).' (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad-Dukhan (the smoke), Alláh's Apostle invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, "O Alláh! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph." So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Alláh said: 'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.' (44.10-11) (So they invoked Alláh) "Our Lord! Remove the punishment from us really we are believers." How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: 'One taught (by a human being), a madman?' 'We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).' (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?" ‘Abdu’lláh added, "The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Alláh destroyed them on the Day of Badr. Alláh said: 'The day We shall seize you with a mighty grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution." (44.16)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:334 .italic}

Some pagans who committed murders in great number and committed illegal sexual intercourse excessively, came to Muḥammad and said, "O Muḥammad! Whatever you say and invite people to, is good: but we wish if you could inform us whether we can make an expiration for our (past evil) deeds." So the Divine Verses came: 'Those who invoke not with Alláh any other god, not kill such life as Alláh has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse.' (25.68) And there was also revealed: 'Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of Alláh.' (39.53)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:335 .italic}

A (Jewish) Rabbi came to Alláh's Apostle and he said, "O Muḥammad! We learn that Alláh will put all the heavens on one finger, and the earths on one finger, and the trees on one finger, and the water and the dust on one finger, and all the other created beings on one finger. Then He will say, 'I am the King.' Thereupon the Prophet smiled so that his pre-molar teeth became visible, and that was the confirmation of the Rabbi. Then Alláh's Apostle recited: 'No just estimate have they made of Alláh such as due to Him.' (39.67)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:336 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Alláh will hold the whole earth, and roll all the heavens up in His Right Hand, and then He will say, 'I am the King; where are the kings of the earth?"'

The Prophet said, "I will be the first to raise my head after the second blowing of the trumpet and will see Moses hanging the Throne, and I will not know whether he had been in that state all the time or after the blowing of the trumpet."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:338 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Between the two blowing of the trumpet there will be forty." The people said, "O Abu Huraira! Forty days?" I refused to reply. They said, "Forty years?" I refused to reply and added: Everything of the human body will decay except the coccyx bone (of the tail) and from that bone Alláh will reconstruct the whole body.

Narrated by Urwa bin Az-Zubair {#6:339 .italic}

I asked ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr bin Al-'As to inform me of the worst thing the pagans had done to Alláh's Apostle. He said: "While Alláh's Apostle was praying in the courtyard of the ka'ba, 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait came and seized Alláh's Apostle by the shoulder and twisted his garment round his neck and throttled him severely. Abu Bakr came and seized 'Uqba's shoulder and threw him away from Alláh's Apostle and said, "Would you kill a man because he says: 'My Lord is Alláh,' and has come to you with clear Signs from your Lord?" (40.28)

Narrated by Ibn Mas'ud {#6:340 .italic}

(regarding) the Verse: 'And you have not been screening against yourself lest your ears, and your eyes and your skins should testify against you..' (41.22) While two persons from Quraish and their brother-in-law from Thaqif (or two persons from Thaqif and their brother-in-law from Quraish) were in a house, they said to each other, "Do you think that Alláh hears our talks?" Some said, "He hears a portion thereof" Others said, "If He can hear a portion of it, He can hear all of it." Then the following Verse was revealed: 'And you have not been screening against yourself lest your ears, and your eyes and your skins should testify against you...' (41.22)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:341 .italic}

There gathered near the House (i.e. the Ka'ba) two Quraishi persons and a person from Thaqif (or two persons from Thaqif and one from Quraish), and all of them with very fat bellies but very little intelligence. One of them said, "Do you think that Alláh hears what we say?" Another said, "He hears us when we talk in a loud voice, but He doesn't hear us when we talk in a low tone." The third said, "If He can hear when we talk in a loud tone, then He can also hear when we speak in a low tone." Then Alláh, the Honorable, the Majestic revealed: 'And you have not been screening against yourself lest your ears, and eyes and your skins should testify against you....' (41.22-23)

That he was asked (regarding): "Except to be kind to me for my Kinship with you.' (42.23) Said bin Zubair (who was present then) said, "It means here (to show what is due for) the relatives of Muḥammad." On that Ibn ‘Abbás said: you have hurried in giving the answer! There was no branch of the tribe of Quraish but the Prophet had relatives therein. The Prophet said, "I do not want anything from (you ) except to be Kind to me for my Kinship with you."

Five things have passed, i.e. the smoke, the defeat of the Romans, the splitting of the moon, Al-Batsha (the defeat of the infidels in the battle of Badr) and Al-Lizam (the punishment)'

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:346 .italic}

It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to obey the Prophet, he asked Alláh to afflict them with years of famine similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between him and the sky because of extreme fatigue. So Alláh revealed: 'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people; this is a painfull of torment.' (44.10-11) Then someone (Abu Sufyan) came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh to send rain for the tribes of Mudar for they are on the verge of destruction." On that the Prophet said (astonishingly) "Shall I invoke Alláh) for the tribes of Mudar? Verily, you are a brave man!" But the Prophet prayed for rain and it rained for them. Then the Verse was revealed. 'But truly you will return (to disbelief).' (44.15) (When the famine was over and) they restored prosperity and welfare, they reverted to their ways (of heathenism) whereupon Alláh revealed: 'On the Day when We shall seize you with a Mighty Grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.' (44.16) The narrator said, "That was the day of the Battle of Badr."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:347 .italic}

It is a sign of having knowledge that, when you do not know something, you say: 'Alláh knows better.' Alláh said to his Prophet: 'Say: No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur’án), nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist)' (38.86) When the Quraish troubled and stood against the Prophet he said, "O Alláh! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the seven years of Joseph." So they were stricken with a year of famine during which they ate bones and dead animals because of too much suffering, and one of them would see something like smoke between him and the sky because of hunger. Then they said: Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it was said to the Prophet (by Alláh), "If we remove it from them. they will revert to their ways (of heathenism)." So the Prophet invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Alláh punished them on the day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Alláh's Statement indicates: 'Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible...we will indeed (then) exact retribution.' (44.10).

Narrated by Masruq {#6:348 .italic}

I came upon ‘Abdu’lláh and he said, "When Alláh's Apostle invited Quraish (to Islam), they disbelieved him and stood against him. So he (the Prophet) said, "O Alláh! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years of Joseph.' So they were stricken with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they started eating dead animals, and if one of them got up he would see something like smoke between him and the sky from the severe fatigue and hunger." ‘Abdu’lláh then recited: 'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. This is a painful torment... (till he reached) ... We shall indeed remove the punishment for a while, but truly you will revert (to heathenism): (44.10-15) ‘Abdu’lláh added: "Will the punishment be removed from them on the Day of Resurrection?" He added," The severe grasp" was the Day of the Battle of Badr."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#6:349 .italic}

Alláh sent (the Prophet) Muḥammad and said: 'Say, No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur’án) nor am I one of the pretenders (i.e. a person who pretends things which do not exist). (38.68) When Alláh's Apostle saw Quraish standing against him, he said, "O Alláh! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years (of famine) of Joseph. So they were afflicted with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they ate bones and hides. (One of them said), "And they ate hides and dead animals, and (it seemed to them that) something like smoke was coming out of the earth. So Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, "O Muḥammad! Your people are on the verge of destruction! Please invoke Alláh to relieve them." So the Prophet invoked Alláh for them (and the famine disappeared). He said to them. "You will revert (to heathenism) after that." ‘Abdu’lláh then recited: 'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible...but truly you will revert (to disbelief).' He added, "Will the punishment be removed from them in the Hereafter? The smoke and the grasp and the Al-Lizam have all passed." One of the sub-narrater said, "The splitting of the moon." And another said, "The defeat of the Romans (has passed)."

(the wife of the Prophet), I never saw Alláh's Apostle laughing loudly enough to enable me to see his uvula, but he used to smile only. And whenever he saw clouds or winds, signs of deep concern would appear on his face. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! When people see clouds they usually feel happy, hoping that it would rain, while I see that when you see clouds, one could notice signs of dissatisfaction on your face." He said, "O 'Aisha! What is the guarantee for me that there will be no punishment in it, since some people were punished with a wind? Verily, some people saw (received) the punishment, but (while seeing the cloud) they said, 'This cloud will give us rain.' "

On that Alláh said, 'Will you be satisfied if I bestow My favors on him who keeps your ties, and withhold My favors from him who severs your ties?' On that it said, 'Yes, O my Lord!' Then Alláh said, 'That is for you.' " Abu Huraira added: If you wish, you can recite: "Would you then if you were given the authority. do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship.

He asked again, but he did not reply, and then he asked (for the third time) but he did not reply. On that, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said to himself, "Thakilat Ummu ‘Umar (May ‘Umar's mother lose her son)! I asked Alláh's Apostle three times but he did not reply." ‘Umar then said, "I made my camel run faster and went ahead of the people, and I was afraid that some Qur’ánic Verses might be revealed about me. But before getting involved in any other matter. I heard somebody calling me. I said to myself, 'I fear that some Qur’ánic Verses have been revealed about me,' and so I went to Alláh's Apostle and greeted him. He (Alláh's Apostle ) said, 'Tonight a Sura has been revealed to me, and it is dearer to me than that on which the sun rises (i.e. the world)' Then he recited: "Verily, We have given you a manifest victory."

This Verse: 'Verily We have sent you (O Muḥammad) as a witness, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner.' (48.8) Which is in the Qur’án, appears in the Súrah thus: 'Verily We have sent you (O Muḥammad) as a witness, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner, and as a protector for the illiterates (i.e., the Arabs.) You are my slave and My Apostle, and I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (one who depends upon Alláh). You are neither hard-hearted nor of fierce character, nor one who shouts in the markets. You do not return evil for evil, but excuse and forgive. Alláh will not take you unto Him till He guides through you a crocked (curved) nation on the right path by causing them to say: "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh." With such a statement He will cause to open blind eyes, deaf ears and hardened hearts.'

I went to Abu Wail to ask him (about those who had rebelled against ‘Alí). On that Abu Wail said, "We were at Siffin (a city on the bank of the Euphrates, the place where me battle took place between ‘Alí and Muawiya) A man said, "Will you be on the side of those who are called to consult Alláh's Book (to settle the dispute)?" ‘Alí said, 'Yes (I agree that we should settle the matter in the light of the Qur’án)." ' Some people objected to ‘Alí's agreement and wanted to fight. On that Sahl bin Hunaif said, 'Blame yourselves! I remember how, on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (i.e. the peace treaty between the Prophet and the Quraish pagans), if we had been allowed to choose fighting, we would have fought (the pagans). At that time ‘Umar came (to the Prophet) and said, "Aren't we on the right (path) and they (pagans) in the wrong? Won't our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?" The Prophet replied, "Yes." ‘Umar further said, "Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Alláh has settled the matter between us?" The Prophet said, "O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Alláh's Apostle and Alláh will never neglect me." So ‘Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, "O Abu Bakr! Aren't we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?" Abu Bakr said, "O the son of Al-Khattab! He is Alláh's Apostle, and Alláh will never neglect him." Then Sura Al-Fath (The Victory) was revealed."

Narrated by Ibn Abi Mulaika {#6:368 .italic}

The two righteous persons were about to be ruined. They were Abu Bakr and ‘Umar who raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet when a mission from Bani Tamim came to him.

(Nafi', the sub-narrator said, I do not remember his name). Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar, "You wanted nothing but to oppose me!" ‘Umar said, "I did not intend to oppose you." Their voices grew loud in that argument, so Alláh revealed: 'O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet.' (49.2) Ibn Az-Zubair said, "Since the revelation of this Verse, ‘Umar used to speak in such a low tone that the Prophet had to ask him to repeat his statements." But Ibn Az-Zubair did not mention the same about his (maternal) grandfather (i.e. Abu Bakr).

The Prophet missed Thabit bin Qais for a period (So he inquired about him). A man said. "O Alláh's Apostle! I will bring you his news." So he went to Thabit and found him sitting in his house and bowing his head. The man said to Thabit, " 'What is the matter with you?" Thabit replied that it was an evil affair, for he used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds had been annulled, and he considered himself as one of the people of the Fire. Then the man returned to the Prophet and told him that Thabit had said, so-and-so. (Musa bin Anas) said: The man returned to Thabit with great glad tidings. The Prophet said to the man. "Go back to him and say to him: "You are not from the people of the Hell Fire, but from the people of Paradise."

On that Abu Bakr said (to ‘Umar). "You did not want but to oppose me!" ‘Umar replied "I did not intend to oppose you!" So both of them argued till their voices grew loud. So the following Verse was revealed: 'O you who believe! Be not for ward...' (49.1)

Paradise said, 'What is the matter with me? Why do only the weak and the humble among the people enter me?' On that, Alláh said to Paradise. 'You are My Mercy which I bestow on whoever I wish of my servants.' Then Alláh said to the (Hell) Fire, 'You are my (means of) punishment by which I punish whoever I wish of my slaves. And each of you will have its fill.' As for the Fire (Hell), it will not be filled till Alláh puts His Foot over it whereupon it will say, 'Qati! Qati!' At that time it will be filled, and its different parts will come closer to each other; and Alláh will not wrong any of His created beings. As regards Paradise, Alláh will create a new creation to fill it with."

Then Aisha recited the Verse: 'No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is the Most Courteous Well-Acquainted with all things.' (6.103) 'It is not fitting for a human being that Alláh should speak to him except by inspiration or from behind a veil.'

"Alláh curses those ladies who practice tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and those ladies who remove the hair from their faces and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful whereby they change Alláh's creation." His saying reached a lady from Bani Asd called Um Yaqub who came (to ‘Abdu’lláh) and said, "I have come to know that you have cursed such-and-such (ladies)?" He replied, "Why should I not curse these whom Alláh's Apostle has cursed and who are (cursed) in Alláh's Book!" Um Yaqub said, "I have read the whole Qur’án, but I did not find in it what you say." He said, "Verily, if you have read it (i.e. the Qur’án), you have found it. Didn't you read: 'And whatsoever the Apostle gives you take it and whatsoever he forbids you, you abstain (from it). (59.7) She replied, "Yes, I did," He said, "Verily, Alláh's Apostle forbade such things." "She said, "But I see your wife doing these things?" He said, "Go and watch her." She went and watched her but could not see anything in support of her statement. On that he said, "If my wife was as you thought, I would not keep her in my company."

I recommend that my successor should take care of and secure the rights of the early emigrants; and I also advise my successor to be kind to the Ansar who had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith, before the Prophet migrated to them, and to accept the good from their good ones and excuse their wrong doers.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:411 .italic}

A man came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I am suffering from fatigue and hunger." The Prophet sent (somebody) to his wives (to get something), but the messenger found nothing with them. Then Alláh's Apostle said (to his companions). "Isn't there anybody who can entertain this man tonight so that Alláh may be merciful to him?" An Ansari man got up and said, "I (will, entertain him), O Alláh's Apostle!" So he went to his wife and said to her, "This is the guest of Alláh's Apostle, so do not keep anything away from him." She said. "By Alláh, I have nothing but the children's food." He said, "When the children ask for their dinner, put them to bed and put out the light; we shall not take our meals tonight," She did so. In the morning the Ansari man went to Alláh's Apostle who said, "Alláh was pleased with (or He bestowed His Mercy) on so-and-so and his wife (because of their good deed)." Then Alláh revealed: 'But give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that.' (59.9)

Narrated by ‘Alí {#6:412 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent me along with AzZubair and Al-Miqdad and said, "Proceed till you reach a place called Raudat-Khakh where there is a lady travelling in a howda on a camel. She has a letter. Take the letter from her." So we set out, and our horses ran at full pace till we reached Raudat Khakh, and behold, we saw the lady and said (to her), "Take out the letter!" She said, "I have no letter with me." We said, "Either you take out the letter or we will strip you of your clothes." So she took the letter out of her hair braid. We brought the letter to the Prophet and behold, it was addressed by Hatib bin Abi Balta'a to some pagans at Mecca, informing them of some of the affairs of the Prophet. The Prophet said, "What is this, O Hatib?" Hatib replied, "Do not be hasty with me, O Alláh's Apostle! I am an Ansari man and do not belong to them (Quraish infidels) while the emigrants who were with you had their relatives who used to protect their families and properties at Mecca. So, to compensate for not having blood relation with them.' I intended to do them some favor so that they might protect my relatives (at Mecca), and I did not do this out of disbelief or an inclination to desert my religion." The Prophet then said (to his companions), "He (Hatib) has told you the truth." ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off?" The Apostle said, "He is one of those who witnessed (fought in) the Battle of Badr, and what do you know, perhaps Alláh looked upon the people of Badr (Badr warriors) and said, 'Do what you want as I have forgiven you.' " (Amr, a sub-narrator, said,: This Verse was revealed about him (Hatib): 'O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as friends or protectors.' (60.1)

Narrated by ‘Alí {#6:413 .italic}

Sufyan was asked whether (the Verse): 'Take not My enemies and your enemies...' was revealed in connection with Hatib. Sufyan replied, "This occurs only in the narration of the people. I memorized the Ḥadít_h from 'Amr, not overlooking even a single letter thereof, and I do not know of anybody who remembered it by heart other than myself."

Narrated by Urwa {#6:414 .italic}

Aisha the wife of the Prophet, said, "Alláh's Apostle used to examine the believing women who migrated to him in accordance with this Verse: 'O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance to you... Verily! Alláh is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.' (60.12) 'Aisha said, "And if any of the believing women accepted the condition (assigned in the above-mentioned Verse), Alláh's Apostle would say to her. "I have accepted your pledge of allegiance." "He would only say that, for, by Alláh, his hand never touched, any lady during that pledge of allegiance. He did not receive their pledge except by saying, "I have accepted your pledge of allegiance for that."

Narrated by Um Atiya {#6:415 .italic}

We took the oath of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle and he recited to us: 'They will not associate anything in worship with Alláh,' and forbade us to bewail the dead. Thereupon a lady withdrew her hand (refrained from taking the oath of allegiance), and said, "But such-and-such lady lamented over one of my relatives, so I must reward (do the same over the dead relatives of) hers." The Prophet did not object to that, so she went (there) and returned to the Prophet so he accepted her pledge of allegiance.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:416 .italic}

While we were with the Prophet, he said, "Will you swear to me the pledge of allegiance that you will not worship any thing besides Alláh, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, and will not steal?" Then he recited the Verse concerning the women. (Sufyan, the subnarrator, often said that the Prophet: added, "Whoever among you fulfills his pledge, will receive his reward from Alláh, and whoever commits any of those sins and receives the legal punishment (in this life), his punishment will be an expiation for that sin; and whoever commits any of those sins and Alláh screens him, then it is up to Alláh to punish or forgive them."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:418 .italic}

I witnessed the 'Id-al-Fitr prayer with Alláh's Apostle , Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and 'Uthman; and all of them offered it before delivering the sermon... and then delivered the sermon. Once the Prophet (after completing the prayer and the sermon) came down, as if I am now looking at him waving at the men with his hand to sit down, and walked through them till he, along with Bilal, reached (the rows of) the women. Then he recited: 'O Prophet! When believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance that they will not worship anything other than Alláh, will not steal, will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, will not kill their children, and will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (by making illegal children belonging to their husbands)'....(60.12) Having finished, he said, 'Do you agree to that?" One lady, other than whom none replied the Prophet said, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle!" (The, sub-narrator, Al-Ḥasan did not know who the lady was.) Then the Prophet said to them: "Will you give alms?" Thereupon Bilal spread out his garment and the women started throwing big rings and small rings into Bilal's garment. (See Ḥadít_h No. 95 vol.2)

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'I have several names: I am Muḥammad and I am Aḥmad, and I am Al-Mahi with whom Alláh obliterates Kufr (disbelief), and I am Al-Hashir (gatherer) at whose feet (i.e. behind whom) the people will be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), and I am Al-Aqib (i.e. who succeeds the other prophets in bringing about good)."

While we were sitting with the Prophet Surat Al-Jumu'a was revealed to him, and when the Verse, "And He (Alláh) has sent him (Muḥammad) also to other (Muslims).....' (62.3) was recited by the Prophet, I said, "Who are they, O Alláh's Apostle?" The Prophet did not reply till I repeated my question thrice. At that time, Salmán Al-Farisi was with us. So Alláh's Apostle put his hand on Salmán, saying, "If Faith were at (the place of) Ath-Thuraiya (pleiades, the highest star), even then (some men or man from these people (i.e. Salmán's folk) would attain it."

While I was taking part in a Ghazwa. I heard ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai (bin Abi Salul) saying. "Don't spend on those who are with Alláh's Apostle, that they may disperse and go away from him. If we return (to Medina), surely, the more honorable will expel the meaner amongst them." I reported that (saying) to my uncle or to ‘Umar who, in his turn, informed the Prophet of it. The Prophet called me and I narrated to him the whole story. Then Alláh's Apostle sent for ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai and his companions, and they took an oath that they did not say that. So Alláh's Apostle disbelieved my saying and believed his. I was distressed as I never was before. I stayed at home and my uncle said to me. "You just wanted Alláh's Apostle to disbelieve your statement and hate you." So Alláh revealed (the Sura beginning with) 'When the hypocrites come to you.' (63.1) The Prophet then sent for me and recited it and said, "O Zaid! Alláh confirmed your statement."

I was with my uncle and I heard ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul, saying, "Don't spend on those who are with Alláh's Apostle that they may disperse and go away from him." He also said, "If we return to Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel the meaner." So I informed my uncle of that and then my uncle informed Alláh's Apostle thereof. Alláh's Apostle sent for ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai and his companions. They swore that they did not say anything of that sort Alláh's Apostle deemed their statement true and rejected mine. Thereof I became as distressed as I have never been before, and stayed at home. Then Alláh revealed (Surat Al-Munafiqin): 'When the hypocrites come to you...(63.1) They are the ones who say: Spend nothing on those who are with Alláh's Apostle ..(63.7) Verily the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner..' (63.7-8) Alláh's Apostle sent for me and recited that Sura for me and said, "Alláh has confirmed your statement." 'That is because they believed, then disbelieved, so a seal was set on their hearts, therefore they understand not.' (63.3)

Narrated by Zaid bin Arqam {#6:425 .italic}

When ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai said, "Do not spend on those who are with Alláh's Apostle," and also said, "If we return to Medina," I informed the Prophet of his saying. The Ansar blamed me for that, and ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai swore that he did not say. I returned to my house and slept. Alláh's Apostle then called me and I went to him. He said, "Alláh has confirmed your statement." The Verse: "They are the one who say: Spend nothing...(63.7) was revealed.

Narrated by Zaid bin Arqam {#6:426 .italic}

We went out with the Prophet : on a journey and the people suffered from lack of provisions. So ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai said to his companions, "Don't spend on those who are with Alláh's Apostle, that they may disperse and go away from him." He also said, "If we return to Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner. So I went to the Prophet and informed him of that. He sent for ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai and asked him, but ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai swore that he did not say so. The people said, "Zaid told a lie to 'Alláh's Apostle." What they said distressed me very much. Later Alláh revealed the confirmation of my statement in his saying: '(When the hypocrites come to you.' (63.1) So the Prophet called them that they might ask Alláh to forgive them, but they turned their heads aside. (Concerning Alláh's saying: 'Pieces of wood propped up,' Zaid said; They were the most handsome men.)

The Prophet called me and I told him about that. Then he sent for ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai and his companions, and they swore that they did not say so. The Prophet disbelieved my statement and believed theirs. I was distressed as I have never been before, and I remained in my house. My uncle said to me, "You just wanted the Prophet to consider you a liar and hate you."

We were in a Ghazwa (Sufyan once said, in an army) and a man from the emigrants kicked an Ansari man (on the buttocks with his foot). The Ansari man said, "O the Ansar! (Help!)" and the emigrant said. "O the emigrants! (Help!) Alláh's Apostle heard that and said, "What is this call for, which is characteristic of the period of ignorance?" They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! A man from the emigrants kicked one of the Ansar (on the buttocks with his foot)." Alláh's Apostle said, "Leave it (that call) as is a detestable thing." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai heard that and said, 'Have the (the emigrants) done so? By Alláh, if we return Medina, surely, the more honorable will expel therefrom the meaner." When this statement reached the Prophet. ‘Umar got up an, said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite (‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai)!" The Prophet said "Leave him, lest the people say that Muḥammad kills his companions." The Ansar were then more in number than the emigrants when the latter came to Medina, but later on the emigrant increased.

‘Abdu’lláh bin Al-Faḍl told me that Anas bin Malik said, "I was much grieve over those who had been killed in the Battle of Al-Harra. When Zaid bin Arqarr heard of my intense grief (over the killed Ansar), he wrote a letter to me saying that he heard Alláh's Apostle saying, O Alláh! Forgive the Ansar and the Ansar children. The subnarrator, Ibn Al-Faḍl, is not sure whether the Prophet also said, And their grand-children." Some of those who were present, asked Anas (about Zaid). He said, "He (Zaid) is the one about whom Alláh's Apostle said, 'He is the one whose sound hearing Alláh testified.'

When Alláh's Apostle heard that, he said, "What is that?" They said, "A man from the emigrants kicked a man from the Ansar (on the buttocks his foot). On that the Ansar said, 'O the Ansar!' and the emigrant said, 'O the emigrants!" The Prophet said' "Leave it (that call) for it Is a detestable thing." The number of Ansar was larger (than that of the emigrants) at the time when the Prophet came to Medina, but later the number of emigrants increased. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai said, "Have they, (the emigrants) done so?

That ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar told him that he had divorced his wife while she was in her menses so ‘Umar informed Alláh's Apostle of that. Alláh's Apostle became very angry at that and said, "(Ibn ‘Umar must return her to his house and keep her as his wife till she becomes clean and then menstruates and becomes clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to divorce her, he may do so while she is still clean and before having any sexual relations with her, for that is the legally prescribed period for divorce as Alláh has ordered."

A man came to Ibn ‘Abbás while Abu Huraira was sitting with him and said, "Give me your verdict regarding a lady who delivered a baby forty days after the death of her husband." Ibn ‘Abbás said, "This indicates the end of one of the two prescribed periods." I said "For those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens." Abu Huraira said, I agree with my cousin (Abu Salama)." Then Ibn ‘Abbás sent his slave, Kuraib to Um Salama to ask her (regarding this matter). She replied. "The husband of Subai 'a al Aslamiya was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then her hand was asked in marriage and Alláh's Apostle married her (to somebody). Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who asked for her hand in marriage".

Alláh's Apostle used to drink honey in the house of Zainab, the daughter of Jahsh, and would stay there with her. So Hafsa and I agreed secretly that, if he come to either of us, she would say to him. "It seems you have eaten Maghafir (a kind of bad-smelling resin), for I smell in you the smell of Maghafir," (We did so) and he replied. "No, but I was drinking honey in the house of Zainab, the daughter of Jahsh, and I shall never take it again. I have taken an oath as to that, and you should not tell anybody about it."

For the whole year I had the desire to ask ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab regarding the explanation of a Verse (in Surat Al-Tahrim) but I could not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. ‘Umar went aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. "O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet who aided one another against him?" He said, "They were Hafsa and 'Aisha." Then I said to him, "By Alláh, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you." ‘Umar said, "Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you." Then ‘Umar added, "By Alláh, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Alláh revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, "I recommend that you do so-and-so." I said to her, "What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?" She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You don't want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Alláh's Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full day!" ‘Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, "O my daughter! Do you argue with Alláh's Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?" H. afsa said, "By Alláh, we argue with him." ‘Umar said, "Know that I warn you of Alláh's punishment and the anger of Alláh's Apostle . . . O my daughter! Don't be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Alláh's Apostle for her (i.e. 'Aisha)." ‘Umar addled, "Then I went out to Um Salama's house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Alláh's Apostle and his wives!' By Alláh, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, "Open Open!' I said, 'Has the king of Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but something worse; Alláh's Apostle has isolated himself from his wives.' I said, 'Let the nose of 'Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. humiliated)!' Then I put on my clothes and went to Alláh's Apostle's residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Alláh's Apostle was (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, 'Say (to the Prophet ) ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.' Then the Prophet admitted me and I narrated the story to Alláh's Apostle. When I reached the story of Um Salama, Alláh's Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said.' 'Why are you weeping?' I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Alláh's Apostle though you are, is living in destitute". The Prophet then replied. 'Won't you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?' "

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:437 .italic}

I intended to ask ‘Umar about those two ladies who back each other against 'Alláh's Apostle . For one year I was seeking the opportunity to ask this question, but in vain, until once when I accompanied him for Hajj. While we were in Zahran, ‘Umar went to answer the call of nature and told me to follow him with some water for ablution. So I followed him with a container of water and started pouring water for him. I found it a good opportunity to ask him, so I said, "O chief of the Believers! Who were those two ladies who had backed each other (against the Prophet)?" Before I could complete my question, he replied, "They were 'Aisha and Hafsa."

Narrated by ‘Umar {#6:438 .italic}

The wives of the Prophet out of their jealousy, backed each other against the Prophet, so I said to them, "It may be, if he divorced you all, that Alláh will give him, instead of you wives better than you." So this Verse was revealed. (66.5)

They are all those violent, arrogant and stubborn people."

I heard the Prophet saying, "Alláh will bring forth the severest Hour, and then all the Believers, men and women, will prostrate themselves before Him, but there will remain those who used to prostrate in the world for showing off and for gaining good reputation. Such people will try to prostrate (on the Day of Judgment) but their back swill be as stiff as if it is one bone (a single vertebra)."

All the idols which were worshipped by the people of Noah were worshipped by the Arabs later on. As for the idol Wadd, it was worshipped by the tribe of Kalb at Daumat-al-Jandal; Suwa' was the idol of (the tribe of) Murad and then by Ban, Ghutaif at Al-Jurf near Saba; Yauq was the idol of Hamdan, and Nasr was the idol of Himyr, the branch of Dhi-al-Kala.' The names (of the idols) formerly belonged to some pious men of the people of Noah, and when they died Satan inspired their people to (prepare and place idols at the places where they used to sit, and to call those idols by their names. The people did so, but the idols were not worshipped till those people (who initiated them) had died and the origin of the idols had become obscure, whereupon people began worshipping them.

Alláh's Apostle went out along with a group of his companions towards 'Ukaz Market. At that time something intervened between the devils and the news of the Heaven, and flames were sent down upon them, so the devils returned. Their fellow-devils said, "What is wrong with you? " They said, "Something has intervened between us and the news of the Heaven, and fires (flames) have been shot at us." Their fellow-devils said, "Nothing has intervened between you and the news of the Heaven, but an important event has happened. Therefore, travel all over the world, east and west, and try to find out what has happened." And so they set out and travelled all over the world, east and west, looking for that thing which intervened between them and the news of the Heaven. Those of the devils who had set out towards Tihama, went to Alláh's Apostle at Nakhla (a place between Mecca and Taif) while he was on his way to Ukaz Market. (They met him) while he was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Holy Qur’án being recited (by Alláh's Apostle), they listened to it and said (to each other). This is the thing which has intervened between you and the news of the Heavens." Then they returned to their people and said, "O our people! We have really heard a wonderful recital (Qur’án). It gives guidance to the right, and we have believed therein. We shall not join in worship, anybody with our Lord." (See 72.1-2) Then Alláh revealed to His Prophet (Surat al-Jinn): 'Say: It has been revealed to me that a group (3 to 9) of Jinns listened (to the Qur’án).' (72.1) The statement of the Jinns was revealed to him.

I said, "They say it was, 'Read, in the Name of your Lord Who created,' (i.e. Surat Al-'Alaq (the Clot)." On that, Abu Salama said, "I asked Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh about that, saying the same as you have said, whereupon he said, 'I will not tell you except what Alláh's Apostle had told us. Alláh's Apostle said, "I was in seclusion in the cave of Hiram', and after I completed the limited period of my seclusion. I came down (from the cave) and heard a voice calling me. I looked to my right, but saw nothing. Then I looked up and saw something. So I went to Khadija (the Prophet's wife) and told her to wrap me up and pour cold water on me. So they wrapped me up and poured cold water on me." Then, 'O you, (Muḥammad) wrapped up! Arise and warn,' (Surat Al Muddaththir) was revealed." (74.1)

I heard the Prophet describing the period of pause of the Divine Inspiration. He said in his talk, "While I was walking, I heard voices from the sky. I looked up, and behold ! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the cave of Hira' sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was too much afraid of him (so I returned to my house) and said, 'Fold me up in garments!' They wrapped me up. Then Alláh revealed: 'O you wrapped...and desert the idols before the prayer became compulsory.' Rujz means idols.

That he heard Alláh's Apostle describing the period of pause of the Divine Inspiration, and in his description he said, "While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up towards the sky, and behold! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the Cave of Hira', sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was so terrified by him that I fell down on the ground. Then I went to my wife and said, 'Wrap me in garments! Wrap me in garments!' They wrapped me, and then Alláh revealed: "O you, (Muḥammad) wrapped-up! Arise and warn...and desert the idols." (74.1-5) Abu Salama said...Rujz means idols." After that, the Divine Inspiration started coming more frequently and regularly.

The Prophet used to move his tongue when the divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. (Sufyan, a subnarrator, demonstrated (how the Prophet used to move his lips) and added. "In order to memorize it." So Alláh revealed: "Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith." (75.16)

Narrated by Musa bin Abi Aisha {#6:450 .italic}

That he asked Said bin Jubair regarding (the statement of Alláh). 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith.' He said, "Ibn ‘Abbás said that the Prophet used to move his lips when the Divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. So the Prophet was ordered not to move his tongue, which he used to do, lest some words should escape his memory. 'It is for Us to collect it' means, We will collect it in your chest;' and its recitation' means, We will make you recite it. 'But when We recite it (i.e. when it is revealed to you), follow its recital; it is for Us to explain it and make it clear,' (i.e. We will explain it through your tongue).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:451 .italic}

(as regards) Alláh's Statement: "Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith." (75.16) When Gabriel revealed the Divine Inspiration in Alláh's Apostle , he (Alláh's Apostle) moved his tongue and lips, and that state used to be very hard for him, and that movement indicated that revelation was taking place. So Alláh revealed in Surat Al-Qiyama which begins: 'I do swear by the Day of Resurrection...' (75) the Verses:-- 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it (Qur’án) in your mind, and give you the ability to recite it by heart. (75.16-17) Ibn ‘Abbás added: It is for Us to collect it (Qur’án) (in your mind), and give you the ability to recite it by heart means, "When We reveal it, listen. Then it is for Us to explain it," means, 'It is for us to explain it through your tongue.' So whenever Gabriel came to Alláh's Apostle ' he would keep quiet (and listen), and when the Angel left, the Prophet would recite that revelation as Alláh promised him.

Narrated by Aisha {#6:478 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Alláh's Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Alláh continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Alláh's Apostle replied, "I do not know how to read." The Prophet added, "Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, 'Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not." (96.1-5). Then Alláh's Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, "Cover me!" They covered him, and when the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, "O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me." Then he told her the story. Khadija said, "Nay! But receive the good tidings! By Alláh, Alláh will never disgrace you, for by Alláh, you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist those who are stricken with calamities." Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija's paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Alláh wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), "O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to say." Waraqa said, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" The Prophet then described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young." He added some other statement. Alláh's Apostle asked, "Will these people drive me out?" Waraqa said, "Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you strongly." But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Alláh's Apostle was very much grieved. Narrated Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh: While Alláh's Apostle was talking about the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. "Once while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in the cave of Hira.' He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap me!" So they covered him and then Alláh revealed: 'O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your garments purify and dessert the idols.' (74.1-5) Abu Salama said, "(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the Pre-lslamic period used to worship." After this the revelation started coming frequently and regularly.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:486 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, " Horses are kept for one of three purposes: A man may keep them (for Alláh's Cause) to receive a reward in the Hereafter; another may keep them as a means of protection; and a third may keep them to be a burden for him. As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, he is the one who ties it for Alláh's Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then, whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be written for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a source of) reward for such a man. If a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from asking others for help and he does not forget Alláh's right, i.e. pays its Zakat and gives it to be used in Alláh's Cause, then that horse will be a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be a burden (of sins) for him." Then Alláh's Apostle was asked regarding donkeys. He replied, "Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive Verse which includes everything: 'So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; and whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.'

His telling a lie against Me is his saying that I will not recreate him as I created him for the first time; and his abusing Me is his saying that Alláh has begotten children, while I am the self-sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, Who begets not nor was He begotten, and there is none like unto Me."

I asked Ubai bin Ka'b regarding the two Muwwidhat (Surats of taking refuge with Alláh). He said, "I asked the Prophet about them, He said, 'These two Surats have been recited to me and I have recited them (and are present in the Qur’án).' So, we say as Alláh's Apostle said (i.e., they are part of the Qur’án"

Narrated by Zirr bin Hubaish {#6:501 .italic}

I asked Ubai bin Ka'b, "O Abu AlMundhir! Your brother, Ibn Mas'ud said so-and-so (i.e., the two Mu'awwidh-at do not belong to the Qur’án)." Ubai said, "I asked Alláh's Apostle about them, and he said, 'They have been revealed to me, and I have recited them (as a part of the Qur’án)," So Ubai added, "So we say as Alláh's Apostle has said."

I was informed that Gabriel came to the Prophet while Um Salama was with him. Gabriel started talking (to the Prophet). Then the Prophet asked Um Salama, "Who is this?" She replied, "He is Dihya (al-Kalbi)." When Gabriel had left, Um Salama said, "By Alláh, I did not take him for anybody other than him (i.e. Dihya) till I heard the sermon of the Prophet wherein he informed about the news of Gabriel." The subnarrator asked Abu 'Uthman: From whom have you heard that? Abu 'Uthman said: From Usama bin Zaid.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#6:504 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Every Prophet was given miracles because of which people believed, but what I have been given, is Divine Inspiration which Alláh has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will outnumber the followers of the other Prophets on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#6:505 .italic}

Alláh sent down His Divine Inspiration to His Apostle continuously and abundantly during the period preceding his death till He took him unto Him. That was the period of the greatest part of revelation; and Alláh's Apostle died after that.

Narrated by Jundub {#6:506 .italic}

Once the Prophet fell ill and did not offer the night prayer (Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two. A woman (the wife of Abu Lahab) came to him and said, "O Muḥammad ! I do not see but that your Satan has left you." Then Alláh revealed (Surat-Ad-Duha): 'By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens (or is still); Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor hated you.' (93)

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#6:507 .italic}

(The Caliph 'Uthman ordered Zaid bin Thabit, Said bin Al-As, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham to write the Qur’án in the form of a book (Mushafs) and said to them. "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit (Al-Ansari) regarding any dialectic Arabic utterance of the Qur’án, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, for the Qur’án was revealed in this dialect." So they did it.

Narrated by Safwan bin Ya'la bin Umaiya {#6:508 .italic}

Ya'la used to say, "I wish I could see Alláh's Apostle at the time he is being inspired Divinely." When the Prophet was at Al-Ja'rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?" The Prophet waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. ‘Umar pointed out to Ya'la, telling him to come. Ya'la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet ) and behold! The Prophet's face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, "Where is the questioner who asked me about 'Umra a while ago?" The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to him), "As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your 'Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj."

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#6:509 .italic}

Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), "‘Umar has come to me and said: "Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the! Qur’án (i.e. those who knew the Qur’án by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur’án may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur’án be collected." I said to ‘Umar, "How can you do something which Alláh's Apostle did not do?" ‘Umar said, "By Alláh, that is a good project. "‘Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Alláh opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which ‘Umar had realized." Then Abu Bakr said (to me). 'You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Alláh's Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur’án and collect it in one book)." By Alláh If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur’án. Then I said to Abu Bakr, "How will you do something which Alláh's Apostle did not do?" Abu Bakr replied, "By Alláh, it is a good project." Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Alláh opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. So I started looking for the Qur’án and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is: 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muḥammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa' (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur’án remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with ‘Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of ‘Umar.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#6:510 .italic}

Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of ‘Iráq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and ‘Iráq) differences in the recitation of the Qur’án, so he said to 'Uthman, "O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Qur’án) as Jews and the Christians did before." So 'Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, "Send us the manuscripts of the Qur’án so that we may compile the Qur’ánic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you." Hafsa sent it to 'Uthman. 'Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, ‘Abdu’lláh bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and 'AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. 'Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, "In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur’án, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur’án was revealed in their tongue." They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. 'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur’ánic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Said bin Thabit added, "A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur’án and I used to hear Alláh's Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. (That Verse was): 'Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Alláh.' (33.23)

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#6:511 .italic}

Abu Bakr sent for me and said, "You used to write the Divine Revelations for Alláh's Apostle : So you should search for (the Qur’án and collect) it." I started searching for the Qur’án till I found the last two Verses of Surat At-Tauba with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari and I could not find these Verses with anybody other than him. (They were): 'Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muḥammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty ...' (9.128-129)

Narrated by Al-Bara {#6:512 .italic}

There was revealed: 'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Alláh.' (4.95) The Prophet said, "Call Zaid for me and let him bring the board, the inkpot and the scapula bone (or the scapula bone and the ink pot)."' Then he said, "Write: 'Not equal are those Believers who sit..", and at that time 'Amr bin Um Maktum, the blind man was sitting behind the Prophet . He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is your order For me (as regards the above Verse) as I am a blind man?" So, instead of the above Verse, the following Verse was revealed: 'Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the cause of Alláh.' (4.95)

Narrated by ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab {#6:514 .italic}

I heard Hisham bin Ḥakím reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Alláh's Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, "Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?" He replied, "Alláh's Apostle taught it to me." I said, "You have told a lie, for Alláh's Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours." So I dragged him to Alláh's Apostle and said (to Alláh's Apostle): "I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven't taught me!" On that Alláh's Apostle said, "Release him, (O ‘Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!" Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Alláh's Apostle said, "It was revealed in this way," and added, "Recite, O ‘Umar!" I recited it as he had taught me. Alláh's Apostle then said, "It was revealed in this way. This Qur’án has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you)."

While I was with Aisha, the mother of the Believers, a person from ‘Iráq came and asked, "What type of shroud is the best?" 'Aisha said, "May Alláh be merciful to you! What does it matter?" He said, "O mother of the Believers! Show me (the copy of) your Qur’án," She said, "Why?" He said, "In order to compile and arrange the Qur’án according to it, for people recite it with its Suras not in proper order." 'Aisha said, "What does it matter which part of it you read first? (Be informed) that the first thing that was revealed thereof was a Sura from Al-Mufassal, and in it was mentioned Paradise and the Fire. When the people embraced Islam, the Verses regarding legal and illegal things were revealed. If the first thing to be revealed was: 'Do not drink alcoholic drinks.' people would have said, 'We will never leave alcoholic drinks,' and if there had been revealed, 'Do not commit illegal sexual intercourse, 'they would have said, 'We will never give up illegal sexual intercourse.' While I was a young girl of playing age, the following Verse was revealed in Mecca to Muḥammad: 'Nay! But the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.' (54.46) Sura Al-Baqara (The Cow) and Surat An-Nisa (The Women) were revealed while I was with him." Then 'Aisha took out the copy of the Qur’án for the man and dictated to him the Verses of the Suras (in their proper order).

But he treated the chief by reciting something, and the sick man recovered whereupon he gave him thirty sheep and gave us milk to drink (as a reward).

He said, "No, but I treated him only with the recitation of the Mother of the Book (i.e., Al-Fatiha)." We said, "Do not say anything (about it) till we reach or ask the Prophet so when we reached Medina, we mentioned that to the Prophet (in order to know whether the sheep which we had taken were lawful to take or not). The Prophet said, "How did he come to know that it (Al-Fatiha) could be used for treatment? Distribute your reward and assign for me one share thereof as well."

The Prophet said, "Give her anything, even if it were an iron ring." The man apologized again. The Prophet then asked him, "What do you know by heart of the Qur’án?" He replied, "I know such-and-such portion of the Qur’án (by heart)." The Prophet said, "Then I marry her to you for that much of the Qur’án which you know by heart."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sad {#6:548 .italic}

A lady came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have come to you to offer myself to you." He raised his eyes and looked at her and then lowered his head. When the lady saw that he did not make any decision, she sat down. On that, a man from his companions got up and said. "O Alláh's Apostle! If you are not in need of this woman, then marry her to me." Alláh's Apostle said, "Do you have anything to offer her?" He replied. "No, by Alláh, O Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet said to him, "Go to your family and see if you can find something.' The man went and returned, saying, "No, by Alláh, O Alláh's Apostle! I have not found anything." The Prophet said, "Try to find something, even if it is an iron ring.'' He went again and returned, saying, "No, by Alláh, O Alláh's Apostle, not even an iron ring, but I have this waist sheet of mine." The man had no upper garment, so he intended to give her, half his waist sheet. So Alláh's Apostle said, ''What would she do with your waist sheet? If you wear it, she will have nothing of it over her body, and if she wears it, you will have nothing over your body." So that man sat for a long period and then got up, and Alláh's Apostle saw him going away, so he ordered somebody to call him. When he came, the Prophet asked him, " How much of the Qur’án do you know?" He replied, "I know such Surat and such Surat and such Surat," and went on counting it, The Prophet asked him, "Can you recite it by heart?" he replied, "Yes." The Prophet said, "Go, I have married this lady to you for the amount of the Qur’án you know by heart."

The Prophet said, "It is a bad thing that some of you say, 'I have forgotten such-and-such verse of the Qur’án,' for indeed, he has been caused (by Alláh) to forget it. So you must keep on reciting the Qur’án because it escapes from the hearts of men faster than camel do."

He replied, "Alláh's Apostle taught it to me." I said, "You are telling a lie; By Alláh! Alláh's Apostle taught me (in a different way) this very Súrah which I have heard you reciting." So I took him, leading him to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I heard this person reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way that you did not teach me, and you have taught me Surat-al-Furqan." The Prophet said, "O Hisham, recite!" So he recited in the same way as I heard him recite it before. On that Alláh's Apostle said, "It was revealed to be recited in this way." Then Alláh's Apostle said, "Recite, O ‘Umar!" So I recited it as he had taught me. Alláh's Apostle then said, "It was revealed to be recited in this way."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#6:564 .italic}

Regarding His (Alláh's) Statement: 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith.' (75.16) And whenever Gabriel descended to Alláh's Apostle with the Divine Inspiration, Alláh's Apostle used to move his tongue and lips, and that used to be hard for him, and one could easily recognize that he was being inspired Divinely. So Alláh revealed the Verse which occurs in the Súrah starting with "I do swear by the Day of Resurrection.' (75.1) i.e. 'Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste then with. It is for Us to collect it (in your mind) (O Muḥammad) an give you the ability to recite it 'by heart.' (75.16-17) which means: It is for us to collect it (in your mind) and give you the ability to recite it by heart. And when We have recited it to you (O Muḥammad) through Gabriel then follow you its recital. (75.18) means: 'When We reveal it (the Qur’án) to you, Listen to it.' for then: It is for Us to explain it and make it clear to you' (75.19) i.e. It is up to Us to explain it through your tongue. So, when Gabriel came to him, Alláh's Apostle would listen to him attentively, and as soon as Gabriel left, he would recite the Revelations, as Alláh had promised him.

My father got me married to a lady of a noble family, and often used to ask my wife about me, and she used to reply, "What a wonderful man he is! He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me." When this state continued for a long period, my father told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, "Let me meet him." Then I met him and he asked me, "How do you fast?" I replied, "I fast daily," He asked, "How long does it take you to finish the recitation of the whole Qur’án?" I replied, "I finish it every night." On that he said, "Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur’án (and finish it) in one month." I said, "But I have power to do more than that." He said, "Then fast for three days per week." I said, "i have the power to do more than that." He said, "Therefore, fast the most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur’án In seven days." I wish I had accepted the permission of Alláh's Apostle as I have become a weak old man. It is said that ‘Abdu’lláh used to recite one-seventh of the Qur’án during the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet.

Then one of them said, "I will offer the prayer throughout the night forever." The other said, "I will fast throughout the year and will not break my fast." The third said, "I will keep away from the women and will not marry forever." Alláh's Apostle came to them and said, "Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Alláh, I am more submissive to Alláh and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one of my followers)."

That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, "O my nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve.

And if they had no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them, when they had no interest, in them, they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest, unless they treated them justly and gave them their full Mahr Apostle said, 'If at all there is evil omen, it is in the horse, the woman and the house." a lady is to be warded off.

Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, 'Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?' I said, 'Yes.' Abu Bakr said, 'Nothing stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Alláh's Apostle had mentioned her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Alláh's Apostle.

Even if I have not married Um Salama, she would not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster brother." 'And there is no blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts. Alláh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.' (2.235) Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Hint your intention of marrying' is made by saying (to the widow) for example: "I want to marry, and I wish that Alláh will make a righteous lady available for me.' " Al-Qasim said: One may say to the widow: 'I hold all respect for you, and I am interested in you; Alláh will bring you much good, or something similar 'Ata said: One should hint his intention, and should not declare it openly. One may say: 'I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to Alláh; you are fit to remarry.' She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what you say,' but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid).

I have not found anything." The Prophet said, "Go again and look for something, even if it were an iron ring." He went and returned, saying, "No, by Alláh, O Alláh's Apostle! I could not find even an iron ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).' He had no Riḍá (upper garment). He added, "I give half of it to her." Alláh's Apostle said "What will she do with your Izar?

Then the Prophet said, "Do you know something of the Qur’án (by heart)?" He replied, "I know (by heart) such Sura and such Sura." The Prophet said, "Go! I have married her to you for what you know of the Qur’án (by heart)."

So she prepared Haisa (a sweet dish) made from dates, butter and dried yoghurt and she sent it with me to him. I took it to him and he said, "Put it down," and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and to invite whomever I would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and when I returned, I found the house crowded with people and saw the Prophet keeping his hand over the Haisa and saying over it whatever Alláh wished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches of ten to eat of it, and he said to them, "Mention the Name of Alláh, and each man should eat of the dish the nearest to him." When all of them had finished their meals, some of them left and a few remained there talking, over which I felt unhappy. Then the Prophet went out towards the dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after him and told him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered his dwelling place and let the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwelling place, and he was reciting the Verses:-- 'O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet's house until leave is given you for a meal, (and then) not (as early as) to what for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, disperse without sitting for a talk. Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go), but Alláh is not shy of (telling you) the Truth.'

When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the threshold of 'Aisha's dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then, he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with him. When we reached the threshold of 'Aisha's dwelling place, he thought that they had left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people had left. Then the Prophet drew a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were revealed.

The third one said, "My husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of that) he will divorce me, and if I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife." The fourth one said, "My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot nor cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him." The fifth one said, "My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a lion. He does not ask about whatever is in the house."

The eighth one said, "My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of good smelling grass)."

The tenth one said, "My husband is Malik, and what is Malik? Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going to be slaughtered for the guests." The eleventh one said, "My husband is Abu Zar and what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain . Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the son of Abu Zar? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of her husband's other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the (maid) slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our house." The eleventh lady added, "One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, 'Eat (of this), O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives." She added, "Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the smallest utensil of Abu Zar's." 'Aisha then said: Alláh's Apostle said to me, "I am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#7:119 .italic}

I had been eager to ask ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Alláh said 'If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Alláh, your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4) till ‘Umar performed the Hajj and I too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) ‘Umar went aside to answer the call of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when ‘Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he performed the ablution. Then I said to him, "O chief of the Believers! Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Alláh said: 'If you two (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Alláh your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes)?" (66.4) He said, "I am astonished at your question, O Ibn ‘Abbás. They were 'Aisha and Hafsa." Then ‘Umar went on narrating the Ḥadít_h and said, "I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, 'Why are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Alláh, the wives of the Prophet answer him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the night.' The (talk) scared me and I said to her, 'Whoever has done so will be ruined!' Then I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, 'Does anyone of you keep the Prophet angry till night?' She said, 'Yes.' I said, 'You are a ruined losing person! Don't you fear that Alláh may get angry for the anger of Alláh's Apostle and thus you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e., 'Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet ." ‘Umar added,"At that time a talk was circulating among us that (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said, 'Today a great thing has happened.' I asked, 'What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan come?' He said, 'No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that: Alláh's Apostle; has divorced his wives. ‘Umar added, "The Prophet kept away from his wives and I said "Hafsa is a ruined loser.' I had already thought that most probably this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, 'What makes you weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?' She said, 'I do not know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.' I came out and sat near the pulpit and saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet; was and said to a black slave of his, 'Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for ‘Umar (to enter)?' The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned saying, 'I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.' Then I returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear the situation and once again I said to the slave, 'Will you get the permission for ‘Umar?' He went in and returned saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' So I returned again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, and so I went to the slave and said, 'Will you get the permission for ‘Umar?' He went in and returned to me saying, 'I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.' When I was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, 'The Prophet has given you permission.' Then I entered upon Alláh's Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?' He looked at me and said, 'No.' I said, 'Alláh Akbar!' And then, while still standing, I said chatting, 'Will you heed what I say, O Alláh's Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were overpowered by their women.' The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, 'Will you heed what I say, O Alláh's Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, "Do not be tempted to imitate your companion ('Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' " The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Alláh, I could not see anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not worship Alláh.' Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, 'Are you of such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the rewards for their good deeds in this world.' I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Ask Alláh to forgive me.' Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the story which Hafsa had disclosed to 'Aisha. The Prophet had said, 'I will not enter upon them (my wives) for one month,' because of his anger towards them, when Alláh had admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon 'Aisha. 'Aisha said to him, 'O Alláh's Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting them one by one.' The Prophet said, 'The (present) month is of twenty nine days.' 'Aisha added, 'Then Alláh revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he asked me first, and I chose him.' Then he gave option to his other wives and they said what 'Aisha had said . " (1) The Prophet, ' had decided to abstain from eating a certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Alláh blamed him for doing so. Some of his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one month. See Qur’án: (66.4)

During the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle, the sun eclipsed. Alláh's Apostle offered the prayer of (the) eclipse) and so did the people along with him. He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during which Surat-al-Baqara could have been recited; then he performed a pro-longed bowing, then raised his head and stood for a long time which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited Qur’án). Then he performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was shorter than the period of the first bowing, then he stood up and then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the period of standing was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of a lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a long time but for a lesser duration than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than the first, and then he again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer. By then the sun eclipse had cleared. The Prophet then said, "The sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Alláh, and they do not eclipse because of the death or birth of someone, so when you observe the eclipse, remember Alláh (offer the eclipse prayer)." They (the people) said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We saw you stretching your hand to take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping backward." He said, "I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched my hand to pluck a bunch (of grapes), and had I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as long as this world exists. Then I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible sight as that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women." The people asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is the reason for that?" He replied, "Because of their ungratefulness." It was said. "Do they disbelieve in Alláh (are they ungrateful to Alláh)?" He replied, "They are not thankful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them. Even if you do good to one of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from you, she will say, "I have never seen any good from you.' "

Then the gatekeeper called him and he entered upon the Prophet, and asked, "Have you divorced your wives?" The Prophet, said, "No, but I have taken an oath not to go to them for one month."

Regarding the Verse: 'If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part ...')

This is indicated by the Statement of Alláh: 'There is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between them both, and (such) settlement is better." (4.128)

When night fell the Prophet would ride beside 'Aisha and talk with her. One night Hafsa said to 'Aisha, "Won't you ride my camel tonight and I ride yours, so that you may see (me) and I see (you) (in new situation)?" 'Aisha said, "Yes, (I agree.)" So 'Aisha rode, and then the Prophet came towards 'Aisha's camel on which Hafsa was riding. He greeted Hafsa and then proceeded (beside her) till they dismounted (on the way). 'Aisha missed him, and so, when they dismounted, she put her legs in the Idhkhir and said, "O Lord (Alláh)! Send a scorpion or a snake to bite me for I am not to blame him (the Prophet ).

When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any slave or anything else except a camel which drew water from the well, and his horse. I used to feed his horse with fodder and drew water and sew the bucket for drawing it, and prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake bread. So our Ansari neighbors used to bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to carry the date stones on my head from Zubair's land given to him by Alláh's Apostle and this land was two third Farsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date stones on my head, I met Alláh's Apostle along with some Ansari people. He called me and then, (directing his camel to kneel down) said, "Ikh! Ikh!" so as to make me ride behind him (on his camel). I felt shy to travel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and his sense of Ghira, as he was one of those people who had the greatest sense of Ghira. Alláh's Apostle noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded. I came to Az-Zubair and said, "I met Alláh's Apostle while I was carrying a load of date stones on my head, and he had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I might ride, but I felt shy in his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On that Az-Zubair said, "By Alláh, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the Prophet in such a state) is more shameful to me than your riding with him." (I continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse, whereupon I felt as if he had set me free.

" Thereupon I said, "Yes (you are right), but by Alláh, O Alláh's Apostle, I leave nothing but your name."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#7:156 .italic}

I never felt so jealous of any wife of Alláh's Apostle as I did of Khadija because Alláh's Apostle used to remember and praise her too often and because it was revealed to Alláh's Apostle that he should give her (Khadija) the glad tidings of her having a palace of Qasab in Paradise.

The Prophet was screening me with his Riḍá' (garment covering the upper part of the body) while I was looking at the Ethiopians who were playing in the courtyard of the mosque.

He said, "Why didn't you marry a young girl with whom you could play and who could play with you?" Then when we approached (Medina) and were going to enter (it), the Prophet said, "Wait till you enter (your homes) at night (in the first part of the night) so that the ladies with unkempt hair may comb their hair, and those whose husbands have been absent (for a long time) may shave their pubic hair."

So they asked Sahl bin Sad As-Sa‘íd who was the only surviving Companion (of the Prophet) at Medina. He replied, "Nobody Is left at Medina who knows it better than I. Fatima was washing the blood off his face and ‘Alí was bringing water in his shield, and then a mat of date-palm leaves was burnt and (the ash) was inserted into the wound."

Then the Prophet returned with Bilal to his house . "

We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, "Sit here," and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu'man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, "Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift." She said, "Can a princess give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?" The Prophet raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, "I seek refuge with Alláh from you." He said, "You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, "O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family."

Tell me, if a man sees his wife with another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him in Qisas, or what should he do? O 'Asim! Please ask Alláh's Apostle about that." 'Asim asked Alláh's Apostle about that. Alláh's Apostle disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What 'Asim heard from Alláh's Apostle was hard on him. When he returned to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said "O 'Asim! What did Alláh's Apostle say to you?" 'Asim said, "You never bring me any good. Alláh's Apostle disliked to hear the problem which I asked him about." 'Uwaimir said, "By Alláh, I will not leave the matter till I ask him about it." So 'Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Alláh's Apostle who was in the midst of the people and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If a man finds with his wife another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him (in Qisas): or otherwise, what should he do?" Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh has revealed something concerning the question of you and your wife. Go and bring her here." So they both carried out the judgment of Lian, while I was present among the people (as a witness). When both of them had finished, 'Uwaimir said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If I should now keep my wife with me, then I have told a lie". Then he pronounced his decision to divorce her thrice before Alláh's Apostle ordered him to do so.

So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet came to anyone of us, she should say him, "I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?' " So the Prophet visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet said, "Never mind, I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore." So there was revealed: 'O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Alláh has made lawful for you... If you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Alláh,' (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. 'When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.' (66.3) namely his saying: But I have taken some honey."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#7:193 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing the 'Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went to Hafsa, the daughter of ‘Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I said, "By Alláh we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so)." So I said to Sada bint Zam'a "The Prophet will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: 'Have you taken Maghafir (a bad-smelling gum)?' He will say, 'No.' Then say to him: 'Then what is this bad smell which i smell from you?' He will say to you, 'Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.' Then say: Perhaps the bees of that honey had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-'Urfut.' I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say the same." Later Sada said, "By Alláh, as soon as he (the Prophet ) stood at the door, I was about to say to him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you." So when the Prophet came near Sada, she said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle! Have you taken Maghafir?" He said, "No." She said. "Then what is this bad smell which I detect on you?" He said, "Hafsa made me drink honey syrup." She said, "Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-'Urfut tree." When he came to me, I also said the same, and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet again went to Hafsa, she said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Shall I give you more of that drink?" He said, "I am not in need of it." Sada said, "By Alláh, we deprived him (of it)." I said to her, "Keep quiet." '

A man from the tribe of Bani Aslam came to the Prophet while he was in the mosque and said, "I have committed illegal sexual intercourse." The Prophet turned his face to the other side. The man turned towards the side towards which the Prophet had turned his face, and gave four witnesses against himself. On that the Prophet called him and said, "Are you insane?" (He added), "Are you married?" The man said, 'Yes." On that the Prophet ordered him to be stoned to the death in the Musalla (a praying place). When the stones hit him with their sharp edges and he fled, but he was caught at Al-Harra and then killed.

On that the Prophet turned his face from him to the other side, whereupon the man moved to the side towards which the Prophet had turned his face, and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have committed illegal sexual intercourse." The Prophet turned his face (from him) to the other side whereupon the man moved to the side towards which the Prophet had turned his face, and repeated his statement. The Prophet turned his face (from him) to the other side again. The man moved again (and repeated his statement) for the fourth time. So when the man had given witness four times against himself, the Prophet called him and said, "Are you insane?" He replied, "No." The Prophet then said (to his companions), "Go and stone him to death." The man was a married one. Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh Al-Ansari said: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the Musalla ('Id praying place) in Medina. When the stones hit him with their sharp edges, he fled, but we caught him at Al-Harra and stoned him till he died.

On that Alláh's Apostle said (to her), "Will you give back the garden which your husband has given you (as Mahr)?" She said, "Yes." Then the Prophet said to Thabit, "O Thabit! Accept your garden, and divorce her once."

On that, Alláh's Apostle said (to her), 'Will you return his garden to him?" She said, "Yes." So she returned his garden to him and the Prophet told him to divorce her.

(the wife of the Prophet) Three traditions were established concerning situations in which Barra was involved: When she was manumitted, she was given the option to keep her husband or leave him; Alláh's Apostle said, "The wala is for the one who manumits, Once Alláh's Apostle entered the house while some meat was being cooked in a pot, but only bread and some soup of the house were placed before, him. He said, "Don't I see the pot containing meat?" They said, "Yes, but that meat was given to Barira in charity (by someone), and you do not eat what it given in charity."The Prophet said "That meat is alms for her, but for us it is a present."

She said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do you order me to do so?" He said, "No, I only intercede for him." She said, "I am not in need of him."

Whenever Ibn ‘Umar was asked about marrying a Christian lady or a Jewess, he would say: "Alláh has made it unlawful for the believers to marry ladies who ascribe partners in worship to Alláh, and I do not know of a greater thing, as regards to ascribing partners in worship, etc. to Alláh, than that a lady should say that Jesus is her Lord although he is just one of Alláh's slaves."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#7:210 .italic}

The pagans were of two kinds as regards their relationship to the Prophet and the Believers. Some of them were those with whom the Prophet was at war and used to fight against, and they used to fight him; the others were those with whom the Prophet made a treaty, and neither did the Prophet fight them, nor did they fight him. If a lady from the first group of pagans emigrated towards the Muslims, her hand would not be asked in marriage unless she got the menses and then became clean. When she became clean, it would be lawful for her to get married, and if her husband emigrated too before she got married, then she would be returned to him. If any slave or female slave emigrated from them to the Muslims, then they would be considered free persons (not slaves) and they would have the same rights as given to other emigrants. The narrator then mentioned about the pagans involved with the Muslims in a treaty, the same as occurs in Mujahid's narration. If a male slave or a female slave emigrated from such pagans as had made a treaty with the Muslims, they would not be returned, but their prices would be paid (to the pagans). Narrated Ibn ‘Abbás: Qariba, the daughter of Abi Umaiyya, was the wife of ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab. ‘Umar divorced her and then Mu'awiyya bin Abi Sufyan married her. Similarly, Um Al-Hakam, the daughter of Abi Sufyan was the wife of 'Iyad bin Ghanm Al-Fihri. He divorced her and then ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Uthman Al-Thaqafi married her.

When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them . . .' (60.10) So if anyone of those believing women accepted the above mentioned conditions, she accepted the conditions of faith. When they agreed on those conditions and confessed that with their tongues, Alláh's Apostle would say to them, "Go, I have accepted your oath of allegiance (for Islam). By Alláh, and hand of Alláh's Apostle never touched the hand of any woman, but he only used to take their pledge of allegiance orally. By Alláh, Alláh's Apostle did not take the pledge of allegiance of the women except in accordance with what Alláh had ordered him. When he accepted their pledge of allegiance he would say to them, "I have accepted your oath of allegiance."

And then the Prophet was asked about a Luqata (money found by somebody). He said, "Remember and recognize its tying material and its container, and make public announcement about it for one year.

Please, O 'Asim, ask about this on my behalf." 'Asim asked Alláh's Apostle about it. Alláh's Apostle, disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What 'Asim heard from Alláh's Apostle was hard on him. When 'Asim returned to his family, 'Uwaimir came to him and said, "O 'Asim! What did Alláh's Apostle. say to you?" 'Asim said to 'Uwaimir, "You never bring me any good. Alláh's Apostle disliked the problem which I asked him about." 'Uwaimir said, "By Alláh, I will not give up this matter until I ask the Prophet about it." So 'Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Alláh's Apostle in the midst of people, and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If a man sees another man with his wife, would he kill him, whereupon you would kill him, or what should he do?" Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh has revealed some decree as regards you and your wives case. Go and bring her."

If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?' So Alláh revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Qur’án about the affair of those involved in a case of Lian. The Prophet said, 'Alláh has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.' So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then he divorced her thrice before Alláh's Apostle ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet ." Ibn Shihab added, "After their case, it became a tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, and later on her son was called by his mother's name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Alláh had prescribed for him." Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sad As'Saidi said that the Prophet said (in the above narration), "If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth." Then she delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty).

'Asim took the man to the Prophet and the man told him of the state in which he had found his wife. The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet invoked, saying, 'O Alláh! Reveal the truth.' So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he had found her with. The Prophet then made them carry out Lian." Then a man from that gathering asked Ibn ‘Abbás, "Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet had said, 'If I were to stone to death someone without witness, I would have stoned this lady'?" Ibn ‘Abbás said, "No, that was another lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior. "

'Ursa said (to 'Aisha), "Haven't you heard the statement of Fatima?" 'Aisha replied, "It is not in her favor to mention."

Ma'qil gave his sister in marriage and later her husband divorced her once.

Narrated by Al-Ḥasan {#7:248 .italic}

The sister of Ma'qil bin Yasar was married to a man and then that man divorced her and remained away from her till her period of the 'Iddah expired. Then he demanded for her hand in marriage, but Ma'qil got angry out of pride and haughtiness and said, "He kept away from her when he could still retain her, and now he demands her hand again?" So Ma'qil disagreed to remarry her to him. Then Alláh revealed: 'When you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.' (2.232) So the Prophet sent for Ma'qil and recited to him (Alláh's order) and consequently Ma'qil gave up his pride and haughtiness and yielded to Alláh's order.

Narrated by Nafi {#7:249 .italic}

Ibn ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab divorced his wife during her menses. Alláh's Apostle ordered him to take her back till she became clean, and when she got another period while she was with him, she should wait till she became clean again and only then, if he wanted to divorce her, he could do so before having sexual relations with her. And that is the period Alláh has fixed for divorcing women. Whenever ‘Abdu’lláh (bin ‘Umar) was asked about that, he would say to the questioner, "If you divorced her thrice, she is no longer lawful for you unless she marries another man (and the other man divorces her in his turn).' Ibn ‘Umar further said, 'Would that you (people) only give one or two divorces, because the Prophet has ordered me so."

Narrated by Yunus Ibn Jubair {#7:250 .italic}

I asked Ibn ‘Umar, "Will that divorce (during the menses) be counted?" He replied, "If somebody behaves foolishly (will his foolishness be an excuse for his misbehavior)?"

Narrated by Humaid bin Nafi' {#7:251 .italic}

Zainab bint Abu Salama told me these three narrations: Zainab said: I went to Um Habiba, the wife of the Prophet when her father, Abú- Sufyan bin Herb had died. Um ,Habiba asked for a perfume which contained yellow scent (Khaluq) or some other scent, and she first perfumed one of the girls with it and then rubbed her cheeks with it and said, "By Alláh, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Alláh and the Last Day to mourn for a dead person for more than three days unless he is her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.' " Zainab further said: I want to Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother died. She asked for perfume and used some of it and said, "By Alláh, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Alláh's Apostle saying on the pulpit, 'It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Alláh and the last day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.' " Zainab further said, "I heard my mother, Um Salama saying that a woman came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease, can she apply kohl to her eye?" Alláh's Apostle replied, "No," twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, "No." Then Alláh's Apostle added, "It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed." I said to Zainab, "What does 'throwing a globe of dung when one year had elapsed' mean?" Zainab said, "When a lady was bereaved of her husband, she would live in a wretched small room and put on the worst clothes she had and would not touch any scent till one year had elapsed. Then she would bring an animal, e.g. a donkey, a sheep or a bird and rub her body against it. The animal against which she would rub her body would scarcely survive. Only then she would come out of her room, whereupon she would be given a globe of dung which she would throw away and then she would use the scent she liked or the like."

Narrated by Um Salama {#7:252 .italic}

A woman was bereaved of her husband and her relatives worried about her eyes (which were diseased). They came to Alláh's Apostle, and asked him to allow them to treat her eyes with kohl, but he said, "She should not apply kohl to her eyes. (In the Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance) a widowed woman among you would stay in the worst of her clothes (or the worst part of her house) and when a year had elapsed, if a dog passed by her, she would throw a globe of dung, Nay, (she cannot use kohl) till four months and ten days have elapsed." Narrated Um Habiba: The Prophet said, "It is not lawful for a Muslim woman who believes in Alláh and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days, except for her husband, for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days."

But it was permissible for us that when one of us became clean from her menses and took a bath, she could use a piece of a certain kind of incense. And it was forbidden for us to follow funeral processions.

Narrated by Um 'Atiyya {#7:255 .italic}

The Prophet said, "It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Alláh and the Last Day, to mourn for more than three days for a dead person, except for her husband, in which case she should neither put kohl in her eyes, nor perfume herself, nor wear dyed clothes, except a garment of 'Asb" Um 'Atiyya added: The Prophet said, "She should not use perfume except when she becomes clean from her menses whereupon she can use Qust, and Azfar (two kinds of incense).

Narrated by Mujahid {#7:256 .italic}

(regarding the Verse): 'If any of you dies and leaves wives behind,' That was the period of the 'Iddah which the widow was obliged to spend in the house of the late husband. Then Alláh revealed: And those of you who die and leave wives should bequeath for their wives a year's maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they leave, there is no blame on you for what they do of themselves, provided it is honorable (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240) Mujahid said: Alláh has ordered that a widow has the right to stay for seven months and twenty days with her husband's relatives through her husband's will and testament so that she will complete the period of one year (of 'Iddah). But the widow has the right to stay that extra period or go out of her husband's house as is indicated by the statement of Alláh: 'But if they leave there is no blame on you,... ' (2.240) Ibn ‘Abbás said: The above Verse has cancelled the order of spending the period of the 'Iddah at her late husband's house, and so she could spend her period of the 'Iddah wherever she likes. And Alláh says: 'Without turning them out.' 'Ata said: If she would, she could spend her period of the 'Iddah at her husband's house, and live there according to her (husband's) will and testament, and if she would, she could go out (of her husband's house) as Alláh says: 'There is no blame on you for what they do of themselves.' (2.240) 'Ata added: Then the Verses of inheritance were revealed and the order of residence (for the widow) was cancelled, and she could spend her period of the 'Iddah wherever she would like, and she was no longer entitled to be accommodated by her husband's family.

I said to Ibn ‘Umar, "If a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse (what is the judgment)?" He said, "Alláh's Prophet separated the couple of Bani 'Ajlan (when the husband accused his wife for an illegal sexual intercourse). The Prophet said, 'Alláh knows that one of you two IS a liar; so will one of you repent?' But they refused. He then again said, 'Alláh knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?' But they refused, whereupon he separated them by divorce." Aiyub (a sub-narrator) said: 'Amr bin Dinar said to me, "In the narration there is something which I do not see you mentioning, i.e. the husband said, "What about my money (Mahr)?' The Prophet said, "You are not entitled to take back money, for if you told the truth you have already entered upon her (and consummated your marriage with her) and if you are a liar then you are less entitled to take it back.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#7:262 .italic}

The Prophet said to those who were involved in a case of Lian, "Your accounts are with Alláh. One of you two is a liar. You (husband) have right on her (wife)." The husband said, "My money, O Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "You are not entitled to take back any money. If you have told the truth, the Mahr that you paid, was for having sexual relations with her lawfully; and if you are a liar, then you are less entitled to get it back."

He said, "No." I said, "One third of it?" He said, "One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for you'd better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor, begging of others.

Anyhow Alláh may let you recover, so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you."

Narrated by Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan {#7:271 .italic}

Once I set out to visit ‘Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, "Uthman AbdurRahman (bin 'Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking permission (to meet you)." ‘Umar said, "Yes. So he admitted them and they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came again and said to ‘Umar 'Shall I admit ‘Alí and ‘Abbás?" ‘Umar said, "Yes." He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat down. ‘Abbás said, "O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and this (‘Alí)." The group, 'Uthman and his companions Sad, 'O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other." ‘Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Alláh, by Whose permission both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Alláh's Apostle said. 'We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.' And by that Alláh's Apostles meant himself?" The group said, "He did say so." ‘Umar then turned towards 'All and ‘Abbás and said. "I beseech you both by Alláh, do you know that Alláh's Apostle said that?" They said, 'Yes " ‘Umar said, "Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Alláh favored His Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not give to anybody else. And Alláh said:-- 'And what Alláh has bestowed on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Alláh is Able to do all things.' (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Alláh's Apostle. But by Alláh he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of this property Alláh's Apostle used to provide his family with their yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Alláh's Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Alláh's Apostle kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by Alláh, do you know that?" They said, "Yes." Then ‘Umar said to ‘Alí and ‘Abbás, "I beseech you by Alláh, do you both know that?" They said, "Yes." ‘Umar added, "When Alláh had taken His Apostle unto Him, Abu Bakr said, 'I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle. So he took charge of that property and did with it the same what Alláh's Apostle used to do, and both of you knew all about it then." Then ‘Umar turned towards ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "You both claim that Abú- Bakr was so-and-so! But Alláh knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and right (in that matter). Then Alláh caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said, 'I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I used to do the same with it as Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do. Later both of you (‘Alí and ‘Abbás) came to me with the same claim and the same problem. (O ‘Abbás!) You came to me demanding your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (‘Alí) came to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, 'If you wish I will hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Alláh that you will manage it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.' So you both said, 'Hand over this property to us on this condition.' And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Alláh, did I hand it over to them on that condition?" The group said, "Yes." ‘Umar then faced ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "I beseech you both by Alláh, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?" They both said, "Yes." ‘Umar added, "Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf. "

Then he came and sat between me and her and I felt the coldness of his feet on my abdomen. He said, "Shall I direct you to something better than what you have requested? When you go to bed say 'Subhan Alláh' thirty-three times, 'Alhamdulillah' thirty three times, and Allahu Akbar' thirty four times, for that is better for you than a servant."

I conceived ‘Abdu’lláh bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba', and gave birth at Quba'. Then I brought the child to Alláh's Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Alláh's Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Alláh to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#7:379 .italic}

Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, "How does my son fare?" Um Salaim (his wife) replied, "He is quieter than he has ever been." Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), "Bury the child (as he's dead)." Next morning Abu Talha came to Alláh's Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), "Did you sleep with your wife last night?" Abu Talha said, "Yes". The Prophet said, "O Alláh! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs." Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, "Yes, a few dates." The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him ‘Abdu’lláh.

## Volume 7, Book 67

Narrated by Adi bin Hatim {#7:384 .italic}

I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi'rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, "If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death." I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, "If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Alláh's name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound."

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#7:385 .italic}

I asked Alláh's Apostle about the Mi'rad. He said, "If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but if the Mi'rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful)." I asked, "If I let loose my trained hound after a game?" He said, "If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Alláh, then you can eat." I said, "If the hound eats of the game?" He said "Then you should not eat of it, for the hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you." I said, "Some times I send my hound and then I find some other hound with it?" He said "Don't eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Alláh on your dog only and not on the other."

Narrated by Adi bin Hatim {#7:386 .italic}

I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We let loose our trained hounds after a game?" He said, "Eat what they hunt for you." I said, "Even if they killed (the game)?" He replied, 'Even if they killed (the game)." I said, 'We also hit (the game) with the Mi'rad?" He said, "Eat of the animal which the Mi'rad kills by piercing its body, but do not eat of the animal which is killed by the broad side of the Mi'rad.''

Narrated by Abu Tha'laba Al-Khushani {#7:387 .italic}

I said, "O Alláh's Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?" He said, "As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Alláh's Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Alláh's Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Maghaffal {#7:388 .italic}

That he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, "Do not throw stones, for Alláh's Apostle has forbidden throwing stones, or e used to dislike it." ‘Abdu’lláh added: Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth or gouge out an eye." Afterwards ‘Abdu’lláh once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, "I tell you that Alláh's Apostle has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet you are throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#7:389 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#7:390 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "If someone keeps a dog neither for hunting, nor for guarding livestock, the reward (for his good deeds) will be reduced by two Qirats per day."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#7:391 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "If someone keeps a dog neither for guarding livestock, nor for hunting, his good deeds will decrease (in reward) by two Qirats a day.'

Narrated by Adi bin Hatim {#7:392 .italic}

I asked Alláh's Apostle. "We hunt with the help of these hounds." He said, "If you let loose your trained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Alláh, then you can eat what the hounds catch for you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for then it is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound in hunting the game, then do not eat of it."

Narrated by Adi bin Hatim {#7:393 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Alláh's Name on sending it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Alláh's Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it." And it has also been narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet "If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?" The Prophet replied, "He can eat if he wishes."

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#7:394 .italic}

I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Alláh's Name on sending it." The Prophet said, "If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Alláh's Name on sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it has killed it for itself." I said, "Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game." He said, "You must not eat of it because you have not mentioned, the Name of Alláh except on sending your own hound, and you did not mention it on the other hound." Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi'rad (i.e. a sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, "If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side (shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a piece of wood."

Narrated by Adi Bin Hatim {#7:395 .italic}

I asked Alláh's Apostle, "We hunt with these hounds." He said, "If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Alláh's Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game."

Narrated by Abu Tha'laba Al-Khushani {#7:396 .italic}

I came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that." He said, "As for your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Alláh's Name while hunting, then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Alláh's Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#7:397 .italic}

When he had covered some of the way to Mecca, he and some companions of his, who were in the state of lhram. remained behind the Prophet while Abu Qatada himself was not in the state of Ihram. Abu Qatada, seeing an onager rode his horse and asked his companions to hand him a whip, but they refused. He then asked them to hand him his spear, but they refused. Then he took it himself and attacked the onager and killed it. Some of the Companions of Alláh's Apostle ate of it, but some others refused to eat. When they met Alláh's Apostle they asked him about that. He said, "It was meal given to you by Alláh."

I was with the Prophet (on a journey) between Mecca and Medina, and all of them, (i.e. the Prophet and his companions) were in the state of Ihram, while I was not in that state. I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, "What is that?" They said, "We do not know." I said, "It is an onager.' They said, "It is what you have seen." I had left my whip, so I said to them, "Hand to me my whip." They said, "We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager)." I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, "Come on, carry it!" But they said, "We will not even touch it." At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), "I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf)." When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, "Has anything of it been left with you?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Eat, for it is a meal Alláh has offered to you."

Then the sea threw a huge dead fish called Al-'Anbar, the like of which had never been seen. We ate of it for half a month, and then Abu 'Ubaida took one of its bones (and made an arch of it) so that a rider could easily pass under it.

The Prophet sent us as an army unit of three hundred warriors under the command of Abu 'Ubaida to ambush a caravan of the Quraish.

Then the sea threw a huge fish called Al-'Anbar and we ate of it for half a month and rubbed our bodies with its fat till our bodies became healthy. Then Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs and fixed it over the ground and a rider passed underneath it. There was a man amongst us who slaughtered three camels when hunger became severe, and he slaughtered three more, but after that Abu 'Ubaida forbade him to do so.

Then he distributed the animals, regarding ten sheep as equal to one camel. One of the camels ran away and there were a few horses with the people. They chased the camel but they got tired, whereupon a man shot it with an arrow whereby Alláh stopped it. The Prophet said, "Among these animals some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away from you, treat it in this way." I said. "We hope, or we are afraid that tomorrow we will meet the enemy and we have no knives, shall we slaughter (our animals) with canes?" The Prophet said, "If the killing tool causes blood to gush out and if Alláh's Name is mentioned, eat (of the slaughterer animal). But do not slaughter with a tooth or a nail. I am telling you why: A tooth is a bone, and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians."

So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, "Alláh's Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Alláh, if we do not remind Alláh's Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful." So we returned to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.' He said, 'It is Alláh Who has given you mounts.

Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Alláh stopped it. The Prophet said, "Of these animals there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot it with an arrow)."

Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we have no knives." He said, "Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Alláh's Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians."

(On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, "I have got a six month old ram." The Prophet said, 'Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you).

The Prophet then asked, "Which month is this?" We said, "Alláh and his Apostle know better." He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, "Isn't it the month of Dhul-Hijja?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Which town is this?" We said, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, "isn't it the town (of Mecca)?" We replied, "Yes." He said, "What day is today?" We replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, "Isn't it the day of Nahr?" We replied, "Yes." He then said, "Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly."

Alláh's Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good fresh water. When the Holy Verse: 'By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.' (3.92) was revealed, Abu Talha got up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh says: By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend of that which you love,' and the dearest of my property to me is the Bairuha garden and I want to give it in charity in Alláh's Cause, seeking to be rewarded by Alláh for that. So you can spend it, O Alláh's Apostle, where-ever Alláh instructs you. ' Alláh s Apostle said, "Good! That is a perishable (or profitable) wealth" (‘Abdu’lláh is in doubt as to which word was used.) He said, "I have heard what you have said but in my opinion you'd better give it to your kith and kin." On that Abu Talha said, "I will do so, O Alláh's Apostle!" Abu Talha distributed that garden among his kith and kin and cousins.

Then he added, "We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Alláh mentioned their rights, we used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, 'Strange! You can retort in this way?' She said, 'Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Alláh's Apostle?' So I went to Hafsa and said to her, 'I warn you not to disobey Alláh and His Apostle.' I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, 'O ‘Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Alláh's Apostle and his wives.' So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Alláh's Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Alláh's Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Alláh's Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, 'A great event has happened!' I asked him, 'What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?' He said, 'Greater than that! Alláh's Apostle has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, "Ask the permission for me to enter." He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Alláh's Apostle smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down." (See Ḥadít_h No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)

I had my parents who were very old and I had small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd.

And one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn't return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my feet. So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Alláh!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky.' So Alláh made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the second person said, 'O Alláh! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with her), she said, 'O Alláh's slave! Be afraid of Alláh ! Do not deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Alláh! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.' So Alláh shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said 'O Alláh ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. '(O Alláh's slave!) Be afraid o Alláh, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.' I said (to him). 'Go and take those cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Alláh!) If You considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.' And so Alláh released them (from their difficulty)."

The Prophet continued for such-and-such period imagining that he has slept (had sexual relations) with his wives, and in fact he did not. One day he said, to me, "O 'Aisha! Alláh has instructed me regarding a matter about which I had asked Him. There came to me two men, one of them sat near my feet and the other near my head. The one near my feet, asked the one near my head (pointing at me), 'What is wrong with this man? The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The first one asked, 'Who had worked magic on him?' The other replied, 'Lubaid bin Asam.' The first one asked, 'What material (did he use)?' The other replied, 'The skin of the pollen of a male date tree with a comb and the hair stuck to it, kept under a stone in the well of Dharwan."' Then the Prophet went to that well and said, "This is the same well which was shown to me in the dream. The tops of its date-palm trees look like the heads of the devils, and its water looks like the Henna infusion." Then the Prophet ordered that those things be taken out. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Won't you disclose (the magic object)?" The Prophet said, "Alláh has cured me and I hate to circulate the evil among the people." 'Aisha added, "(The magician) Lubaid bin Asam was a man from Bani Zuraiq, an ally of the Jews."

Be brothers (as Alláh has ordered you!")

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:95 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying. "All the sins of my followers will be forgiven except those of the Mujahirin (those who commit a sin openly or disclose their sins to the people). An example of such disclosure is that a person commits a sin at night and though Alláh screens it from the public, then he comes in the morning, and says, 'O so-and-so, I did such-and-such (evil) deed yesterday,' though he spent his night screened by his Lord (none knowing about his sin) and in the morning he removes Alláh's screen from himself."

A man asked Ibn ‘Umar, "What did you hear Alláh's Apostle saying regarding An-Najwa (secret talk between Alláh and His believing worshipper on the Day of Judgment)?" He said, "(The Prophet said), "One of you will come close to his Lord till He will shelter him in His screen and say: Did you commit such-and-such sin? He will say, 'Yes.' Then Alláh will say: Did you commit such and such sin? He will say, 'Yes.' So Alláh will make him confess (all his sins) and He will say, 'I screened them (your sins) for you in the world, and today I forgive them for you."'

Al-Khuzai: The Prophet said, "Shall I inform you about the people of Paradise?

Anas bin Malik said, "Any of the female slaves of Medina could take hold of the hand of Alláh's Apostle and take him wherever she wished."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:98 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) that she was told that ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair (on hearing that she was selling or giving something as a gift) said, "By Alláh, if 'Aisha does not give up this, I will declare her incompetent to dispose of her wealth." I said, "Did he (‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair) say so?" They (people) said, "Yes." 'Aisha said, "I vow to Alláh that I will never speak to Ibn Az-Zubair." When this desertion lasted long, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair sought intercession with her, but she said, "By Alláh, I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him, and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow." When this state of affairs was prolonged on Ibn Az-Zubair (he felt it hard on him), he said to Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin 'Abu Yaghuth, who were from the tribe of Bani Zahra, "I beseech you, by Alláh, to let me enter upon 'Aisha, for it is unlawful for her to vow to cut the relation with me." So Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman, wrapping their sheets around themselves, asked 'Aisha's permission saying, "Peace and Alláh's Mercy and Blessings be upon you! Shall we come in?" 'Aisha said, "Come in." They said, "All of us?" She said, "Yes, come in all of you," not knowing that Ibn Az-Zubair was also with them. So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of 'Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and 'Abdur Rahman also started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said (to her), "The Prophet forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days)." So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others' sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, "I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one." They (Al-Miswar and 'Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with ‘Abdu’lláh bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.

Narrated by Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari {#8:100 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "It is not lawful for a man to desert his brother Muslim for more than three nights.

(the wife of the Prophet) "I do not remember my parents believing in any religion other than the Religion (of Islam), and our being visited by Alláh's Apostle in the morning and in the evening.

Some time passed after this event, and then the Prophet sent a (similar) cloak to him. ‘Umar brought that cloak back to the Prophet and said, 'You have sent this to me, and you said about a similar one what you said?'

I was Rifa'a's wife and he divorced me thrice, and then I was married to 'Abdur-Rahman bin AzZubair, who, by Alláh has nothing with him except something like this fringe, O Alláh's Apostle," showing a fringe she had taken from her covering sheet. Abu Bakr was sitting with the Prophet while Khalid Ibn Said bin Al-As was sitting at the gate of the room waiting for admission. Khalid started calling Abu Bakr, "O Abu Bakr! Why don't you reprove this lady from what she is openly saying before Alláh's Apostle?" Alláh's Apostle did nothing except smiling, and then said (to the lady), "Perhaps you want to go back to Rifa'a? No, (it is not possible), unless and until you enjoy the sexual relation with him ('Abdur Rahman), and he enjoys the sexual relation with you."

Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you !" The Prophet said, "I am astonished at these women who were with me. As soon as they heard your voice, they hastened to screen themselves." ‘Umar said, "You have more right, that they should be afraid of you, O Alláh's Apostle!" And then he (‘Umar) turned towards them and said, "O enemies of your souls! You are afraid of me and not of Alláh's Apostle?" The women replied, "Yes, for you are sterner and harsher than Alláh's Apostle." Alláh's Apostle said, "O Ibn Al-Khattab!

On that Abu Barza came to us and said, "Since the time I left Alláh's Apostle, nobody has admonished me; My house is very far from this place, and if I had carried on praying and left my horse, I could not have reached my house till night." Then Abu Barza mentioned that he had been in the company of the Prophet, and that he had seen his leniency.

'Abdur-Rahman said, "Take your meal." They said, "We will not eat till the owner of the house comes." 'Abdur-Rahman said, "Accept your meal from us, for if my father comes and finds you not having taken your meal yet, we will be blamed severely by him, but they refused to take their meals. So I was sure that my father would be angry with me. When he came, I went away (to hide myself) from him. He asked, "What have you done (about the guests)?" They informed him the whole story. Abu Bakr called, "O 'Abdur Rahman!" I kept quiet. He then called again. "O 'Abdur-Rahman!" I kept quiet and he called again, "O ignorant (boy)! I beseech you by Alláh, if you hear my voice, then come out!" I came out and said, "Please ask your guests (and do not be angry with me)." They said, "He has told the truth; he brought the meal to us." He said, "As you have been waiting for me, by Alláh, I will not eat of it tonight." They said, "By Alláh, we will not eat of it till you eat of it." He said, I have never seen a night like this night in evil. What is wrong with you? Why don't you accept your meals of hospitality from us?" (He said to me), "Bring your meal." I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, "In the name of Alláh.

Abu Bakr became angry, rebuked me and invoked Alláh to cause (my) ears to be cut and swore not to eat of it!" I hid myself, and he called me, "O ignorant (boy)!" Abu Bakr's wife swore that she would not eat of it and so the guests or the guest swore that they would not eat of it till he ate of it. Abu Bakr said, "All that happened was from Satan." So he asked for the meals and ate of it, and so did they. Whenever they took a handful of the meal, the meal grew (increased) from underneath more than that mouthful. He said (to his wife), "O, sister of Bani Firas! What is this?" She said, "O, pleasure of my eyes!

They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! They are disbelievers (and they will take a false oath)." Then Alláh's Apostle himself paid the blood money to them.

When nobody spoke, the Prophet said, "It is the date-palm tree" When I came out with my father, I said, "O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree." He said, "What prevented you from saying it?" Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune)."

'Amir was a poet, and so he got down and started (chanting Huda) reciting for the people, poetry that keep pace with the camel's foot steps, saying, "O Alláh! Without You we would not have been guided on the right path, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed. Let all of us be sacrificed for Your cause and when we meet our enemy, make our feet firm and bestow peace and calmness on us and if they (our enemy) will call us towards an unjust thing we will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and cry to ask others help against us. Alláh's Apostle said, "Who is that driver (of the camels)?" They said, "He is 'Amir bin Al-Aqwa."' He said, "May Alláh bestow His mercy on him." A man among the people said, Has Martyrdom been granted to him, O Alláh's Prophet! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer." We reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were stricken with severe hunger but Alláh helped the Muslims conquer Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. Alláh's Apostle asked, "What are those fires? For what are you making fires?" They said, "For cooking meat." He asked, "What kind of meat?" They said, "Donkeys' meat." Alláh's Apostle said, "Throw away the meat and break the cooking pots." A man said, O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?" He said, "You can do that too." When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), 'Amir's sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit 'Amir's knee and caused him to die. When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Alláh's Apostle saw me pale and said, 'What is wrong with you?"' I said, "Let my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds of Amir have been annulled." The Prophet asked, "Who said so?" I replied, "So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari said, 'Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, 'Amir will have double reward."' (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers together to indicate that, and added, "He was really a hard-working man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Alláh's Cause) and rarely have there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an "Arab like him."

Then Alláh's Apostle entered upon me, and I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! The man has not nursed me but his wife has nursed me." He said, "Admit him because he is your uncle (not from blood relation, but because you have been nursed by his wife), Taribat Yaminuki."

Narrated by Usama bin Zaid {#8:226 .italic}

That Alláh's Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa'd bin 'Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha. When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, "Do not cover us with dust." Alláh's Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Alláh (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur’án. On that ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, "O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him." On that ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha said "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Alláh's Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Alláh's Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa'd bin 'Ubada. Alláh's Apostle said, "O Sa'd! Didn't you hear what Abu Habab said?" (meaning ‘Abdu’lláh bin Unbar). "He said so-and-so." Sa'd bin Ubada said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Alláh sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai) as their ruler. So when Alláh had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed." So Alláh's Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Alláh's Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Alláh ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Alláh said: 'You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you.....and from the pagans (3.186) He also said: 'Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. .... (2.109) So Alláh's Apostle used to apply what Alláh had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Alláh's Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Alláh killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Alláh's Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, "This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Alláh's Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)". Then they became Muslims.

He (‘Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling of women.) So Alláh revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover excluding the eyes). (See Ḥadít_h No. 148, Vol. 1)

A man peeped through a round hole into the dwelling place of the Prophet, while the Prophet had a Midray (an iron comb) with which he was scratching his head. the Prophet said, " Had known you were looking (through the hole), I would have pierced your eye with it (i.e., the comb)." Verily! The order of taking permission to enter has been enjoined because of that sight, (that one should not look unlawfully at the state of others). (See Ḥadít_h No. 807, Vol. 7)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:260 .italic}

I have not seen a thing resembling 'lamam' (minor sins) than what Abu Huraira 'narrated from the Prophet who said "Alláh has written for Adam's son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing), the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it."

(When ‘Umar came to know about it) he said to Abu Musa, "Why did you not enter?'. Abu Musa replied, "I asked permission three times, and I was not given it, so I returned, for Alláh's Apostle said, "If anyone of you asks the permission to enter thrice, and the permission is not given, then he should return.' " ‘Umar said, "By Alláh! We will ask Abu Musa to bring witnesses for it." (Abu Musa went to a gathering of the Ansar and said). "Did anyone of you hear this from the Prophet ?" Ubai bin Ka'b said, "By Alláh, none will go with you but the youngest of the people (as a witness)." (Abu Said) was the youngest of them, so I went with Abu Musa and informed ‘Umar that the Prophet had said so. (See Ḥadít_h No. 277, Vol. 3)

She used to pull out the silq (a kind of vegetable) from its roots and put it in a cooking pot, adding some powdered barley over it (and cook it). After finishing the Jumua (Friday) prayer we used to (pass by her and) greet her, whereupon she would present us with that meal, so we used to feel happy because of that. We used to have neither a midday nap, nor meals, except after the Friday prayer." (See Ḥadít_h No. 60, Vol.2)

A man entered the mosque while Alláh's Apostle was sitting in one side of the mosque. The man prayed, came, and greeted the Prophet. Alláh's Apostle said to him, "Wa 'Alaikas Salam (returned his greeting). Go back and pray as you have not prayed (properly)." The man returned, repeated his prayer, came back and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet said, "Wa alaika-s-Salam (returned his greeting). Go back and pray again as you have not prayed (properly)." The man said at the second or third time, "O Alláh's Apostle! Kindly teach me how to pray". The Prophet said, "When you stand for prayer, perform ablution properly and then face the Qibla and say Takbir (Allahu-Akbar), and then recite what you know from the Qur’án, and then bow with calmness till you feel at ease then rise from bowing, till you stand straight, and then prostrate calmly (and remain in prostration) till you feel at ease, and then raise (your head) and sit with calmness till you feel at ease and then prostrate with calmness (and remain in prostration) till you feel at ease, and then raise (your head) and sit with calmness till you feel at ease in the sitting position, and do likewise in whole of your prayer."

Narrated by 'Urwa-bin Az-Zubair {#8:271 .italic}

Usama bin Zaid said, "The Prophet rode over a donkey with a saddle underneath which there was a thick soft Fadakiya velvet sheet. Usama bin Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa'd bin Ubada (who was sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai bin Salul, and there was ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that gathering, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai covered his nose with his Riḍá (sheet) and said (to the Prophet), "Don't cover us with dust." The Prophet greeted them and then stopped, dismounted and invited them to Alláh (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the Holy Qur’án. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai' bin Salul said, "O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to him." On that ‘Abdu’lláh bin Rawaha said, "(O Alláh's Apostle!) Come to us and bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that." So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa'd bin 'Ubada, he said, "O Sa'd, didn't you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ubai). He said so-and-so." Sa'd bin 'Ubada said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Alláh, Alláh has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Alláh prevented that with the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the way you saw him behaving." So the Prophet excused him.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ka'b {#8:272 .italic}

I heard Ka'b bin Malik narrating (when he did not join the battle of Tabuk): Alláh's Apostle forbade all the Muslims to speak to us. I would come to Alláh's Apostle and greet him, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips to return to my greetings or not till fifty nights passed away. The Prophet then announced (to the people) Alláh's forgiveness for us (acceptance of our repentance) at the time when he had offered the Fajr (morning) prayer.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:273 .italic}

A group of Jews came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "As-samu 'Alaika " (Death be on you), and I understood it and said to them, "Alaikum AsSamu wa-l-la'na (Death and curse be on you)." Alláh's Apostle said, "Be calm! O 'Aisha, for Alláh loves that one should be kind and lenient in all matters." I said. "O Alláh's Apostle! Haven't you heard what they have said?" Alláh's Apostle said, "I have (already) said (to them), 'Alaikum (upon you).' "

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#8:274 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu Marthad Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, "Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin Abi Balta'a to the pagans (of Mecca)." So we overtook her while she was proceeding on her camel at the same place as Alláh's Apostle told us. We said (to her) "Where is the letter which is with you?" She said, "I have no letter with me." So we made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find anything. My two companions said, "We do not see any letter." I said, "I know that Alláh's Apostle did not tell a lie. By Alláh, if you (the lady) do not bring out the letter, I will strip you of your clothes' When she noticed that I was serious, she put her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Alláh's Apostle with the letter. The Prophet said (to Habib), "What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?" Hatib replied, "I have done nothing except that I believe in Alláh and His Apostle, and I have not changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of Mecca) through which Alláh might protect my family and my property, as there is none among your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Alláh protects his property (against harm). The Prophet said, "Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him (anything) but good." ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "Verily he has betrayed Alláh, His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!" The Prophet said, "O ‘Umar! What do you know; perhaps Alláh looked upon the Badr warriors and said, 'Do whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'" On that ‘Umar wept and said, "Alláh and His Apostle know best."

Peace be on us and on the pious slaves of Alláh, I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, and I also testify that Muḥammad is Alláh's slave and His Apostle.

‘Alí bin Abu Talib came out of the house of the Prophet during his fatal ailment. The people asked (‘Alí), "O Abu Ḥasan! How is the health of Alláh's Apostle this morning?" ‘Alí said, "This morning he is better, with the grace of Alláh." Al-‘Abbás held ‘Alí by the hand and said, "Don't you see him (about to die)? By Alláh, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e., under the command of another ruler). By Alláh, I think that Alláh's Apostle will die from his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of ‘Abdu’l- Muttalib. So let us go to Alláh's Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will request him to recommend us to him. " ‘Alí said, "By Alláh! If we ask Alláh's Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us. Besides, I will never ask Alláh's Apostle for it." (See Ḥadít_h No 728, Vol 5)

I replied, "No." He said, Alláh's Right on His slaves is that they should worship Him (Alone) and should not join partners in worship with Him." He said, "O Mu'adh!" I replied, "Labbaik wa Sa'daik." He said, "Do you know what the right of (Alláh's) salves on Alláh is, if they do that (worship Him Alone and join none in His worship)? It is that He will not punish them."

I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole amount) among Alláh's slaves like this and like this and like this." The Prophet pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, "O Abu Dhar!" I replied, "Labbaik wa Sa'daik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Those who have much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity)." Then he ordered me, "Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back." He went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something might have happened to Alláh's Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I remembered the statement of Alláh's Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, "That was Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without joining others in worship with Alláh, would enter Paradise."

The Prophet added.

‘Abdu’lláh bin Mas'ud related to us two narrations: One from the Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall on him; whereas the wicked person considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like this." Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration. (Ibn Mas'ud added): Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Alláh wished (him to suffer from). He then says, 'I will go back to my place.' He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him."

Amantu bikitabi kalladhi anzalta wa bi nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta'. If you should die then (after reciting this) you will die on the religion of Islam (i.e., as a Muslim); so let these words be the last you say (before going to bed)" While I was memorizing it, I said, "Wa birasiulikal-ladhi arsalta (in Your Apostle whom You have sent).'

I got up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that I was watching him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, stood on his left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered thirteen Rak'at in all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the Prophet of the approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer without performing new ablution. He used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij'al fi qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam'i nuran, wa'an yamini nuran, wa'an yasari nuran, wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj'al li nuran." Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, "I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet mentioned in this invocation).

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:377 .italic}

Two old ladies from among the Jewish ladies entered upon me and said' "The dead are punished in their graves," but I thought they were telling a lie and did not believe them in the beginning.

He said, "They told the truth; the dead are really punished, to the extent that all the animals hear (the sound resulting from) their punishment." Since then I always saw him seeking refuge with Alláh from the punishment of the grave in his prayers.

He said, 'No.' I said, 'Then 1/2 of it?' He said, 'Even 1/3 is too much, for, to leave your inheritors wealthy is better than to leave them in poverty, begging from people. And (know that) whatever you spend in Alláh's Cause, you will get reward for it, even for the morsel of food which you put in your wife's mouth.' I said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Will I be left behind my companions (in Mecca)?' He said, 'If you remain behind, whatever good deed you will do for Alláh's Sake, will raise and upgrade you to a higher position (in Alláh's Sight). May be you will live longer so that some people may benefit by you, and some e others (pagans) may get harmed by you. O Alláh! Complete the migration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels; But (we pity) the poor Sa'd bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sa'd) (died in Mecca)" Alláh's Apostle lamented (or pitied) for him as he died in Mecca.

That Alláh's Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, "O 'Aisha!) Do you know that Alláh has advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?" 'Aisha said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What's that?" He said, "Two men came to me and one of them sat at my head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, 'What is wrong with this man?' The latter replied, 'He is under the effect of magic.' The former asked, 'Who has worked magic on him?' The latter replied, 'Labid bin Al-A'sam.' The former asked, 'With what did he work the magic?' The latter replied, 'With a comb and the hair, which are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.' The former asked, 'Where is that?' The latter replied, 'It is in Dharwan.' Dharwan was a well in the dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Alláh's Apostle went to that well and returned to 'Aisha, saying, 'By Alláh, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.' 'Aisha added, Alláh's Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, 'O Alláh's Apostle, why didn't you take out the skin of pollen?' He said, 'As for me, Alláh has cured me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn and harm others with).' " Narrated Hisham's father: 'Aisha said, "Alláh's Apostle was bewitched, so he invoked Alláh repeatedly requesting Him to cure him from that magic)." Hisham then narrated the above narration.

Be gentle and beware of being harsh and of saying evil things." She said, "Didn't you hear what they said?"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:417 .italic}

Alláh 's Apostle said, "Alláh has some angels who look for those who celebrate the Praises of Alláh on the roads and paths. And when they find some people celebrating the Praises of Alláh, they call each other, saying, "Come to the object of your pursuit.' " He added, "Then the angels encircle them with their wings up to the sky of the world." He added. "(after those people celebrated the Praises of Alláh, and the angels go back), their Lord, asks them (those angels)... though He knows better than them... 'What do My slaves say?' The angels reply, 'They say: Subhan Alláh, Allahu Akbar, and Alham-du-lillah, Alláh then says 'Did they see Me?' The angels reply, 'No! By Alláh, they didn't see You.' Alláh says, How it would have been if they saw Me?' The angels reply, 'If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and celebrate Your Glory more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance to anything more often.' Alláh says (to the angels), 'What do they ask Me for?' The angels reply, 'They ask You for Paradise.' Alláh says (to the angels), 'Did they see it?' The angels say, 'No! By Alláh, O Lord! They did not see it.' Alláh says, How it would have been if they saw it?' The angels say, 'If they saw it, they would have greater covetousness for it and would seek It with greater zeal and would have greater desire for it.' Alláh says, 'From what do they seek refuge?' The angels reply, 'They seek refuge from the (Hell) Fire.' Alláh says, 'Did they see it?' The angels say, 'No By Alláh, O Lord! They did not see it.' Alláh says, How it would have been if they saw it?' The angels say, 'If they saw it they would flee from it with the extreme fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.' Then Alláh says, 'I make you witnesses that I have forgiven them."' Alláh's Apostle added, "One of the angels would say, 'There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was not one of them, but he had just come for some need.' Alláh would say, 'These are those people whose companions will not be reduced to misery.' "

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari {#8:418 .italic}

The Prophet started ascending a high place or hill. A man (amongst his companions) ascended it and shouted in a loud voice, "La ilaha illal-lahu wallahu Akbar."

Then ‘Abdu’lláh came out, holding the hand of Yazíd, addressed us, saying, "I know that you are assembled here, but the reason that prevents me from coming out to you, is that Alláh's Apostle used to preach to us at intervals during the days, lest we should become bored."

The Prophet said, "The pleasures of the world." A man said, "Can the good bring forth evil?" The Prophet kept quiet for a while till we thought that he was being inspired divinely. Then he started removing the sweat from his forehead and said," Where is the questioner?" That man said, "I (am present)." Abu Sa‘íd added: We thanked the man when the result (of his question) was such. The Prophet said, "Good never brings forth but good. This wealth (of the world) is (like) green and sweet (fruit), and all the vegetation which grows on the bank of a stream either kills or nearly kills the animal that eats too much of it, except the animal that eats the Khadira (a kind of vegetation). Such an animal eats till its stomach is full and then it faces the sun and starts ruminating and then it passes out dung and urine and goes to eat again. This worldly wealth is (like) sweet (fruit), and if a person earns it (the wealth) in a legal way and spends it properly, then it is an excellent helper, and whoever earns it in an illegal way, he will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied."

'Imran bin Ḥusayn said: The Prophet said, "The best people are my contemporaries (i.e., the present (my) generation) and then those who come after them (i.e., the next generation)." Imran added: I am not sure whether the Prophet repeated the statement twice after his first saying. The Prophet added, "And after them there will come people who will bear witness, though they will not be asked to give their witness; and they will be treacherous and nobody will trust them, and they will make vows, but will not fulfill them, and fatness will appear among them."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#8:437 .italic}

I heard Khabbab, who had branded his abdomen with seven brands, saying, "Had Alláh's Apostle not forbidden us to invoke Alláh for death, I would have invoked Alláh for death. The companions of Muḥammad have left this world without taking anything of their reward in it (i.e., they will have perfect reward in the Hereafter), but we have collected of the worldly wealth what we cannot spend but on earth (i.e. on building houses)."

Narrated by Qais {#8:439 .italic}

I came to Khabbab while he was building a wall, and he (Khabbab) said, "Our companions who have left this world, did not enjoy anything of their reward therein, while we have collected after them, much wealth that we cannot spend but on earth (i.e., on building)."

I brought water to Uthman bin 'Affan to perform the ablution while he was sitting on his seat. He performed the ablution in a perfect way and said, "I saw the Prophet performing the ablution in this place and he performed it in a perfect way and said, "Whoever performs the ablution as I have done this time and then proceeds to the mosque and offers a two-Rak'at prayer and then sits there (waiting for the compulsory congregational prayers), then all his past sins will be forgiven." The Prophet further added, "Do not be conceited (thinking that your sins will be forgiven because of your prayer)."

I heard the Prophet saying, "If the son of Adam (the human being) had two valley of money, he would wish for a third, for nothing can fill the belly of Adam's son except dust, and Alláh forgives him who repents to Him."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:445 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "If the son of Adam had money equal to a valley, then he will wish for another similar to it, for nothing can satisfy the eye of Adam's son except dust. And Alláh forgives him who repents to Him." Ibn ‘Abbás said: I do not know whether this saying was quoted from the Qur’án or not. 'Ata' said, "I heard Ibn AzZubair saying this narration while he was on the pulpit."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sa'd {#8:446 .italic}

I heard Ibn Az-Zubair who was on the pulpit at Mecca, delivering a sermon, saying, "O men! The Prophet used to say, "If the son of Adam were given a valley full of gold, he would love to have a second one; and if he were given the second one, he would love to have a third, for nothing fills the belly of Adam's son except dust. And Alláh forgives he who repents to Him." Ubai said, "We considered this as a saying from the Qur’án till the Sura (beginning with) 'The mutual rivalry for piling up of worldly things diverts you..' (102.1) was revealed."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#8:447 .italic}

I asked the Prophet (for some money) and he gave me, and then again I asked him and he gave me, and then again I asked him and he gave me and he then said, "This wealth is (like) green and sweet (fruit), and whoever takes it without greed, Alláh will bless it for him, but whoever takes it with greed, Alláh will not bless it for him, and he will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied. And the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (taking) hand."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#8:449 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Who among you considers the wealth of his heirs dearer to him than his own wealth?" They replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! There is none among us but loves his own wealth more." The Prophet said, "So his wealth is whatever he spends (in Alláh's Cause) during his life (on good deeds) while the wealth of his heirs is whatever he leaves after his death."

Narrated by Abu Dhar {#8:450 .italic}

Once I went out at night and found Alláh's Apostle walking all alone accompanied by nobody, and I thought that perhaps he disliked that someone should accompany him. So I walked in the shade, away from the moonlight, but the Prophet looked behind and saw me and said, "Who is that?" I replied, "Abu Dhar, let Alláh get me sacrificed for you!" He said, "O Abu Dhar, come here!" So I accompanied him for a while and then he said, "The rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except him whom Alláh gives wealth which he gives (in charity) to his right, left, front and back, and does good deeds with it. I walked with him a little longer. Then he said to me, "Sit down here." So he made me sit in an open space surrounded by rocks, and said to me, "Sit here till I come back to you." He went towards Al-Harra till I could not see him, and he stayed away for a long period, and then I heard him saying, while he was coming, "Even if he had committed theft, and even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse?" When he came, I could not remain patient and asked him, "O Alláh's Prophet! Let Alláh get me sacrificed for you! Whom were you speaking to by the side of Al-Harra? I did not hear anybody responding to your talk." He said, "It was Gabriel who appeared to me beside Al-Harra and said, 'Give the good news to your followers that whoever dies without having worshipped anything besides Alláh, will enter Paradise.' I said, 'O Gabriel! Even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Even if he has committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Even if he has committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse?' He said, 'Yes.' "

Narrated by Abu Dhar {#8:451 .italic}

While I was walking with the Prophet in the Harra of Medina, Uhud came in sight. The Prophet said, "O Abu Dhar!" I said, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "I would not like to have gold equal to this mountain of Uhud, unless nothing of it, not even a single Dinar of it remains with me for more than three days, except something which I will keep for repaying debts. I would have spent all of it (distributed it) amongst Alláh's Slaves like this, and like this, and like this." The Prophet pointed out with his hand towards his right, his left and his back (while illustrating it). He proceeded with his walk and said, "The rich are in fact the poor (little rewarded) on the Day of Resurrection except those who spend their wealth like this, and like this, and like this, to their right, left and back, but such people are few in number." Then he said to me, "Stay at your place and do not leave it till I come back." Then he proceeded in the darkness of the night till he went out of sight, and then I heard a loud voice, and was afraid that something might have happened to the Prophet .1 intended to go to him, but I remembered what he had said to me, i.e. 'Don't leave your place till I come back to you,' so I remained at my place till he came back to me. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I heard a voice and I was afraid." So I mentioned the whole story to him. He said, "Did you hear it?" I replied, "Yes." He said, "It was Gabriel who came to me and said, 'Whoever died without joining others in worship with Alláh, will enter Paradise.' I asked (Gabriel), 'Even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse? Gabriel said, 'Yes, even if he had committed theft or committed illegal sexual intercourse."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:452 .italic}

Alláh Apostle said, "If I had gold equal to the mountain of Uhud, it would not please me that anything of it should remain with me after three nights (i.e., I would spend all of it in Alláh's Cause) except what I would keep for repaying debts."

A man passed by Alláh's Apostle and the Prophet asked a man sitting beside him, "What is your opinion about this (passer-by)?" He replied, "This (passer-by) is from the noble class of people. By Alláh, if he should ask for a lady's hand in marriage, he ought to be given her in marriage, and if he intercedes for somebody, his intercession will be accepted. Alláh's Apostle kept quiet, and then another man passed by and Alláh's Apostle asked the same man (his companion) again, "What is your opinion about this (second) one?" He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This person is one of the poor Muslims. If he should ask a lady's hand in marriage, no-one will accept him, and if he intercedes for somebody, no one will accept his intercession, and if he talks, no-one will listen to his talk." Then Alláh's Apostle said, "This (poor man) is better than such a large number of the first type (i.e. rich men) as to fill the earth."

Narrated by Abu Wail {#8:455 .italic}

We paid a visit to Khabbab who was sick, and he said, "We migrated with the Prophet for Alláh's Sake and our wages became due on Alláh. Some of us died without having received anything of the wages, and one of them was Mus'ab bin ‘Umar, who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, leaving only one sheet (to shroud him in). If we covered his head with it, his feet became uncovered, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became uncovered. So the Prophet ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (a kind of grass) over his feet. On the other hand, some of us have had the fruits (of our good deed) and are plucking them (in this world)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:459 .italic}

By Alláh except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet and h is companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Alláh's Book and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then ‘Umar passed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Alláh's Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by without doing so. Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet ) passed by me and he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, "O Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!" I replied, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said to me, "Follow me." He left and I followed him. Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, "From where is this milk?" They said, "It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such woman)." He said, "O Aba Hirr!" I said, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Go and call the people of Suffa to me." These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet , he would send it to them and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order off the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, "How will this little milk be enough for the people of As-Suffa?" thought I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself, but behold! The Prophet came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Alláh and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the Prophet's permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. The Prophet said, "O Aba-Hirr!" I said, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Take it and give it to them." So I took the bowl (of Milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. "O Aba Hirr!" I replied, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "There remain you and I." I said, "You have said the truth, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "Sit down and drink." I sat down and drank. He said, "Drink," and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said, "No. by Alláh Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my stomach)." He said, "Hand it over to me." When I gave him the bowl, he praised Alláh and pronounced Alláh's Name on it and drank the remaining milk.

I was the first man among the Arabs to throw an arrow for Alláh's Cause. We used to fight in Alláh's Cause while we had nothing to eat except the leaves of the Hubla and the Sumur trees (desert trees) so that we discharged excrement like that of sheep (i.e. unmixed droppings). Today the (people of the) tribe of Bani Asad teach me the laws of Islam. If so, then I am lost, and all my efforts of that hard time had gone in vain.

'Aisha said, "The two black things i.e. dates and water, except that Alláh's Apostle had neighbors from the Ansar who had some milch she-camels, and they used to give the Prophet some milk from their house, and he used to make us drink it."

Therefore, do good deeds properly, sincerely and moderately, and worship Alláh in the forenoon and in the afternoon and during a part of the night, and always adopt a middle, moderate, regular course whereby you will reach your target (Paradise)."

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, Verily Alláh created Mercy. The day He created it, He made it into one hundred parts. He withheld with Him ninety-nine parts, and sent its one part to all His creatures. Had the non-believer known of all the Mercy which is in the Hands of Alláh, he would not lose hope of entering Paradise, and had the believer known of all the punishment which is present with Alláh, he would not consider himself safe from the Hell-Fire."

Narrated by Abu Said {#8:477 .italic}

Some people from the Ansar asked Alláh's Apostle (to give them something) and he gave to everyone of them, who asked him, until all that he had was finished. When everything was finished and he had spent all that was in his hand, he said to them, '"(Know) that if I have any wealth, I will not withhold it from you (to keep for somebody else); And (know) that he who refrains from begging others (or doing prohibited deeds), Alláh will make him contented and not in need of others; and he who remains patient, Alláh will bestow patience upon him, and he who is satisfied with what he has, Alláh will make him self-sufficient.

Another man followed him and kept on following him till he (the fighter) was injured and, seeking to die quickly, he placed the blade tip of his sword between his breasts and leaned over it till it passed through his shoulders (i.e., committed suicide)." The Prophet added, "A person may do deeds that seem to the people as the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact, he is from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire: and similarly a person may do deeds that seem to the people as the deeds of the people of the (Hell) Fire while in fact, he is from the dwellers of Paradise. Verily, the (results of) deeds done, depend upon the last actions."

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#8:501 .italic}

A bedouin came to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who is the best of mankind!" The Prophet said, "A man who strives for Alláh's Cause with his life and property, and also a man who lives (all alone) in a mountain path among the mountain paths to worship his Lord and save the people from his evil."

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd {#8:502 .italic}

I heard from the Prophet saying, "There will come a time upon the people when the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he will take to the tops of mountains and to the places of rainfall, run away with his religion (in order to save it) from afflictions."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:503 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When honesty is lost, then wait for the Hour." It was asked, "How will honesty be lost, O Alláh's Apostle?" He said, "When authority is given to those who do not deserve it, then wait for the Hour."

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#8:504 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle narrated to us two narrations, one of which I have seen (happening) and I am waiting for the other. He narrated that honesty was preserved in the roots of the hearts of men (in the beginning) and then they learnt it (honesty) from the Qur’án, and then they learnt it from the (Prophet's) Sunna (tradition). He also told us about its disappearance, saying, "A man will go to sleep whereupon honesty will be taken away from his heart, and only its trace will remain, resembling the traces of fire. He then will sleep whereupon the remainder of the honesty will also be taken away (from his heart) and its trace will resemble a blister which is raised over the surface of skin, when an ember touches one's foot; and in fact, this blister does not contain anything. So there will come a day when people will deal in business with each other but there will hardly be any trustworthy persons among them. Then it will be said that in such-and-such a tribe there is such-and-such person who is honest, and a man will be admired for his intelligence, good manners and strength, though indeed he will not have belief equal to a mustard seed in his heart." The narrator added: There came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim, his religion would prevent him from cheating; and if he was a Christian, his Muslim ruler would prevent him from cheating; but today I cannot deal except with so-and-so and so-and-so. (See Ḥadít_h No. 208, Vol. 9)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#8:505 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "People are just like camels, out of one hundred, one can hardly find a single camel suitable to ride."

Narrated by Jundub {#8:506 .italic}

The Prophet said, "He who lets the people hear of his good deeds intentionally, to win their praise, Alláh will let the people know his real intention (on the Day of Resurrection), and he who does good things in public to show off and win the praise of the people, Alláh will disclose his real intention (and humiliate him).

Narrated by Mu'adh bin Jabal {#8:507 .italic}

While I was riding behind the Prophet as a companion rider and there was nothing between me and him except the back of the saddle, he said, "O Mu'adh!" I replied, "Labbaik O Alláh's Apostle! And Sa'diak!" He proceeded for a while and then said, "O Mu'adh!" I said, "Labbaik and Sa'daik, O Alláh's Apostle!" He then proceeded for another while and said, "O Mu'adh bin Jabal!" I replied, "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle, and Sa'daik!" He said, "Do you know what is Alláh's right on His slaves?" I replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." He said, "Alláh's right on his slaves is that they should worship Him and not worship anything besides Him." He then proceeded for a while, and again said, "O Mu'adh bin Jabal!" I replied. "Labbaik, O Alláh's Apostle, and Sa'daik." He said, "Do you know what is (Alláh's) slaves' (people's) right on Alláh if they did that?" I replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know better." He said, "The right of (Alláh's) slaves on Alláh is that He should not punish them (if they did that)."

Narrated by Anas {#8:508 .italic}

The Prophet had a she-camel called Al'Adba' and it was too fast to surpass in speed. There came a bedouin riding a camel of his, and that camel outstripped it (i.e. Al-Aqba'). That result was hard on the Muslims who said sorrowfully, "Al- Adba has been outstripped." Alláh's Apostle said, "It is due from Alláh that nothing would be raised high in this world except that He lowers or puts it down."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:509 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh said, 'I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the most beloved things with which My slave comes nearer to Me, is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears, and his sense of sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he grips, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks Me, I will give him, and if he asks My protection (Refuge), I will protect him; (i.e. give him My Refuge) and I do not hesitate to do anything as I hesitate to take the soul of the believer, for he hates death, and I hate to disappoint him."

Narrated by Sahl {#8:510 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "I have been sent and the Hour (is at hand) as these two," showing his two fingers and sticking (separating) them out.

Narrated by Anas {#8:511 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "I have been sent and the Hour (is at hand) as these two (fingers)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:512 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I have been sent and the Hour (is at hand) as these two (fingers)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:513 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established till the sun rises from the west, and when it rises (from the west) and the people see it, then all of them will believe (in Alláh). But that will be the time when 'No good it will do to a soul to believe then. If it believed not before.."' (6.158) The Hour will be established (so suddenly) that two persons spreading a garment between them will not be able to finish their bargain, nor will they be able to fold it up. The Hour will be established while a man is carrying the milk of his she-camel, but cannot drink it; and the Hour will be established when someone is not able to prepare the tank to water his livestock from it; and the Hour will be established when some of you has raised his food to his mouth but cannot eat it."

Narrated by 'Ubada bin As-Samit {#8:514 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Who-ever loves to meet Alláh, Alláh (too) loves to meet him and who-ever hates to meet Alláh, Alláh (too) hates to meet him". 'Aisha, or some of the wives of the Prophet said, "But we dislike death." He said: It is not like this, but it is meant that when the time of the death of a believer approaches, he receives the good news of Alláh's pleasure with him and His blessings upon him, and so at that time nothing is dearer to him than what is in front of him. He therefore loves the meeting with Alláh, and Alláh (too) loves the meeting with him. But when the time of the death of a disbeliever approaches, he receives the evil news of Alláh's torment and His Requital, whereupon nothing is more hateful to him than what is before him. Therefore, he hates the meeting with Alláh, and Alláh too, hates the meeting with him."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#8:515 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Whoever loves the meeting with Alláh, Alláh too, loves the meeting with him; and whoever hates the meeting with Alláh, Alláh too, hates the meeting with him."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:516 .italic}

(the wife of the Prophet) When Alláh's Apostle was in good health, he used to say, "No prophet's soul is ever captured unless he is shown his place in Paradise and given the option (to die or survive)." So when the death of the Prophet approached and his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious for a while and then he came to his senses and fixed his eyes on the ceiling and said, "O Alláh (with) the highest companions." (See Qur’án 4:69). I said' "Hence he is not going to choose us." And I came to know that it was the application of the narration which he (the Prophet) used to narrate to us. And that was the last statement of the Prophet (before his death) i.e., "O Alláh! With the highest companions." (See Qur’án 4:69)

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:517 .italic}

There was a leather or wood container full of water in front of Alláh's Apostle (at the time of his death). He would put his hand into the water and rub his face with it, saying, "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh! No doubt, death has its stupors." Then he raised his hand and started saying, "(O Alláh!) with the highest companions." (See Qur’án 4:69) (and kept on saying it) till he expired and his hand dropped."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:518 .italic}

Some rough bedouins used to visit the Prophet and ask him, "When will the Hour be?" He would look at the youngest of all of them and say, "If this should live till he is very old, your Hour (the death of the people addressed) will take place." Hisham said that he meant (by the Hour), their death.

Narrated by Abu Qatada bin Rib'i Al-Ansari {#8:519 .italic}

A funeral procession passed by Alláh's Apostle who said, "Relieved or relieving?" The people asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is relieved and relieving?" He said, "A believer is relieved (by death) from the troubles and hardships of the world and leaves for the Mercy of Alláh, while (the death of) a wicked person relieves the people, the land, the trees, (and) the animals from him."

Narrated by Abu Qatada {#8:520 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Relieved or relieving. And a believer is relieved (by death)."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#8:521 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When carried to his grave, a dead person is followed by three, two of which return (after his burial) and one remains with him: his relative, his property, and his deeds follow him; relatives and his property go back while his deeds remain with him."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#8:522 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When anyone of you dies, his destination is displayed before him in the forenoon and in the afternoon, either in the (Hell) Fire or in Paradise, and it is said to him, "That is your place till you are resurrected and sent to it."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:523 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Do not abuse the dead, for they have reached the result of what they have done."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:524 .italic}

Two men, a Muslim and a Jew, abused each other. The Muslim said, "By Him Who gave superiority to Muḥammad over all the people." On that, the Jew said, "By Him Who gave superiority to Moses over all the people." The Muslim became furious at that and slapped the Jew in the face. The Jew went to Alláh's Apostle and informed him of what had happened between him and the Muslim. Alláh's Apostle said, "Don't give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold ! Moses will be there holding the side of Alláh's Throne. I will not know whether Moses has been among those people who have become unconscious and then has regained consciousness before me, or has been among those exempted by Alláh from falling unconscious."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:525 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The people will fall down unconscious at the time when they should fall down (i.e., on the Day of Resurrection), and then I will be the first man to get up, and behold, Moses will be there holding (Alláh's) Throne. I will not know whether he has been amongst those who have fallen unconscious."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:526 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Alláh will take the whole earth (in His Hand) and will roll up the Heaven in His right Hand, and then He will say, "I am King! Where are the kings of the earth ? "

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:527 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The (planet of) earth will be a bread on the Day of Resurrection, and The resistible (Alláh) will topple turn it with His Hand like anyone of you topple turns a bread with his hands while (preparing the bread) for a journey, and that bread will be the entertainment for the people of Paradise." A man from the Jews came (to the Prophet) and said, "May The Beneficent (Alláh) bless you, O Abu’l-Qásim! Shall I tell you of the entertainment of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection?" The Prophet said, "Yes." The Jew said, "The earth will be a bread," as the Prophet had said. Thereupon the Prophet looked at us and smiled till his premolar tooth became visible. Then the Jew further said, "Shall I tell you of the udm (additional food taken with bread) they will have with the bread?" He added, "That will be Balam and Nun." The people asked, "What is that?" He said, "It is an ox and a fish, and seventy thousand people will eat of the caudate lobe (i.e. extra lobe) of their livers."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sa'd {#8:528 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "The people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection on reddish white land like a pure loaf of bread (made of pure fine flour)." Sahl added: That land will have no landmarks for anybody (to make use of).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:529 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The people will be gathered in three ways: (The first way will be of) those who will wish or have a hope (for Paradise) and will have a fear (of punishment), (The second batch will be those who will gather) riding two on a camel or three on a camel or ten on a camel. (The third batch) the rest of the people will be urged to gather by the Fire which will accompany them at the time of their afternoon nap and stay with them where they will spend the night, and will be with them in the morning wherever they may be then, and will be with them in the afternoon wherever they may be then."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#8:530 .italic}

A man said, "O Alláh's Prophet! Will a Kafir (disbeliever) be gathered (driven prone) on his face?" The Prophet said, "Is not He Who made him walk with his legs in this world, able to make him walk on his face on the Day of Resurrection?" (Qatada, a sub-narrator said: Yes, (He can), by the Power of Our Lord!")

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:531 .italic}

The Prophet said, "You will meet Alláh barefooted, naked, walking on feet, and uncircumcised."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:532 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle while he was delivering a sermon on a pulpit, saying, "You will meet Alláh barefooted, naked, and uncircumcised."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:533 .italic}

The Prophet stood up among us and addressed (saying) "You will be gathered, barefooted, naked, and uncircumcised (as Alláh says): 'As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it..' (21.104) And the first human being to be dressed on the Day of Resurrection will be (the Prophet) Abraham Al-Khalil. Then will be brought some men of my followers who will be taken towards the left (i.e., to the Fire), and I will say: 'O Lord! My companions whereupon Alláh will say: You do not know what they did after you left them. I will then say as the pious slave, Jesus said, And I was witness over them while I dwelt amongst them...(up to) ...the All-Wise.' (5.117-118). The narrator added: Then it will be said that those people (relegated from Islam, that is) kept on turning on their heels (deserted Islam).

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:534 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The people will be gathered barefooted, naked, and uncircumcised." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Will the men and the women look at each other?" He said, "The situation will be too hard for them to pay attention to that."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#8:535 .italic}

While we were in the company of the Prophet in a tent he said, ''Would it please you to be one fourth of the people of Paradise?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Would It please you to be one-third of the people of Paradise?" We said, "Yes." He said, "Would it please you to be half of the people of Paradise?" We said, "Yes." Thereupon he said, "I hope that you will be one half of the people of Paradise, for none will enter Paradise but a Muslim soul, and you people, in comparison to the people who associate others in worship with Alláh, are like a white hair on the skin of a black ox, or a black hair on the skin of a red ox."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:536 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The first man to be called on the Day of Resurrection will be Adam who will be shown his offspring, and it will be said to them, 'This is your father, Adam.' Adam will say (responding to the call), 'Labbaik and Sa'daik' Then Alláh will say (to Adam), 'Take out of your offspring, the people of Hell.' Adam will say, 'O Lord, how many should I take out?' Alláh will say, 'Take out ninety-nine out of every hundred." They (the Prophet's companions) said, "O Alláh's Apostle! If ninety-nine out of every one hundred of us are taken away, what will remain out of us?" He said, "My followers in comparison to the other nations are like a white hair on a black ox."

Narrated by Abu Said {#8:537 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Alláh will say, 'O Adam!. Adam will reply, 'Labbaik and Sa'daik (I respond to Your Calls, I am obedient to Your orders), wal Khair fi Yadaik (and all the good is in Your Hands)!' Then Alláh will say (to Adam), Bring out the people of the Fire.' Adam will say, 'What (how many) are the people of the Fire?' Alláh will say, 'Out of every thousand (take out) nine-hundred and ninety-nine (persons).' At that time children will become hoary-headed and every pregnant female will drop her load (have an abortion) and you will see the people as if they were drunk, yet not drunk; But Alláh's punishment will be very severe." That news distressed the companions of the Prophet too much, and they said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who amongst us will be that man (the lucky one out of one-thousand who will be saved from the Fire)?" He said, "Have the good news that one-thousand will be from Gog and Magog, and the one (to be saved will be) from you." The Prophet added, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I Hope that you (Muslims) will be one third of the people of Paradise." On that, we glorified and praised Alláh and said, "Allahu Akbar." The Prophet then said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I hope that you will be one half of the people of Paradise, as your (Muslims) example in comparison to the other people (non-Muslims), is like that of a white hair on the skin of a black ox, or a round hairless spot on the foreleg of a donkey."

The Prophet said, "The cases which will be decided first (on the Day of Resurrection) will be the cases of blood-shedding."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:541 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Whoever has wronged his brother, should ask for his pardon (before his death), as (in the Hereafter) there will be neither a Dinar nor a Dirham. (He should secure pardon in this life) before some of his good deeds are taken and paid to his brother, or, if he has done no good deeds, some of the bad deeds of his brother are taken to be loaded on him (in the Hereafter)."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:542 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The believers, after being saved from the (Hell) Fire, will be stopped at a bridge between Paradise and Hell and mutual retaliation will be established among them regarding wrongs they have committed in the world against one another. After they are cleansed and purified (through the retaliation), they will be admitted into Paradise; and by Him in Whose Hand Muḥammad's soul is, everyone of them will know his dwelling in Paradise better than he knew his dwelling in this world."

Narrated by Abi Mulaika {#8:543 .italic}

'Aisha said, "The Prophet said, 'Anybody whose account (record) is questioned will surely be punished.' I said, 'Doesn't Alláh say: 'He surely will receive an easy reckoning?' (84.8) The Prophet replied. 'This means only the presentation of the account."'

The Prophet said (as above, 543).

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:545 .italic}

(84.7-8) Alláh's Apostle said, "That (Verse) means only the presentation of the accounts, but anybody whose account (record) is questioned on the Day of Resurrection, will surely be punished."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#8:546 .italic}

Alláh's Prophet used to say, "A disbeliever will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and will be asked. "Suppose you had as much gold as to fill the earth, would you offer it to ransom yourself?" He will reply, "Yes." Then it will be said to him, "You were asked for something easier than that (to join none in worship with Alláh (i.e. to accept Islam, but you refused)."

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#8:547 .italic}

The Prophet said, "There will be none among you but will be talked to by Alláh on the Day of Resurrection, without there being an interpreter between him and Him (Alláh) . He will look and see nothing ahead of him, and then he will look (again for the second time) in front of him, and the (Hell) Fire will confront him. So, whoever among you can save himself from the Fire, should do so even with one half of a date (to give in charity)."

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#8:548 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Protect yourself from the Fire." He then turned his face aside (as if he were looking at it) and said again, "Protect yourself from the Fire," and then turned his face aside (as if he were looking at it), and he said so for the third time till we thought he was looking at it. He then said, "Protect yourselves from the Fire, even if with one half of a date and he who hasn't got even this, (should do so) by (saying) a good, pleasant word.'

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:549 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The people were displayed in front of me and I saw one prophet passing by with a large group of his followers, and another prophet passing by with only a small group of people, and another prophet passing by with only ten (persons), and another prophet passing by with only five (persons), and another prophet passed by alone. And then I looked and saw a large multitude of people, so I asked Gabriel, "Are these people my followers?' He said, 'No, but look towards the horizon.' I looked and saw a very large multitude of people. Gabriel said. 'Those are your followers, and those are seventy thousand (persons) in front of them who will neither have any reckoning of their accounts nor will receive any punishment.' I asked, 'Why?' He said, 'For they used not to treat themselves with branding (cauterization) nor with Ruqya (get oneself treated by the recitation of some Verses of the Qur’án) and not to see evil omen in things, and they used to put their trust (only) in their Lord." On hearing that, 'Ukasha bin Mihsan got up and said (to the Prophet), "Invoke Alláh to make me one of them." The Prophet said, "O Alláh, make him one of them." Then another man got up and said (to the Prophet), "Invoke Alláh to make me one of them." The Prophet said, 'Ukasha has preceded you."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:550 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "From my followers there will enter Paradise a crowd, seventy thousand in number whose faces will glitter as the moon does when it is full." On hearing that, 'Ukasha bin Mihsan Al-Asdi got up, lifting his covering sheet, and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh that He may make me one of them." The Prophet said, "O Alláh, make him one of them." Another man from the Ansar got up and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh to make me one of them. "The Prophet said (to him), "'Ukasha has preceded you."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sa'd {#8:551 .italic}

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#8:552 .italic}

The Prophet; said, "The people of Paradise will enter Paradise, and the people of the (Hell) Fire will enter the (Hell) Fire: then a call-maker will get up (and make an announcement) among them, 'O the people of the (Hell) Fire!

And I stood at the gate of the Fire and found that the majority of the people entering it were women."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#8:556 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise and the people of the Fire have entered the Fire, death will be brought and will be placed between the Fire and Paradise, and then it will be slaughtered, and a call will be made (that), 'O people of Paradise, no more death ! O people of the Fire, no more death ! ' So the people of Paradise will have happiness added to their previous happiness, and the people of the Fire will have sorrow added to their previous sorrow."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:557 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh will say to the people of Paradise, 'O the people of Paradise!' They will say, 'Labbaik, O our Lord, and Sa'daik!' Alláh will say, 'Are you pleased?" They will say, 'Why should we not be pleased since You have given us what You have not given to anyone of Your creation?' Alláh will say, 'I will give you something better than that.' They will reply, 'O our Lord! And what is better than that?' Alláh will say, 'I will bestow My pleasure and contentment upon you so that I will never be angry with you after for-ever.' "

Narrated by Anas {#8:558 .italic}

Haritha was martyred on the day (of the battle) of Badr while he was young. His mother came to the Prophet saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! You know the relation of Haritha to me (how fond of him I was); so, if he is in Paradise, I will remain patient and wish for Alláh's reward, but if he is not there, then you will see what I will do."

He will reply, Yes. Alláh will say, 'I asked you a much easier thing than this while you were in the backbone of Adam, that is, not to worship others besides Me, but you refused and insisted to worship others besides Me."'

Narrated by Hammad from 'Amr from Jabir {#8:563 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Some people will come out of the Fire through intercession looking like The Thaarir." I asked 'Amr, "What is the Thaarir?" He said, Ad Daghabis, and at that time he was toothless. Hammad added: I said to 'Amr bin Dinar, "O Abu Muḥammad! Did you hear Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh saying, 'I heard the Prophet saying: 'Some people will come out of the Fire through intercession?" He said, "Yes. "

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#8:564 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Some people will come out of the Fire after they have received a touch of the Fire, changing their color, and they will enter Paradise, and the people of Paradise will name them 'Al-Jahannamiyin' the (Hell) Fire people."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:565 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise, and the people of the Fire have entered the Fire, Alláh will say. 'Take out (of the Fire) whoever has got faith equal to a mustard seed in his heart.' They will come out, and by that time they would have burnt and became like coal, and then they will be thrown into the river of Al-Hayyat (life) and they will spring up just as a seed grows on the bank of a rainwater stream." The Prophet said, "Don't you see that the germinating seed comes out yellow and twisted?"

Narrated by An-Nu'man {#8:566 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "The person who will have the least punishment from amongst the Hell Fire people on the Day of Resurrection, will be a man under whose arch of the feet a smoldering ember will be placed so that his brain will boil because of it."

Narrated by An-Nu'man bin Bashir {#8:567 .italic}

I heard the Prophet saying, "The least punished person of the (Hell) Fire people on the Day of Resurrection will be a man under whose arch of the feet two smoldering embers will be placed, because of which his brain will boil just like Al-Mirjal (copper vessel) or a Qum-qum (narrow-necked vessel) is boiling with water."

Narrated by 'Adi bin Hatim {#8:568 .italic}

The Prophet mentioned the Fire and turned his face aside and asked for Alláh's protection from it, and then again he mentioned the Fire and turned his face aside and asked for Alláh's protection from it and said, "Protect yourselves from the Hell-Fire, even if with one half of a date, and he who cannot afford that, then (let him do so) by (saying) a good, pleasant word."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:569 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostles when his uncle, Abu Talib had been mentioned in his presence, saying, "May be my intercession will help him (Abu Talib) on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be put in a shallow place in the Fire, with fire reaching his ankles and causing his brain to boil."

Narrated by Anas {#8:570 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Alláh will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection and they will say, 'Let us request someone to intercede for us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.' Then they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the one whom Alláh created with His Own Hands, and breathed in you of His soul, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you; so please intercede for us with our Lord.' Adam will reply, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, and will remember his sin, and will say, 'Go to Noah, the first Apostle sent by Alláh' They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking', and will remember his sin and say, 'Go to Abraham whom Alláh took as a Khalil. They will go to him (and request similarly). He will reply, 'I am not fit for this undertaking,' and will remember his sin and say, 'Go to Moses to whom Alláh spoke directly.' They will go to Moses and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking,' and will remember his sin and say, 'Go to Jesus.' They will go to him, and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muḥammad as Alláh has forgiven his past and future sins.' They will come to me and I will ask my Lord's permission, and when I see Him, I will fall down in prostration to Him, and He will leave me in that state as long as (He) Alláh will, and then I will be addressed. 'Raise up your head (O Muḥammad)! Ask, and your request will be granted, and say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' Then I will raise my head, and I will glorify and praise my Lord with a saying(i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede, Alláh will fix a limit for me (i.e., certain type of people for whom I may intercede), and I will take them out of the (Hell) Fire and let them enter Paradise. Then I will come back (to Alláh) and fall in prostration, and will do the same for the third and fourth times till no-one remains in the (Hell) Fire except those whom the Qur’án has imprisoned therein." (The sub-narrator, Qatada used to say at that point, "... those upon whom eternity (in Hell) has been imposed.") (See Ḥadít_h No. 3, Vol 6).

Narrated by 'Imran bin Ḥusayn {#8:571 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Some people will be taken out of the Fire through the intercession of Muḥammad they will enter Paradise and will be called Al-Jahannamiyin (the Hell Fire people)."

Narrated by Anas {#8:572 .italic}

Um (the mother of) Haritha came to Alláh's Apostle after Haritha had been martyred on the Day (of the battle) of Badr by an arrow thrown by an unknown person. She said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You know the position of Haritha in my heart (i.e. how dear to me he was), so if he is in Paradise, I will not weep for him, or otherwise, you will see what I will do." The Prophet said, "Are you mad? Is there only one Paradise? There are many Paradises, and he is in the highest Paradise of Firdaus." The Prophet added, "A forenoon journey or an after noon journey in Alláh's Cause is better than the whole world and whatever is in it; and a place equal to an arrow bow of anyone of you, or a place equal to a foot in Paradise is better than the whole world and whatever is in it; and if one of the women of Paradise looked at the earth, she would fill the whole space between them (the earth and the heaven) with light, and would fill whatever is in between them, with perfume, and the veil of her face is better than the whole world and whatever is in it."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:573 .italic}

The Prophet said, "None will enter Paradise but will be shown the place he would have occupied in the (Hell) Fire if he had rejected faith, so that he may be more thankful; and none will enter the (Hell) Fire but will be shown the place he would have occupied in Paradise if he had faith, so that may be a cause of sorrow for him."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:574 .italic}

I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who will be the luckiest person who will gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?" The Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! I have thought that none will ask me about this Ḥadít_h before you, as I know your longing for the (learning of) Hádíths. The luckiest person who will have my intercession on the Day of Resurrection will be the one who said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh,' sincerely from the bottom of his heart."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#8:575 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I know the person who will be the last to come out of the (Hell) Fire, and the last to enter Paradise. He will be a man who will come out of the (Hell) Fire crawling, and Alláh will say to him, 'Go and enter Paradise.' He will go to it, but he will imagine that it had been filled, and then he will return and say, 'O Lord, I have found it full.' Alláh will say, 'Go and enter Paradise, and you will have what equals the world and ten times as much (or, you will have as much as ten times the like of the world).' On that, the man will say, 'Do you mock at me (or laugh at me) though You are the King?" I saw Alláh's Apostle (while saying that) smiling that his premolar teeth became visible. It is said that will be the lowest in degree amongst the people of Paradise.

Narrated by ‘Abbás {#8:576 .italic}

That he said to the Prophet "Did you benefit Abu Talib with anything?"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:577 .italic}

Some people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" He said, "Do you crowd and squeeze each other on looking at the sun when it is not hidden by clouds?" They replied, "No, Alláh's Apostle." He said, "Do you crowd and squeeze each other on looking at the moon when it is full and not hidden by clouds?" They replied, No, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "So you will see Him (your Lord) on the Day of Resurrection similarly Alláh will gather all the people and say, 'Whoever used to worship anything should follow that thing. 'So, he who used to worship the sun, will follow it, and he who used to worship the moon will follow it, and he who used to worship false deities will follow them; and then only this nation (i.e., Muslims) will remain, including their hypocrites. Alláh will come to them in a shape other than they know and will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'We seek refuge with Alláh from you. This is our place; (we will not follow you) till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us, we will recognize Him. Then Alláh will come to then in a shape they know and will say, "I am your Lord.' They will say, '(No doubt) You are our Lord,' and they will follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid over the (Hell) Fire." Alláh's Apostle added, "I will be the first to cross it. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day, will be 'Allahukka Sallim, Sallim (O Alláh, save us, save us!),' and over that bridge there will be hooks Similar to the thorns of As Sa'dan (a thorny tree). Didn't you see the thorns of As-Sa'dan?" The companions said, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle." He added, "So the hooks over that bridge will be like the thorns of As-Sa-dan except that their greatness in size is only known to Alláh. These hooks will snatch the people according to their deeds. Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some will be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved afterwards, when Alláh has finished the judgments among His slaves, and intends to take out of the Fire whoever He wishes to take out from among those who used to testify that none had the right to be worshipped but Alláh. We will order the angels to take them out and the angels will know them by the mark of the traces of prostration (on their foreheads) for Alláh banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the body of Adam's son. So they will take them out, and by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then water, called Maul Hayat (water of life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed springs out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain one man who will be facing the (Hell) Fire and will say, 'O Lord! It's (Hell's) vapor has Poisoned and smoked me and its flame has burnt me; please turn my face away from the Fire.' He will keep on invoking Alláh till Alláh says, 'Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you will ask for another thing?' The man will say, 'No, by Your Power, I will not ask You for anything else.' Then Alláh will turn his face away from the Fire. The man will say after that, 'O Lord, bring me near the gate of Paradise.' Alláh will say (to him), 'Didn't you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' The man will keep on invoking Alláh till Alláh will say, 'But if I give you that, you may ask me for something else.' The man will say, 'No, by Your Power. I will not ask for anything else.' He will give Alláh his covenant and promise not to ask for anything else after that. So Alláh will bring him near to the gate of Paradise, and when he sees what is in it, he will remain silent as long as Alláh will, and then he will say, 'O Lord! Let me enter Paradise.' Alláh will say, 'Didn't you promise that you would not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to you, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' On that, the man will say, 'O Lord! Do not make me the most wretched of Your creation,' and will keep on invoking Alláh till Alláh will smile and when Alláh will smile because of him, then He will allow him to enter Paradise, and when he will enter Paradise, he will be addressed, 'Wish from so-and-so.' He will wish till all his wishes will be fulfilled, then Alláh will say, All this (i.e. what you have wished for) and as much again therewith are for you.' " Abu Huraira added: That man will be the last of the people of Paradise to enter (Paradise). Narrated 'Ata (while Abu Huraira was narrating): Abu Said was sitting in the company of Abu Huraira and he did not deny anything of his narration till he reached his saying: "All this and as much again therewith are for you." Then Abu Sa‘íd said, "I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'This is for you and ten times as much.' " Abu Huraira said, "In my memory it is 'as much again therewith.' "

It will be said, 'You do not know what they did after you had left.'

The word 'Al-Kauthar' means the abundant good which Alláh gave to him (the Prophet Muḥammad). Abu Bishr said: I said to Said, "Some people claim that it (Al-Kauthar) is a river in Paradise." Said replied, "The river which is in Paradise is one item of that good which Alláh has bestowed upon him (Muḥammad)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#8:581 .italic}

Its water is whiter than milk, and its smell is nicer than musk (a kind of Perfume), and its drinking cups are (as numerous) as the (number of) stars of the sky; and whoever drinks from it, will never be thirsty."

He said, 'That is the Kauthar which Your Lord has given to you.' Behold! Its scent or its mud was sharp smelling musk!" (The sub-narrator, Hudba is in doubt as to the correct expression.)

Narrated by Anas {#8:584 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Some of my companions will come to me at my Lake Fount, and after I recognize them, they will then be taken away from me, whereupon I will say, 'My companions!' Then it will be said, 'You do not know what they innovated (new things) in the religion after you."

There will come to me some people whom I will recognize, and they will recognize me, but a barrier will be placed between me and them." Abu Hazim added: An-Nu'man bin Abi 'Aiyash, on hearing me, said. "Did you hear this from Sahl?" I said, "Yes." He said, " I bear witness that I heard Abu Said Al-Khudri saying the same, adding that the Prophet said: 'I will say: They are of me (i.e. my followers). It will be said, 'You do not know what they innovated (new things) in the religion after you left'. I will say, 'Far removed, far removed (from mercy), those who changed (their religion) after me." Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said, "On the Day of Resurrection a group of companions will come to me, but will be driven away from the Lake-Fount, and I will say, 'O Lord (those are) my companions!' It will be said, 'You have no knowledge as to what they innovated after you left; they turned apostate as renegades (reverted from Islam)."

## Volume 8, Book 77

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#8:593 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said, "Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a similar period (of forty days) and then Alláh sends an angel and orders him to write four things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Alláh, a person among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, but then that writing (which Alláh has ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is only a cubit or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does the deeds of the people of the Fire and enters it."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#8:594 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Alláh puts an angel in charge of the uterus and the angel says, 'O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.' And then, if Alláh wishes to complete its creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?' So all that is written while the creature is still in the mother's womb."

Narrated by Imran bin Ḥusayn {#8:595 .italic}

A man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Can the people of Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied, "Yes." The man said, "Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?" The Prophet said, "Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do." (i.e. everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created).

The Prophet ; was asked about the offspring of the pagans. He said, "Alláh knows what they would have done (were they to live)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:597 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle was asked about the offspring of the pagans. He said, "Alláh knows what they would have done (were they to live)." Narrated Abu Huraira: Alláh's Apostle said, "No child is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one before you mutilate them yourself?" The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What do you think about those (of them) who die young?" The Prophet said, "Alláh knows what they would have done (were they to live)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:598 .italic}

Once while I was with the Prophet and Sa'd, Ubai bin Ka'b and Mu'adh were also sitting with him, there came to him a messenger from one of his daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death. The Prophet told the messenger to tell her, "It is for Alláh what He takes, and it is for Alláh what He gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for Alláh's reward."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:600 .italic}

That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the Ansar came and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We get slave girls from the war captives and we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?" Alláh's Apostle said, "Do you do that? It is better for you not to do it, for there is no soul which Alláh has ordained to come into existence but will be created."

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#8:601 .italic}

The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of us stored that our minds and some forgot it. (After that speech) I used to see events taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but I had forgotten them (before their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizes another man who has been absent and then sees and recognizes him.

Narrated by ‘Alí {#8:602 .italic}

While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, "There is none of you but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise." Thereupon a man from the people said, "Shall we not depend upon this, O Alláh's Apostle?" The Prophet said, "No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such deeds (as will lead him to his place)." The Prophet then recited the Verse: 'As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Alláh...' (92.5)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:603 .italic}

We witnessed along with Alláh's Apostle the Khaibar (campaign). Alláh's Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, "This man is from the people of the Fire." When the battle started, the man fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Do you know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very bravely for Alláh's Cause and he has received many wounds." The Prophet said, "But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire." Some of the Muslims were about to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Alláh has made your statement true. So-and-so has committed suicide." Alláh's Apostle said, "O Bilal! Get up and announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Alláh may support this religion (Islam) with a wicked man."

Narrated by Sahl bin Sa'd {#8:604 .italic}

There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet looked at him and said. "If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the Fire, let him look at this (brave man)." On that, a man from the People (Muslims) followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, "I testify that you are Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet asked him, "Why do you say that?" He said, "You said about so-and-so, 'If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the Fire, he should look at him.' He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he hastened to die and committed suicide." There-upon the Prophet said, "A man may do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise, and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions (deeds)".

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#8:605 .italic}

The Prophet forbade vowing and said, "In fact, vowing does not prevent anything, but it makes a miser to spend his property."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:606 .italic}

The Prophet said (that Alláh said), "Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate, but vowing is imposed on him by way of fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his wealth."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#8:607 .italic}

While we were with Alláh's Apostle in a holy battle, we never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with Takbir. Alláh's Apostle came close to us and said, "O people! Don't exert yourselves, for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the All-Seer." The Prophet then said, "O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais! Shall I teach you a sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): 'La haula wala quwata illa billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Alláh)."

Narrated by Abu Said Al-Khudri {#8:608 .italic}

That the Prophet said, "No Caliph is appointed but has two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it; and the protected is the one whom Alláh protects."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:609 .italic}

I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, "Alláh has written for the son of Adam his inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery) and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the temptation."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:610 .italic}

(regarding the Verse) "And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens "Miraj") which We showed you (O Muḥammad as an actual eye witness) but as a trial for mankind.' (17.60): Alláh's Apostle actually saw with his own eyes the vision (all the things which were shown to him) on the night of his Night Journey to Jerusalem (and then to the heavens).

The Prophet said, "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said to Adam. 'O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us out of Paradise.' Then Adam said to him, 'O Moses! Alláh favored you with His talk (talked to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for action which Alláh had written in my fate forty years before my creation?' So Adam confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses," the Prophet added, repeating the Statement three times.

No-one can withhold what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the fortune of a man of means is useless before You (i.e., only good deeds are of value)."

The pagans have rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse (to flee)." (See Ḥadít_h No. 430, Vol. 5).

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:618 .italic}

Abu Bakr As-Siddiq had never broken his oaths till Alláh revealed the expiation for the oaths. Then he said, "If I take an oath to do something and later on I find something else better than the first one, then I do what is better and make expiation for my oath."

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samura {#8:619 .italic}

The Prophet said, "O 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, because if you are given authority for it, then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped in it (by Alláh): and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your oath."

Narrated by Abu Musa {#8:620 .italic}

I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash'ariyin in order to request him to provide us with mounts. He said, "By Alláh, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven't got anything to mount you on." Then we stayed there as long as Alláh wished us to stay, and then three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, "By Alláh, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath)." When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, "I did not give you mounts, but it is Alláh Who gave you. By Alláh, Alláh willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:621 .italic}

The Prophet said, "We (Muslims) are the last in the world, but will be foremost on the Day of Resurrection."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:622 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Anyone who takes an oath through which his family may be harmed, and insists on keeping it, he surely commits a sin greater (than that of dissolving his oath). He should rather compensate for that oath by making expiation."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#8:623 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle sent an army detachment and made Usama bin Zaid its commander. Some people criticized (spoke badly of) Usama's leadership. So Alláh's Apostle got up saying, "If you people are criticizing Usama's leadership, you have already criticized the leadership of his father before. But Wa-aimullah (i.e., By Alláh), he (i.e. Zaid) deserved the leadership, and he was one of the most beloved persons to me; and now this (his son Usama) is one of the dearest persons to me after him."

He said, "My son was a laborer serving this (person) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, The people said that my son is to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one-hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the learned people, who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will be exiled for one year, and stoning will be the lot for the man's wife." Alláh's Apostle said, "Indeed, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge between you according to Alláh's Laws: As for your sheep and slave girl, they are to be returned to you." Then he scourged his son one hundred lashes and exiled him for one year. Then Unais Al-Aslami was ordered to go to the wife of the second man, and if she confessed (the crime), then stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death.

Alláh's Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee returned after completing his job and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This (amount of Zakat) is for you, and this (other amount) was given to me as a present." The Prophet said to him, "Why didn't you stay at your father's or mother's house and see if you would be given presents or not?" Then Alláh's Apostle got up in the evening after the prayer, and having testified that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and praised and glorified Alláh as He deserved, he said, "Now then ! What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, 'This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me as a present'? Why didn't he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hand Muḥammad's soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding." The Prophet added, "I have preached you (Alláh's Message)." Abu Humaid said, "Then Alláh's Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits."

I could not remain quiet, and Alláh knows in what sorrowful state I was at that time. So I said, ' Who are they (the losers)? Let My father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "They are the wealthy people, except the one who does like this and like this and like this (i.e., spends of his wealth in Alláh's Cause)."

Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a half-man.

Abu Musa invited him to the meal. He said, "I have seen chickens eating dirty things, so I deemed it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken." On that, Abu Musa said, "Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group of the Ash'ariyin and I went to Alláh's Apostle and asked him to provide us with mounts; he said, 'By Alláh, I will never give you any mounts nor do I have anything to mount you on.' Then a few camels of war booty were brought to Alláh's Apostle , and he asked about us, saying, 'Where are the Ash-'ariyin?' He then ordered five nice camels to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, 'What have we done? Alláh's Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we might ride? Did we take advantage of the fact that Alláh's Apostle had forgotten his oath? By Alláh, we will never succeed.' So we went back to him and said to him, 'We came to you to give us mounts, and you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had nothing to mount us on.' On that he said, 'I did not provide you with mounts, but Alláh did.

Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib that once he had a guest, so he told his family (on the Day of Id-ul-Adha) that they should slaughter the animal for sacrifice before he returned from the ('Id) prayer in order that their guest could take his meal. So his family slaughtered (the animal ) before the prayer. Then they mentioned that event to the Prophet who ordered Al-Bara to slaughter another sacrifice. Al-Bara' said to the Prophet , "I have a young milch she-goat which is better than two sheep for slaughtering." (The sub-narrator, Ibn 'Aun used to say, "I don't know whether the permission (to slaughter a she-goat as a sacrifice) was especially given to Al-Bara' or if it was in general for all the Muslims.")

After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Alláh's Apostle and he said, "Where are those Ash'ariyin? Where are those Ash'ariyin?" So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, 'We went to Alláh's Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Alláh's Apostle forgot his oath. By Alláh, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Alláh's Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Alláh's Apostle to remind him of his oath.' We returned and said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.' The Prophet said, 'Depart, for Alláh has given you Mounts.

And by that Alláh's Apostle meant himself.' The group said, '(No doubt), he said so.' ‘Umar then faced ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, 'Do you both know that Alláh's Apostle said that?' They replied, '(No doubt), he said so.' ‘Umar said, 'So let me talk to you about this matter. Alláh favored His Apostle with something of this Fai' (i.e. booty won by the Muslims at war without fighting) which He did not give to anybody else; Alláh said: 'And what Alláh gave to His Apostle ( Fai' Booty) ... to do all things...(59.6) And so that property was only for Alláh's Apostle . Yet, by Alláh, he neither gathered that property for himself nor withheld it from you, but he gave its income to you, and distributed it among you till there remained the present property out of which the Prophet used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Alláh's property is spent (i.e. in charity etc.). Alláh's Apostle followed that throughout his life. Now I beseech you by Alláh, do you know all that?' They said, 'Yes.' ‘Umar then said to ‘Alí and ‘Abbás, 'I beseech you by Alláh, do you know that?' Both of them said, 'Yes.' ‘Umar added, 'And when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr said, ' I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle, and took charge of that property and managed it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle did. Then I took charge of this property for two years during which I managed it as Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr did. Then you both (‘Alí and ‘Abbás) came to talk to me, bearing the same claim and presenting the same case. (O ‘Abbás!) You came to me asking for your share from the property of your nephew, and this man (‘Alí) came to me, asking for the share of h is wife from the property of her father. I said, 'If you both wish, I will give that to you on that condition (i.e. that you would follow the way of the Prophet and Abu Bakr and as I (‘Umar) have done in man aging it).' Now both of you seek of me a verdict other than that? Lo! By Alláh, by Whose permission both the heaven and the earth exist, I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established. If you are unable to manage it, then return it to me, and I will be sufficient to manage it on your behalf.' "

I was stricken by an ailment that led me to the verge of death. The Prophet came to pay me a visit. I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have much property and no heir except my single daughter. Shall I give two-thirds of my property in charity?" He said, "No." I said, "Half of it?" He said, "No." I said, "One-third of it?" He said, "You may do so) though one-third is also to a much, for it is better for you to leave your off-spring wealthy than to leave them poor, asking others for help. And whatever you spend (for Alláh's sake) you will be rewarded for it, even for a morsel of food which you may put in the mouth of your wife." I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Will I remain behind and fail to complete my emigration?" The Prophet said, "If you are left behind after me, whatever good deeds you will do for Alláh's sake, that will upgrade you and raise you high. May be you will have long life so that some people may benefit by you and others (the enemies) be harmed by you." But Alláh's Apostle felt sorry for Sa'd bin Khaula as he died in Mecca. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that Sa'd bin Khaula was a man from the tribe of Bani 'Amir bin Lu'ai.)

Mu'adh bin Jabal came to us in Yemen as a tutor and a ruler, and we (the people of Yemen) asked him about (the distribution of the property of ) a man who had died leaving a daughter and a sister. Mu'adh gave the daughter one-half of the property and gave the sister the other half.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:727 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Give the Fara'id (shares prescribed in the Qur’án) to those who are entitled to receive it; and whatever remains, should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased.'

Narrated by Huzail bin Shirahbil {#8:728 .italic}

Abu Musa was asked regarding (the inheritance of) a daughter, a son's daughter, and a sister. He said, "The daughter will take one-half and the sister will take one-half. If you go to Ibn Mas'ud, he will tell you the same." Ibn Mas'ud was asked and was told of Abu Musa's verdict. Ibn Mas'ud then said, "If I give the same verdict, I would stray and would not be of the rightly-guided. The verdict I will give in this case, will be the same as the Prophet did, i.e. one-half is for daughter, and one-sixth for the son's daughter, i.e. both shares make two-thirds of the total property; and the rest is for the sister." Afterwards we cams to Abu Musa and informed him of Ibn Mas'ud's verdict, whereupon he said, "So, do not ask me for verdicts, as long as this learned man is among you."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:729 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Give the Fara'id, (the shares prescribed in the Qur’án) to those who are entitled to receive it, and then whatever remains, should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:730 .italic}

The person about whom Alláh's Apostle said, "If I were to take a Khalil from this nation (my followers), then I would have taken him (i.e., Abu Bakr), but the Islamic Brotherhood is better (or said: good)," regarded a grandfather as the father himself (in inheritance).

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:731 .italic}

(During the early days of Islam), the inheritance used to be given to one's offspring and legacy used to be bequeathed to the parents, then Alláh cancelled what He wished from that order and decreed that the male should be given the equivalent of the portion of two females, and for the parents one-sixth for each of them, and for one's wife one-eighth (if the deceased has children) and one-fourth (if he has no children), for one's husband one-half (if the deceased has no children) and one-fourth (if she has children)."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:732 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle gave the judgment that a male or female slave should be given in Qisas for an abortion case of a woman from the tribe of Bani Lihyan (as blood money for the fetus) but the lady on whom the penalty had been imposed died, so the Prophets ordered that her property be inherited by her offspring and her husband and that the penalty be paid by her Asaba.

Narrated by Al-Aswad {#8:733 .italic}

Mu'adh bin Jabal gave this verdict for us in the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle. One-half of the inheritance is to be given to the daughter and the other half to the sister. Sulaiman said: Mu'adh gave a verdict for us, but he did not mention that it was so in the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle.

Narrated by Huzail {#8:734 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh said, "The judgment I will give in this matter will be like the judgment of the Prophet, i.e. one-half is for the daughter and one-sixth for the son's daughter and the rest of the inheritance for the sister."

Narrated by Jabir {#8:735 .italic}

While I was sick, the Prophet entered upon me and asked for some water to perform ablution, and after he had finished his ablution, he sprinkled some water of his ablution over me, whereupon I became conscious and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have sisters." Then the Divine Verses regarding the laws of inheritance were revealed.

Narrated by Al-Bara {#8:736 .italic}

The last Qur’ánic Verse that was revealed (to the Prophet) was the final Verse of Surat-an-Nisa, i.e., 'They ask you for a legal verdict Say: Alláh directs (thus) About those who leave No descendants or ascendants as heirs...' (4.176)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:737 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "I am more closer to the believers than their ownselves, so whoever (among them) dies leaving some inheritance, his inheritance will be given to his 'Asaba, and whoever dies leaving a debt or dependants or destitute children, then I am their supporter."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:738 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Give the Fara'id (the shares of the inheritance that are prescribed in the Qur’án) to those who are entitled to receive it; and whatever is left should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:739 .italic}

Regarding the Holy Verse: 'And to everyone, We have appointed heirs. When the emigrants came to Medina, the Ansar used to be the heir of the emigrants (and vice versa) instead of their own kindred by blood (Dhawl-l-arham), and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had established between them, i.e. the Ansar and the emigrants. But when the Divine Verse: 'And to everyone We have appointed heirs,' (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled the other, order i.e. 'To those also, to whom Your right hands have pledged.'

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#8:740 .italic}

A man and his wife had a case of Lian (or Mula'ana) during the lifetime of the Prophet and the man denied the paternity of her child. The Prophet gave his verdict for their separation (divorce) and then the child was regarded as belonging to the wife only.

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:741 .italic}

'Utba (bin Abi Waqqas) said to his brother Sa'd, "The son of the slave girl of Zam'a is my son, so be his custodian." So when it was the year of the Conquest of Mecca, Sa'd took that child and said, "He is my nephew, and my brother told me to be his custodian." On that, 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, 'but the child is my brother, and the son of my father's slave girl as he was born on his bed." So they both went to the Prophet. Sa'd said, "O Alláh's Apostle! (This is) the son of my brother and he told me to be his custodian." Then 'Abu bin Zam'a said, "(But he is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, born on his bed." The Prophet said, "This child is for you. O 'Abu bin Zam'a, as the child is for the owner of the bed, and the adulterer receives the stones." He then ordered (his wife) Sauda bint Zam'a to cover herself before that boy as he noticed the boy's resemblance to 'Utba. Since then the boy had never seen Sauda till he died.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:742 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The boy is for the owner of the bed."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#8:743 .italic}

I bought Barira (a female slave). The Prophet said (to me), "Buy her as the Wala' is for the manumitted." Once she was given a sheep (in charity). The Prophet said, "It (the sheep) is a charitable gift for her (Barira) and a gift for us." Al-Hakam said, "Barira's husband was a free man." Ibn ‘Abbás said, 'When I saw him, he was a slave."

'Aisha bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her masters stipulated that her Wala' (after her death) would be for them. 'Aisha said, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have bought Barira in order to manumit her, but her masters stipulated that her Wala' will be for them." The Prophet said, "Manumit her as the Wala is for the one who manumits (the slave)," or said, "The one who pays her price." Then 'Aisha bought and manumitted her. After that, Barira was given the choice (by the Prophet) (to stay with her husband or leave him). She said, "If he gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay with him." (Al-Aswad added: Her husband was a free man.) The sub-narrator added: The series of the narrators of Al-Aswad's statement is incomplete. The statement of Ibn ‘Abbás, i.e., when I saw him he was a slave, is more authentic.

Narrated by ‘Alí {#8:747 .italic}

We have no Book to recite except the Book of Alláh (Qur’án) and this paper. Then ‘Alí took out the paper, and behold ! There was written in it, legal verdicts about the retaliation for wounds, the ages of the camels (to be paid as Zakat or as blood money). In it was also written: 'Medina is a sanctuary from Air (mountain) to Thaur (mountain). So whoever innovates in it an heresy (something new in religion) or commits a crime in it or gives shelter to such an innovator, will incur the curse of Alláh, the angels and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever (a freed slave) takes as his master (i.e. be-friends) some people other than hi real masters without the permission of his real masters, will incur the curse of Alláh, the angels and all the people, and none of his compulsory, or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection. And the asylum granted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the Muslims, even if it is granted by one of the lowest social status among them; and whoever betrays a Muslim, in this respect will incur the curse of Alláh, the angels, and all the people, and none of his Compulsory or optional good deeds will be accepted on the Day of Resurrection."

That Aisha, the mother of the Believers, intended to buy a slave girl in order to manumit her. The slave girl's master said, "We are ready to sell her to you on the condition that her Wala should be for us." Aisha mentioned that to Alláh's Apostle who said, "This (condition) should not prevent you from buying her, for the Wala is for the one who manumits (the slave)."

Narrated by Al-Aswad {#8:750 .italic}

Aisha said, "I bought Barira and her masters stipulated that the Wala would be for them." Aisha mentioned that to the Prophet and he said, "Manumit her, as the Wala is for the one who gives the silver (i.e. pays the price for freeing the slave)." Aisha added, "So I manumitted her. After that, the Prophet caller her (Barira) and gave her the choice to go back to her husband or not. She said, "If he gave me so much and so much (money) I would not stay with him."

And 'Abu bin Zam'a said, "This is my brother, O Alláh's Apostle! He was born on my father's bed by his slave girl." Then the Prophet looked at the boy and noticed evident resemblance between him and 'Utba, so he said, "He (the toy) is for you, O 'Abu bin Zam'a, for the boy is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the adulterer.

Then both of them went to (the Prophet) Solomon, son of David and informed him of the case. Solomon said, 'Give me a knife so that I may cut the child into two portions and give one half to each of you.' The younger lady said, 'Do not do so; may Alláh bless you ! He is her child.'

Then he got up and addressed the people, saying, "O people! The nations before you went astray because if a noble person committed theft, they used to leave him, but if a weak person among them committed theft, they used to inflict the legal punishment on him.

(They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Alláh, a man who remembers Alláh in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in the mosque), two men who love each other for Alláh's Sake, a man who is called by a charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says, 'I am afraid of Alláh,' and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given."

I will narrate to you a narration which nobody will narrate to you after me. I heard that form the Prophet. I heard the Prophet saying, "The Hour sill not be established" or said: "From among the portents of the Hour is that the religious knowledge will betaken away (by the death of religious Scholars) and general ignorance (of religion) will appear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very common, and (open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decrease in number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty women there will only be one man to look after them."

Alláh's Apostles said, "When a slave (of Alláh) commits illegal sexual intercourse, he is not a believer at the time of committing it; and if he steals, he is not a believer at the time of stealing; and if he drinks an alcoholic drink, when he is not a believer at the time of drinking it; and he is not a believer when he commits a murder," 'Ikrima said: I asked Ibn ‘Abbás, "How is faith taken away from him?" He said, Like this," by clasping his hands and then separating them, and added, "But if he repents, faith returns to him like this, by clasping his hands again.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:801 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The one who commits an illegal sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse and a thief is not a believer at the time of committing theft and a drinker of alcoholic drink is not a believer at the time of drinking. Yet, (the gate of) repentance is open thereafter."

They replied, "Our priests have innovated the punishment of blackening the faces with charcoal and Tajbiya." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said, "O Alláh's Apostle, tell them to bring the Torah." The Torah was brought, and then one of the Jews put his hand over the Divine Verse of the Rajam (stoning to death) and started reading what preceded and what followed it. On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, "Lift up your hand." Behold! The Divine Verse of the Rajam was under his hand.

While we were with the Prophet , a man stood up and said (to the Prophet ), "I beseech you by Alláh, that you should judge us according to Alláh's Laws." Then the man's opponent who was wiser than him, got up saying (to Alláh's Apostle) "Judge us according to Alláh's Law and kindly allow me (to speak)." The Prophet said, "'Speak." He said, "My son was a laborer working for this man and he committed an illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom for my son's sin. Then I asked a learned man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and be exiled for one year, and the man's wife should be stoned to death." The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of Alláh. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais! Go to the wife of this man, and if she confesses, then stone her to death." Unais went to her and she confessed. He then stoned her to death.

‘Umar said, "I am afraid that after a long time has passed, people may say, "We do not find the Verses of the Rajam (stoning to death) in the Holy Book," and consequently they may go astray by leaving an obligation that Alláh has revealed. Lo! I confirm that the penalty of Rajam be inflicted on him who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if he is already married and the crime is proved by witnesses or pregnancy or confession." Sufyan added, "I have memorized this narration in this way." ‘Umar added, "Surely Alláh's Apostle carried out the penalty of Rajam, and so did we after him."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:817 .italic}

I used to teach (the Qur’án to) some people of the Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf. While I was in his house at Mina, and he was with ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab during ‘Umar's last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman came to me and said, "Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of the Believers (‘Umar), saying, 'O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about so-and-so who says, 'If ‘Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person, as by Alláh, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.' ‘Umar became angry and then said, 'Alláh willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership)." 'Abdur-Rahman said, "I said, 'O Chief of the believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble, and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning, and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the place of emigration and the place of Prophet's Traditions, and there you can come in touch with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.' On that, ‘Umar said, 'By Alláh! Alláh willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver before the people in Medina." Ibn ‘Abbás added: We reached Medina by the end of the month of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun had declined, and I saw Sa‘íd bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a short while ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to Said bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail "Today ‘Umar will say such a thing as he has never said since he was chosen as Caliph." Said denied my statement with astonishment and said, "What thing do you expect ‘Umar to say the like of which he has never said before?" In the meantime, ‘Umar sat on the pulpit and when the callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, ‘Umar stood up, and having glorified and praised Alláh as He deserved, he said, "Now then, I am going to tell you something which (Alláh) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Alláh sent Muḥammad with the Truth and revealed the Holy Book to him, and among what Alláh revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the stoning of married person (male & female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Alláh's Apostle did carry out the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody will say, 'By Alláh, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Alláh's Book,' and thus they will go astray by leaving an obligation which Alláh has revealed. And the punishment of the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male & female), who commits illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Alláh's Book: 'O people! Do not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real father.' Then Alláh's Apostle said, 'Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry was praised, but call me Alláh's Slave and His Apostles.' (O people!) I have been informed that a speaker amongst you says, 'By Alláh, if ‘Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to such-and-such person.' One should not deceive oneself by saying that the pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt, it was like that, but Alláh saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both should be killed. And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa'da. ‘Alí and Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr. I said to Abu Bakr, 'Let's go to these Ansari brothers of ours.' So we set out seeking them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the final decision of the Ansar, and said, 'O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you going?' We replied, 'We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.' They said to us, 'You shouldn't go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.' I said, 'By Alláh, we will go to them.' And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa'da. Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, 'Who is that man?' They said, 'He is Sa'd bin 'Ubada.' I asked, 'What is wrong with him?' They said, 'He is sick.' After we sat for a while, the Ansar's speaker said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh,' and praising Alláh as He deserved, he added, 'To proceed, we are Alláh's Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you, the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.' When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr, and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, 'Wait a while.' I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser and more patient than I. By Alláh, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause he said, 'O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves, but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr held my hand and Abu Ubada bin ‘Abdu’lláh's hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing of what he had said except that proposal, for by Alláh, I would rather have my neck chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don't feel at present.' And then one of the Ansar said, 'I am the pillar on which the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us and one from you.' Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, 'O Abu Bakr! Hold your hand out.' He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we became victorious over Sa'd bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the Ansar said, 'You have killed Sa'd bin Ubada.' I replied, 'Alláh has killed Sa'd bin Ubada.' ‘Umar added, "By Alláh, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph) without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted allegiance, lest both of them should be killed."

A bedouin came to the Prophet while he (the Prophet) was sitting, and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Give your verdict according to Alláh's Laws (in our case)." Then his opponent got up and said, "He has told the truth, O Alláh's Apostle! Decide his case according to Alláh's Laws. My son was a laborer working for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year." The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Alláh's Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais! Go to the wife of this man (and if she confesses), stone her to death." So Unais went in the morning and stoned her to death (after she had confessed).

Narrated by Abu Huraira and Said bin Khalid {#8:822 .italic}

The verdict of Alláh's Apostle was sought about an unmarried slave girl guilty of illegal intercourse. He replied, "If she commits illegal sexual intercourse, then flog her (fifty stripes), and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse (after that for the second time), then flog her (fifty stripes), and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse (for the third time), then flog her (fifty stripes) and sell her for even a hair rope." Ibn Shihab said, "I am not sure whether the Prophet ordered that she be sold after the third or fourth time of committing illegal intercourse."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:823 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If a lady slave commits illegal sexual intercourse and she is proved guilty of illegal sexual intercourse, then she should be flogged (fifty stripes) but she should not be admonished; and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse again, then she should be flogged again but should not be admonished; and if she commits illegal sexual intercourse for the third time, then she should be sold even for a hair rope."

Narrated by Ash-Shaibani {#8:824 .italic}

I asked ‘Abdu’lláh bin Abi 'Aufa about the Rajam (stoning somebody to death for committing illegal sexual intercourse). He replied, "The Prophet carried out the penalty of Rajam," I asked, "Was that before or after the revelation of Surat-an-Núr?" He replied, "I do not know."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#8:825 .italic}

The jews came to Alláh's Apostle and mentioned to him that a man and a lady among them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Alláh's Apostle said to them, "What do you find in the Torah regarding the Rajam?" They replied, "We only disgrace and flog them with stripes." ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said to them, 'You have told a lie the penalty of Rajam is in the Torah.' They brought the Torah and opened it. One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before and after it. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Salam said to him, "Lift up your hand." Where he lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, "O Muḥammad! He has said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah)." Then Alláh's Apostle ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death, and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her from the stones.

Narrated by Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid {#8:826 .italic}

Two men had a dispute in the presence of Alláh's Apostle. One of them said, "Judge us according to Alláh's Laws." The other who was more wise said, "Yes, Alláh's Apostle, judge us according to Alláh's Laws and allow me to speak (first)" The Prophet said to him, 'Speak " He said, "My son was a laborer for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I have given one-hundred sheep and a slave girl as a ransom (expiation) for my son's sin. Then I asked the religious learned people (about It), and they told me that my son should he flogged one-hundred stripes and should be exiled for one year, and only the wife of this man should be stoned to death " Alláh's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Alláh's Laws: O man, as for your sheep and slave girl, they are to be returned to you." Then the Prophet had the man's son flogged one hundred stripes and exiled for one year, and ordered Unais Al-Aslami to go to the wife of the other man, and if she confessed, stone her to death. She confessed and was stoned to death.

Abu Bakr came to me while Alláh's Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh. Abu Bakr said (to me), "You have detained Alláh's Apostle and the people, and there is no water in this place."

Narrated by Aisha {#8:828 .italic}

I witnessed the case of Lian (the case of a man who charged his wife for committing illegal sexual intercourse when I was fifteen years old. The Prophet ordered that they be divorced, and the husband said, "If I kept her, I would be a liar." I remember that Az-Zubair also said, "(It was said) that if that woman brought forth the child with such-and-such description, her husband would prove truthful, but if she brought it with such-and-such description looking like a Wahra (a red insect), he would prove untruthful." I heard Az-Zubair also saying, "Finally she gave birth to a child of description which her husband disliked.

Narrated by Al-Qasim bin Muḥammad {#8:838 .italic}

Ibn ‘Abbás mentioned the couple who had taken the oath of Lian. ‘Abdu’lláh bin Shaddad said (to him), "Was this woman about whom Alláh's Apostle said, 'If I were ever to stone to death any woman without witnesses. (I would have stoned that woman to death)?' Ibn ‘Abbás replied," No, that lady exposed herself (by her suspicious behavior)."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#8:839 .italic}

Lian was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet, Asim bin Adi said a statement about it, and when he left, a man from his tribe came to him complaining that he had seen a man with his wife. Asim said, "I have been put to trial only because of my statement." So he took the man to the Prophet and the man told him about the incident. The man (husband) was of yellow complexion, thin, and of lank hair, while the man whom he had accused of having been with his wife, was reddish brown with fat thick legs and fat body. The Prophet said, "O Alláh! Reveal the truth." Later on the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom the husband had accused of having been with her. So the Prophet made them take the oath of Lian. A man said to Ibn ‘Abbás in the gathering, "Was that the same lady about whom the Prophet said, "If I were to stone any lady (for committing illegal sexual intercourse) to death without witnesses, I would have stoned that lade to death?" Ibn ‘Abbás said, "No, that was another lady who used to behave in such a suspicious way among the Muslims that one might accuse her of committing illegal sexual intercourse."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#8:840 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Avoid the seven great destructive sins." They (the people!) asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What are they?" He said, "To join partners in worship with Alláh; to practice sorcery; to kill the life which Alláh has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law); to eat up usury (Riba), to eat up the property of an orphan; to give one's back to the enemy and freeing from the battle-field at the time of fighting and to accuse chaste women who never even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers."

A man came to the Prophet and said, "I beseech you to judge us according to Alláh's Laws." Then his opponent who was wiser than he, got up and said, "He has spoken the truth. So judge us according to Alláh's Laws and please allow me (to speak), O Alláh's Apostle." The Prophet said, "Speak." He said, "My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they informed me that my son should be flogged one-hundred stripes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death)."The Prophet said, "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Alláh's Laws. The one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais! Go in the morning to the wife of this man and ask her, and if she confesses, stone her to death." She confessed and he stoned her to death.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:1 .italic}

A man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Which sin is the greatest in Alláh's Sight?" The Prophet said, "To set up a rival unto Alláh though He Alone created you. " The man said, "What is next?" The Prophet said, "To kill your son lest he should share your food with you." The man said, "What is next?" The Prophet said, "To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor." So Alláh revealed in confirmation of this narration: 'And those who invoke not with Alláh, any other god. Nor kill, such life as Alláh has forbidden except for just cause nor commit illegal sexual intercourse. And whoever does this shall receive the punishment.' (25.68)

Alláh's Apostle said, "Do not kill him." Al-Miqdad said, "But O Alláh's Apostle! He had chopped off one of my hands and he said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?" The Prophet said. "Do not kill him for if you kill him, he would be in the position in which you had been before you kill him, and you would be in the position in which he was before he said the sentence." The Prophet also said to Al-Miqdad, "If a faithful believer conceals his faith (Islam) from the disbelievers, and then when he declares his Islam, you kill him, (you will be sinful). Remember that you were also concealing your faith (Islam) at Mecca before."

The Ansari refrained from killing him but I stabbed him with my spear till I killed him. When we reached (Medina), this news reached the Prophet. He said to me, "O Usama! You killed him after he had said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh?"' I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! He said so in order to save himself." The Prophet said, "You killed him after he had said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh." The Prophet kept on repeating that statement till I wished I had not been a Muslim before that day.

She raised her head, denying that. He said for the third time, "Did so-and-so strike you?" She lowered her head, agreeing. Alláh's Apostle then sent for the killer and killed him between two stones.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:17 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:19 .italic}

In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza'a killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith in revenge for a killed person belonging to them in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Alláh's Apostle got up saying, "Alláh held back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let His Apostle and the believers overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily! Fighting in Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody after me; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is at this moment a sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not be cut down; and its Luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who would look for its owner. And if somebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to choose one of two things, i.e., either the Blood money or retaliation by having the killer killed." Then a man from Yemen, called Abu S_háh, stood up and said, "Write that) for me, O Alláh's Apostle!" Alláh's Apostle said (to his companions), "Write that for Abu S_háh." Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, "O Alláh's Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for graves." Alláh's Apostle said, "Except Al-idhkkir."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:20 .italic}

For the children of Israel the punishment for crime was Al-Qisas only (i.e., the law of equality in punishment) and the payment of Blood money was not permitted as an alternate. But Alláh said to this nation (Muslims): 'O you who believe! Qisas is prescribed for you in case of murder, ... (up to)... end of the Verse. (2.178) Ibn ‘Abbás added: Remission (forgiveness) in this Verse, means to accept the Blood-money in an intentional murder. Ibn ‘Abbás added: The Verse: 'Then the relatives should demand Blood-money in a reasonable manner.' (2.178) means that the demand should be reasonable and it is to be compensated with handsome gratitude.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:21 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The most hated persons to Alláh are three: (1) A person who deviates from the right conduct, i.e., an evil doer, in the Haram (sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina); (2) a person who seeks that the traditions of the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, should remain in Islam (3) and a person who seeks to shed somebody's blood without any right."

He shouted (to his companions), "O Alláh's worshipers, my father, my father!" But by Alláh, they did not stop till they killed him (i.e., Hudhaifa's father). Hudhaifa said, "May Alláh forgive you." ('Urwa said, Hudhaifa continued asking Alláh's Forgiveness for the killer of his father till he died.

Narrated by Salama {#9:29 .italic}

We went out with the Prophet to Khaibar. A man (from the companions) said, "O 'Amir! Let us hear some of your Huda (camel-driving songs.)"

The Prophet said, "May Alláh bestow His Mercy on him !" The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer!" Then 'Amir was killed the following morning. The people said, "The good deeds of 'Amir are lost as he has killed himself." I returned at the time while they were talking about that. I went to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Prophet! Let my father be sacrificed for you! The people claim that 'Amir's good deeds are lost." The Prophet said, "Whoever says so is a liar, for 'Amir will have a double reward as he exerted himself to obey Alláh and fought in Alláh's Cause. No other way of killing would have granted him greater reward."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#9:35 .italic}

We poured medicine into the mouth of Alláh's Apostle during his illness, and he pointed out to us intending to say, "Don't pour medicine into my mouth." We thought that his refusal was out of the aversion a patient usually has for medicine. When he improved and felt a bit better he said (to us.) "Didn't I forbid you to pour medicine into my mouth?" We said, "We thought (you did so) because of the aversion, one usually have for medicine." Alláh's Apostle said, "There is none of you but will be forced to drink medicine, and I will watch you, except Al-‘Abbás, for he did not witness this act of yours."

Narrated by Sahl bin Abi Hathma {#9:36 .italic}

(a man from the Ansar) That a number of people from his tribe went to Khaibar and dispersed, and then they found one of them murdered. They said to the people with whom the corpse had been found, "You have killed our companion!" Those people said, "Neither have we killed him, nor do we know his killer." The bereaved group went to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! We went to Khaibar and found one of us murdered." The Prophet said, "Let the older among you come forward and speak." Then the Prophet said, to them, "Bring your proof against the killer." They said "We have no proof." The Prophet said, "Then they (the defendants) will take an oath." They said, "We do not accept the oaths of the Jews." Alláh's Apostle did not like that the Blood-money of the killed one be lost without compensation, so he paid one-hundred camels out of the camels of Zakat (to the relatives of the deceased) as Diya (Blood-money).

Narrated by Abu Qilaba {#9:37 .italic}

Once ‘Umar bin ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz sat on his throne in the courtyard of his house so that the people might gather before him. Then he admitted them and (when they came in), he said, "What do you think of Al-Qasama?" They said, "We say that it is lawful to depend on Al-Qasama in Qisas, as the previous Muslim Caliphs carried out Qisas depending on it." Then he said to me, "O Abu Qilaba! What do you say about it?" He let me appear before the people and I said, "O Chief of the Believers! You have the chiefs of the army staff and the nobles of the Arabs. If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?" He said, "No." I said, "If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?" He replied, "No." I said, "By Alláh, Alláh's Apostle never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man who fought against Alláh and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate." Then the people said, "Didn't Anas bin Malik narrate that Alláh's Apostle cut off the hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?" I said, "I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: "Eight persons from the tribe of 'Ukl came to Alláh's Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and complained about that to Alláh's Apostle. He said (to them ), "Won't you go out with the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels' milk and urine (as medicine)?" They said, "Yes." So they went out and drank the camels' milk and urine, and after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Alláh's Apostle and took away all the camels. This news reached Alláh's Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them in the sun till they died." I said, "What can be worse than what those people did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft." Then 'Anbasa bin Said said, "By Alláh, I never heard a narration like this of today." I said, "O 'Anbasa! You deny my narration?" 'Anbasa said, "No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be related. By Alláh, these people are in welfare as long as this S_hayk_h (Abu Qilaba) is among them." I added, "Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by Alláh's Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to Alláh's Apostle and said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle, we have found our companion who had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed)." Alláh's Apostle went out and asked them, "Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed him?" They said, "We think that the Jews have killed him." The Prophet sent for the Jews and asked them, "Did you kill this (person)?" They replied, "No." He asked the Al-Ansars, "Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an oath that they have not killed him?" They said, "It matters little for the Jews to kill us all and then take false oaths." He said, "Then would you like to receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your man)?" They said, "We will not take the oath." Then the Prophet himself paid them the Diya (Blood-money)." The narrator added, "The tribe of Hudhail repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance. Then, at a place called Al-Batha' (near Mecca), the man attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured the Yemenite and brought him to ‘Umar during the Hajj season and said, "He has killed our companion." The Yemenite said, "But these people had repudiated him (i.e., their companion)." ‘Umar said, "Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had not repudiated him." So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, "We and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year and then died." I further said, "‘Abdu’l- Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in Sham."

A man peeped through a hole in the door of Alláh's Apostle's house, and at that time, Alláh's Apostle had a Midri (an iron comb or bar) with which he was rubbing his head. So when Alláh's Apostle saw him, he said (to him), "If I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your eye with this (sharp iron bar)." Alláh's Apostle added, "The asking for permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there is in the house without the permission of its people)."

I asked, 'What is written in this paper?' He replied, 'Al-‘Aql (the regulation of Diya), about the ransom of captives, and the Judgment that a Muslim should not be killed in Qisas (equality in punishment) for killing a disbeliever." (See Ḥadít_h No. 283,Vol. 4)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:45 .italic}

Two women from Hudhail fought with each other and one of them hit the other with a stone that killed her and what was in her womb. The relatives of the killer and the relatives of the victim submitted their case to the Prophet who judged that the Diya for the fetus was a male or female slave, and the Diya for the killed woman was to be paid by the 'Asaba (near relatives) of the killer.

A Jew whose face had been slapped (by someone), came to the Prophet and said, "O Muḥammad! A man from your Ansari companions slapped me. " The Prophet said, "Call him". They called him and the Prophet asked him, "Why did you slap his face?" He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! While I was passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, 'By Him Who chose Moses above all the human beings.' I said (protestingly), 'Even above Muḥammad?' So I became furious and slapped him." The Prophet said, "Do not give me preference to other prophets, for the people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain conscious, and behold, I will Find Moses holding one of the pillars of the Throne (of Alláh). Then I will not know whether he has become conscious before me or he has been exempted because of his unconsciousness at the mountain (during his worldly life) which he received."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:53 .italic}

When the Verse: 'It is those who believe and confuse not their belief with wrong (i.e., worshipping others besides Alláh): (6.82) was revealed, it became very hard on the companions of the Prophet and they said, "Who among us has not confused his belief with wrong (oppression)?" On that, Alláh's Apostle said, "This is not meant (by the Verse). Don't you listen to Luqman's statement: 'Verily! Joining others in worship with Alláh is a great wrong indeed.' (31.13)

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#9:54 .italic}

The Prophet. said, "The biggest of the great sins are: To join others in worship with Alláh, to be undutiful to one's parents, and to give a false witness." He repeated it thrice, or said, "... a false statement," and kept on repeating that warning till we wished he would stop saying it. (See Ḥadít_h No.7, Vol. 8)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr {#9:55 .italic}

A bedouin came to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What are the biggest sins?: The Prophet said, "To join others in worship with Alláh." The bedouin said, "What is next?" The Prophet said, "To be undutiful to one's parents." The bedouin said "What is next?" The Prophet said "To take an oath 'Al-Ghamus." The bedouin said, "What is an oath 'Al-Ghamus'?" The Prophet said, "The false oath through which one deprives a Muslim of his property (unjustly)."

Narrated by Ibn Mas'ud {#9:56 .italic}

A man said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we be punished for what we did in the Prelslamic Period of ignorance?" The Prophet said, "Whoever does good in Islam will not be punished for what he did in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and whoever does evil in Islam will be punished for his former and later (bad deeds)."

Narrated by 'Ikrima {#9:57 .italic}

Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to ‘Alí and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn ‘Abbás who said, "If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Alláh's Apostle forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Alláh's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Alláh's Apostle, 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'"

Abu Musa said, "I came to the Prophet along with two men (from the tribe) of Ash'ariyin, one on my right and the other on my left, while Alláh's Apostle was brushing his teeth (with a Siwak), and both men asked him for some employment. The Prophet said, 'O Abu Musa (O ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais!).' I said, 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.' As if I were looking now at his Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, 'We never (or, we do not) appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or ‘Abdu’lláh bin Qais!) Go to Yemen.'" The Prophet then sent Mu'adh bin Jabal after him and when Mu'adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu'adh asked, "Who is this (man)?" Abu Muisa said, "He was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism." Then Abu Muisa requested Mu'adh to sit down but Mu'adh said, "I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Alláh and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, "Then we discussed the night prayers and one of us said, 'I pray and sleep, and I hope that Alláh will reward me for my sleep as well as for my prayers.'"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:59 .italic}

When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, ‘Umar said, "O Abu Bakr! How can you fight these people although Alláh's Apostle said, 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, 'and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh', Alláh will save his property and his life from me, unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account will be with Alláh?' "Abu Bakr said, "By Alláh! I will fight whoever differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Alláh's Orders). By Alláh! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Alláh's Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it." ‘Umar said, "By Alláh: It was nothing, but I noticed that Alláh opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#9:60 .italic}

A Jew passed by Alláh's Apostle and said, "As-Samu 'Alaika." Alláh's Apostle said in reply, "We 'Alaika." Alláh's Apostle then said to his companions, "Do you know what he (the Jew) has said? He said, 'As-Samu 'Alaika.'" They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we kill him?" The Prophet, said, "No. When the people of the Book greet you, say: 'Wa 'Alaikum.'"

Narrated by 'Aisha {#9:61 .italic}

A group of Jews asked permission to visit the Prophet (and when they were admitted) they said, "As-Samu 'Alaika (Death be upon you)." I said (to them), "But death and the curse of Alláh be upon you!" The Prophet said, "O 'Aisha! Alláh is kind and lenient and likes that one should be kind and lenient in all matters." I said, "Haven't you heard what they said?"

Narrated by ‘Alí {#9:64 .italic}

Whenever I tell you a narration from Alláh's Apostle, by Alláh, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Ḥadít_h) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection."

That they visited Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri and asked him about Al-Harauriyya, a special unorthodox religious sect, "Did you hear the Prophet saying anything about them?" Abu Sa‘íd said, "I do not know what Al-Harauriyya is, but I heard the Prophet saying, "There will appear in this nation... he did not say: From this nation... a group of people so pious apparently that you will consider your prayers inferior to their prayers, but they will recite the Qur’án, the teachings of which will not go beyond their throats and will go out of their religion as an arrow darts through the game, whereupon the archer may look at his arrow, its Nasl at its Risaf and its Fuqa to see whether it is blood-stained or not (i.e. they will have not even a trace of Islam in them)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#9:66 .italic}

Regarding Al-Harauriyya: The Prophet said, "They will go out of Islam as an arrow darts out of the game's body.'

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd {#9:67 .italic}

While the Prophet was distributing (something, ‘Abdu’lláh bin Dhil Khawaisira At-Tamimi came and said, "Be just, O Alláh's Apostle!" The Prophet said, "Woe to you ! Who would be just if I were not?" ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "Allow me to cut off his neck ! " The Prophet said, "Leave him, for he has companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and your fasting with theirs, you will look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison to theirs. Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game's body in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined, nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared by dung and blood. The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (or breast) will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will appear when there will be differences among the people (Muslims)." Abu Sa‘íd added: I testify that I heard this from the Prophet and also testify that ‘Alí killed those people while I was with him. The man with the description given by the Prophet was brought to ‘Alí. The following Verses were revealed in connection with that very person (i.e., ‘Abdu’lláh bin Dhil-Khawaisira At-Tarnimi): 'And among them are men who accuse you (O Muḥammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.' (9.58)

"

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established till two (huge) groups fight against each other, their claim being one and the same."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:70 .italic}

When the Verse: 'Those who believe and did not confuse their belief with wrong (worshipping others besides Alláh).' (6.82) was revealed, it was hard on the companions of the Prophet and they said, "Who among us has not wronged (oppressed) himself?" Alláh's Apostle said, "The meaning of the Verse is not as you think, but it is as Luqman said to his son, 'O my son! Join not in worship others with Alláh, Verily! Joining others in worship with Alláh is a great wrong indeed.'" (31.13)

Narrated by 'Itban bin Malik {#9:71 .italic}

Once Alláh's Apostle came to me in the morning, and a man among us said, "Where is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?" Another man from us replied, "He is a hypocrite who does not love Alláh and His Apostle." The Prophet said, "Don't you think that he says: None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, only for Alláh's sake?" They replied, "Yes" The Prophet said, "Nobody will meet Alláh with that saying on the Day of Resurrection, but Alláh will save him from the Fire."

Abu 'Abdur-Rahman and Hibban bin 'Atiyya had a dispute. Abu 'Abdur-Rahman said to Hibban, "You know what made your companions (i.e. ‘Alí) dare to shed blood." Hibban said, "Come on! What is that?" 'Abdur-Rahman said, "Something I heard him saying." The other said, "What was it?" 'AbdurRahman said, "‘Alí said, Alláh's Apostle sent for me, Az-Zubair and Abu Marthad, and all of us were cavalry men, and said, 'Proceed to Raudat-Hajj (Abu Salama said that Abu 'Awana called it like this, i.e., Hajj where there is a woman carrying a letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta'a to the pagans (of Mecca). So bring that letter to me.' So we proceeded riding on our horses till we overtook her at the same place of which Alláh's Apostle had told us. She was traveling on her camel. In that letter Hatib had written to the Meccans about the proposed attached of Alláh's Apostle against them. We asked her, "Where is the letter which is with you?' She replied, 'I haven't got any letter.' So we made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage, but we did not find anything. My two companions said, 'We do not think that she has got a letter.' I said, 'We know that Alláh's Apostle has not told a lie.'" Then ‘Alí took an oath saying, "By Him by Whom one should swear! You shall either bring out the letter or we shall strip off your clothes." She then stretched out her hand for her girdle (round her waist) and brought out the paper (letter). They took the letter to Alláh's Apostle. ‘Umar said, "O Alláh's Apostle! (Hatib) has betrayed Alláh, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop off his neck!" Alláh's Apostle said, "O Hatib! What obliged you to do what you have done?" Hatib replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! Why (for what reason) should I not believe in Alláh and His Apostle? But I intended to do the (Mecca) people a favor by virtue of which my family and property may be protected as there is none of your companions but has some of his people (relatives) whom Alláh urges to protect his family and property." The Prophet said, "He has said the truth; therefore, do not say anything to him except good." ‘Umar again said, "O Alláh's Apostle! He has betrayed Alláh, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop his neck off!" The Prophet said, "Isn't he from those who fought the battle of Badr? And what do you know, Alláh might have looked at them (Badr warriors) and said (to them), 'Do what you like, for I have granted you Paradise?' " On that, ‘Umar's eyes became flooded with tears and he said, "Alláh and His Apostle know best."

He said, "Among those who were before you a (believer) used to be seized and, a pit used to be dug for him and then he used to be placed in it. Then a saw used to be brought and put on his head which would be split into two halves. His flesh might be combed with iron combs and removed from his bones, yet, all that did not cause him to revert from his religion. By Alláh! This religion (Islam) will be completed (and triumph) till a rider (traveler) goes from San'a' (the capital of Yemen) to Hadramout fearing nobody except Alláh and the wolf lest it should trouble his sheep, but you are impatient." (See Ḥadít_h No. 191, Vol. 5)

So we went along with him till we reached Bait-al-Midras (a place where the Torah used to be recited and all the Jews of the town used to gather). The Prophet stood up and addressed them, "O Assembly of Jews! Embrace Islam and you will be safe!" The Jews replied, "O Aba-l-Qasim! You have conveyed Alláh's message to us." The Prophet said, "That is what I want (from you)." He repeated his first statement for the second time, and they said, "You have conveyed Alláh's message, O Aba-l-Qasim." Then he said it for the third time and added, "You should Know that the earth belongs to Alláh and His Apostle, and I want to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever among you owns some property, can sell it, otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Alláh and His Apostle."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:81 .italic}

Regarding the Qur’ánic Verse: 'O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will.' ( 4.19) The custom (in the Pre-lslamic Period) was that if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and if one of them wished, he could marry her, or they could marry her to somebody else, or prevent her from marrying if they wished, for they had more right to dispose of her than her own relatives. Therefore this Verse was revealed concerning this matter.

The bedouin said, "Tell me what Alláh has enjoined on me as regard Zakat." The Prophet then told him the Islamic laws and regulations whereupon the bedouin said, "By Him Who has honored you, I will not perform any optional deeds of worship and I will not leave anything of what Alláh has enjoined on me." Alláh's Apostle said, "He will be successful if he has told the truth (or he will enter Paradise if he said the truth)." And some people said, "The Zakat for one-hundred and twenty camels is two Hiqqas, and if the Zakat payer slaughters the camels intentionally or gives them as a present or plays some other trick in order to avoid the Zakat, then there is no harm (in it) for him.

The Prophet added, "By Alláh, that snake will keep on following him until he stretches out his hand and let the snake swallow it." Alláh's Apostle added, "If the owner of camels does not pay their Zakat, then, on the Day of Resurrection those camels will come to him and will strike his face with their hooves." Some people said: Concerning a man who has camels, and is afraid that Zakat will be due so he sells those camels for similar camels or for sheep or cows or money one day before Zakat becomes due in order to avoid payment of their Zakat cunningly!

Alláh's Apostle used to like sweets and also used to like honey, and whenever he finished the 'Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives and stay with them. Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her longer than the period he used to stay, so I enquired about it. It was said to me, "A woman from her tribe gave her a leather skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Alláh's Apostle to drink." I said, "By Alláh, we will play a trick on him." So I mentioned the story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) and said to her, "When he enters upon you, he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He will say, 'No.' Then you say to him, 'What is this bad smell? ' And it would be very hard on Alláh's Apostle that a bad smell should be found on his body. He will say, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' Then you should say to him, 'Its bees must have sucked from the Al-'Urfut (a foul smelling flower).' I too, will tell him the same. And you, O Saifya, say the same." So when the Prophet entered upon Sauda (the following happened). Sauda said, "By Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I was about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at the gate because of fear from you. But when Alláh 's Apostle came near to me, I said to him, 'O Alláh's Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?' He replied, 'No.' I said, 'What about this smell?' He said, 'Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.' I said, 'Its bees must have sucked Al-'Urfut.' " When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he entered upon Safiya, she too told him the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall I give you a drink of it (honey)?" He said, "I have no desire for it." Sauda said, Subhan Alláh! We have deprived him of it (honey)." I said to her, "Be quiet!"

‘Umar bin Al-Khattab left for Sham, and when he reached a placed called Sargh, he came to know that there was an outbreak of an epidemic (of plague) in Sham. Then 'AbdurRahman bin 'Auf told him that Alláh's Apostle said, "If you hear the news of an outbreak of an epidemic (plague) in a certain place, do not enter that place: and if the epidemic falls in a place while you are present in it, do not leave that place to escape from the epidemic." So ‘Umar returned from Sargh.

That he heard Usama bin Zaid speaking to Sa'd, saying, "Alláh's Apostle mentioned the plague and said, 'It is a means of punishment with which some nations were punished and some of it has remained, and it appears now and then. So whoever hears that there is an outbreak of plague in some land, he should not go to that land, and if the plague breaks out in the land where one is already present, one should not run away from that land, escaping from the plague."

The Prophet said, "The one who takes back his gift is like a dog swallowing its own vomit, and we (believers) should not act according to this bad example."

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:106 .italic}

The Prophet has decreed that preemption is valid in all cases where the real estate concerned has not been divided, but if the boundaries are established and the ways are made, then there is no preemption. A man said, "Preemption is only for the neighbor," and then he makes invalid what he has confirmed. He said, "If someone wants to buy a house and being afraid that the neighbor (of the house) may buy it through preemption, he buys one share out of one hundred shares of the house and then buys the rest of the house, then the neighbor can only have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest of the house; and the buyer may play such a trick in this case."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Ash-Sharid {#9:107 .italic}

Al-Miswar bin Makhrama came and put his hand on my shoulder and I accompanied him to Sa'd. Abu Rafi' said to Al-Miswar, "Won't you order this (i.e. Sa'd) to buy my house which is in my yard?" Sa'd said, "I will not offer more than four hundred in installments over a fixed period." Abu Rafi said, "I was offered five hundred cash but I refused. Had I not heard the Prophet saying, 'A neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,' I would not have sold it to you." The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma'mar did not say so. Sufyan said, "But he did say so to me." Some people said, "If someone wants to sell a house and deprived somebody of the right of preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render the preemption invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the seller one-thousand Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption." Narrated 'Amr bin Ash-Sharid: Abu Rafi' said that Sa'd offered him four hundred Mit_hqál of gold for a house. Abu Rafi ' said, "If I had not heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'A neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor,' then I would not have given it to you." Some people said, "If one has bought a portion of a house and wants to cancel the right of preemption, he may give it as a present to his little son and he will not be obliged to take an oath."

Narrated by Abu Humaid As-Sa‘ídi {#9:108 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to collect the Zakat from Bani Sulaim's tribe. When he returned, the Prophet called him to account. He said (to the Prophet, 'This is your money, and this has been given to me as a gift." On that, Alláh's Apostle said, "Why didn't you stay in your father's and mother's house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the truth?" Then the Prophet addressed us, and after praising and glorifying Alláh, he said: "Amma Ba'du", I employ a man from among you to manage some affair of what Alláh has put under my custody, and then he comes to me and says, 'This is your money and this has been given to me as a gift. Why didn't he stay in his father's and mother's home to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Alláh, not anyone of you takes a thing unlawfully but he will meet Alláh on the Day of Resurrection, carrying that thing. I do not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep on meeting Alláh." Then the Prophet raised both his hands till the whiteness of his armpits became visible, and he said, "O Alláh! Haven't I have conveyed (Your Message)?" The narrator added: My eyes witnessed and my ears heard (that Ḥadít_h).

Narrated by Abu Rafi' {#9:109 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else)." Some men said, "If one wants to buy a house for 20,000 Dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to deprive somebody of preemption by buying it (just on paper) with 20,000 Dirhams but paying to the seller only 9,999 Dirhams in cash and then agree with the seller to pay only one Dinar in cash for the rest of the price (i.e. 10,001 Dirhams). If the preemptor offers 20,000 Dirhams for the house, he can buy it otherwise he has no right to buy it (by this trick he got out of preemption). If the house proves to belong to somebody else other than the seller, the buyer should take back from the seller what he has paid, i.e., 9,999 Dirhams and one Dinar, because if the house proves to belong to somebody else, so the whole bargain (deal) is unlawful. If the buyer finds a defect in the house and it does not belong to somebody other than the seller, the buyer may return it and receive 20,000 Dirhams (instead of 9999 Dirham plus one Dinar) which he actually paid.' Abu ‘Abdu’lláh said, "So that man allows (some people) the playing of tricks amongst the Muslims (although) the Prophet said, 'In dealing with Muslims one should not sell them sick (animals) or bad things or stolen things."

Narrated by 'Amr bin Ash-Sharid {#9:110 .italic}

Abu Rafi' sold a house to Sa'd bin Malik for four-hundred Mit_hqál of gold, and said, "If I had not heard the Prophet saying, 'The neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else),' then I would not have sold it to you."

## Volume 9, Book 87

Narrated by 'Aisha {#9:111 .italic}

The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Alláh's Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Alláh Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, "I do not know how to read." (The Prophet added), "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, "I do not know how to read," whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I replied, "I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?)." Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, "Read: In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most Generous... up to... that which he knew not." (96.15) Then Alláh's Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, "Cover me! Cover me!" They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, "O Khadija, what is wrong with me?" Then he told her everything that had happened and said, 'I fear that something may happen to me." Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by Alláh, Alláh will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones." Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin ‘Abdu’l-'Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Alláh wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, "O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew." Waraqa asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" The Prophet described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, "This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Alláh had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Alláh's Apostle asked, "Will they turn me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: "Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, "O Muḥammad! You are indeed Alláh's Apostle in truth" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn ‘Abbás said regarding the meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)' (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night).

(The narrator Ishaq is not sure as to which expression was correct). Um Haram added, 'I said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Invoke Alláh, to make me one of them;" So Alláh's Apostle invoked Alláh for her and then laid his head down (and slept). Then he woke up smiling (again).

On hearing that, ‘Umar started weeping and said, " Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. O Alláh's Apostle! How dare I think of my Ghira being offended by you?

Narrated by Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:151 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said: (I saw in a dream that) I entered Paradise, and behold, there was a palace built of gold! I asked, 'For whom is this palace?' They (the angels) replied, 'For a man from the Quraish.' " The Prophet added, "O Ibn Al-Khattab! Nothing stopped me from entering it except your Ghira." ‘Umar said, "How dare I think of my Ghira being offended by you, O Alláh's Apostle?"

Alláh's Apostle said, "While I was sleeping, I saw myself performing the Tawaf of the Ka'ba. Behold, there I saw a whitish-red lank-haired man (holding himself) between two men with water dropping from his hair. I asked, 'Who is this?' The people replied, 'He is the son of Mary.' Then I turned my face to see another man with red complexion, big body, curly hair, and blind in the right eye which looked like a protruding out grape. I asked, 'Who is he?' They replied, 'He is Ad-Dajjal.' Ibn Qatan resembles him more than anybody else among the people and Ibn Qatan was a man from Bani Al-Mustaliq from Khuza'a."

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "While I was sleeping, I saw a bowl full of milk was brought to me and I drank of it (to my fill) till I noticed its wetness flowing (in my body). Then I gave the remaining of it to ‘Umar." They asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! What have you interpreted (about the dream)? He said, "(It is Religious) knowledge." (See Ḥadít_h No. 134)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#9:155 .italic}

Men from the companions of Alláh's Apostle used to see dreams during the lifetime of Alláh's Apostle and they used to narrate those dreams to Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle would interpret them as Alláh wished. I was a young man and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, "If there were any good in myself, I too would see what these people see." So when I went to bed one night, I said, "O Alláh! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream." So while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was between them, invoking Alláh, "O Alláh! I seek refuge with You from Hell." Then I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said to me, "Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more often." So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels) took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to Alláh's Apostle. Alláh's Apostle said, "No doubt, ‘Abdu’lláh is a good man." (Nafi' said, "Since then ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar used to pray much.)

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#9:156 .italic}

I was a young unmarried man during the lifetime of the Prophet. I used to sleep in the mosque. Anyone who had a dream, would narrate it to the Prophet. I said, "O Alláh! If there is any good for me with You, then show me a dream so that Alláh's Apostle may interpret it for me." So I slept and saw (in a dream) two angels came to me and took me along with them, and they met another angel who said to me, "Don't be afraid, you are a good man." They took me towards the Fire, and behold, it was built inside like a well, and therein I saw people some of whom I recognized, and then the angels took me to the right side. In the morning, I mentioned that dream to Hafsa. Hafsa told me that she had mentioned it to the Prophet and he said, "‘Abdu’lláh is a righteous man if he only prays more at night." (Az-Zuhri said, "After that, ‘Abdu’lláh used to pray more at night.")

Alláh's Apostle said, "While I was sleeping, two golden bangles were put in my two hands, so I got scared (frightened) and disliked it, but I was given permission to blow them off, and they flew away. I interpret it as a symbol of two liars who will appear." 'Ubaidullah said, "One of them was Al-'Ansi who was killed by Fairuz at Yemen and the other was Musailama (at Najd).

Narrated by Abu Musa {#9:159 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I saw in a dream that I was migrating from Mecca to a land where there were date palm trees. I thought that it might be the land of Al-Yamama or Hajar, but behold, it turned out to be Yathrib (i.e. Medina). And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Alláh is better (than worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed) on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good and the reward and the truth which Alláh bestowed upon us after the Badr battle. (or the Battle of Uhud) and that was the victory bestowed by Alláh in the Battle of Khaibar and the conquest of Mecca).

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:160 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "We (Muslims) are the last (to come) but (will be) the foremost (on the Day of Resurrection)." Alláh's Apostle further said, ''While sleeping, I was given the treasures of the world and two golden bangles were put in my hands, but I felt much annoyed, and those two bangles distressed me very much, but I was inspired that I should blow them off, so I blew them and they flew away. Then I interpreted that those two bangles were the liars between whom I was (i.e., the one of San'a' and the one of Yamama)."

The Prophet said, "Whoever claims to have seen a dream which he did not see, will be ordered to make a knot between two barley grains which he will not be able to do; and if somebody listens to the talk of some people who do not like him (to listen) or they run away from him, then molten lead will be poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection; and whoever makes a picture, will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and will be ordered to put a soul in that picture, which he will not be able to do."

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#9:169 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "If anyone of you saw a dream which he liked, then that was from Alláh, and he should thank Alláh for it and tell it to others; but if he saw something else, i.e, a dream which he did not like, then that is from Satan and he should seek refuge with Alláh from it and should not tell it to anybody for it will not harm him."

## Volume 9, Book 88

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:170 .italic}

A man came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "I saw in a dream, a cloud having shade. Butter and honey were dropping from it and I saw the people gathering it in their hands, some gathering much and some a little. And behold, there was a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you (the Prophet) held it and went up, and then another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third) held it and went up, and then after another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got connected again." Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you! Allow me to interpret this dream." The Prophet said to him, "Interpret it." Abu Bakr said, "The cloud with shade symbolizes Islam, and the butter and honey dropping from it, symbolizes the Qur’án, its sweetness dropping and some people learning much of the Qur’án and some a little. The rope which is extended from the sky to the earth is the Truth which you (the Prophet) are following. You follow it and Alláh will raise you high with it, and then another man will follow it and will rise up with it and another person will follow it and then another man will follow it but it will break and then it will be connected for him and he will rise up with it. O Alláh's Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you! Am I right or wrong?" The Prophet replied, "You are right in some of it and wrong in some." Abu Bakr said, "O Alláh's Prophet! By Alláh, you must tell me in what I was wrong." The Prophet said, "Do not swear."

Narrated by Samura bin Jundub {#9:171 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle very often used to ask his companions, "Did anyone of you see a dream?" So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Alláh wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, "Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, 'Proceed!' I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Alláh! Who are these two persons?' They said, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Alláh! Who are these two persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread)." I think the Prophet said, "In that oven t here was much noise and voices." The Prophet added, "We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' And so we proceeded and came across a river." I think he said, "... red like blood." The Prophet added, "And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, 'Who are these (two) persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, 'Go up and I went up' The Prophet added, "So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape." The Prophet further added, "My two companions (angels) said to me, 'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, 'That (palace) is your place.' I said to them, 'May Alláh bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied, 'As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to them, 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' They replied, 'We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur’án and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith)." The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, "O Alláh's Apostle! What about the children of pagans?" The Prophet replied, "And also the children of pagans." The Prophet added, "My two companions added, 'The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Alláh forgave them.'"

The Prophet said, "I will be at my Lake-Fount (Kauthar) waiting for whoever will come to me. Then some people will be taken away from me whereupon I will say, 'My followers!' It will be said, 'You do not know they turned Apostates as renegades (deserted their religion).'" (Ibn Abi Mulaika said, "Alláh, we seek refuge with You from turning on our heels from the (Islamic) religion and from being put to trial").

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:173 .italic}

The Prophet said, "I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar) and some men amongst you will be brought to me, and when I will try to hand them some water, they will be pulled away from me by force whereupon I will say, 'O Lord, my companions!' Then the Almighty will say, 'You do not know what they did after you left, they introduced new things into the religion after you.'"

There will come to me some people whom I know and they know me, and then a barrier will be set up between me and them." Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri added that the Prophet further said: "I will say those people are from me. It will be said, 'You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.' Then I will say, 'Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me!"

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:175 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said to us, "You will see after me, selfishness (on the part of other people) and other matters that you will disapprove of."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:176 .italic}

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:177 .italic}

He replied, "(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others." I asked, "Will there be any evil after that good?" He replied, "Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire." I said, "O Alláh s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?" He said, "They will be from our own people and will speak our language." I said, "What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?" He said, "Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler)." I said, "If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?" He said, "Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state."

Narrated by Abu Al-Aswad {#9:207 .italic}

An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them. Then I met 'Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, "Ibn ‘Abbás told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their number against Alláh's Apostle (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one of them and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Alláh revealed: 'Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers).' (4.97)

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#9:208 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men's hearts (from Alláh) and then they learned it from the Qur’án and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet's traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: "Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one's foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, 'in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,' and later it will be said about some man, 'What a wise, polite and strong man he is!' Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart." No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.

Narrated by Salama bin Al-Akwa {#9:209 .italic}

That he visited Al-Hajjaj (bin Yusuf). Al-Hajjaj said, "O son of Al-Akwa! You have turned on your heels (i.e., deserted Islam) by staying (in the desert) with the bedouins." Salama replied, "No, but Alláh's Apostle allowed me to stay with the bedouin in the desert." Narrated Yazíd bin Abi Ubaid: When 'Uthman bin Affan was killed (martyred), Salama bin Al-Akwa' went out to a place called Ar-Rabadha and married there and begot children, and he stayed there till a few nights before his death when he came to Medina.

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#9:210 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "There will come a time when the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he will take to the tops of mountains and the places of rainfall so as to flee with his religion from the afflictions.

Narrated by Anas {#9:211 .italic}

The people started asking the Prophet too many questions importunately. So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, "You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you." I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Who is my father?" The Prophet replied, "Your father is Hudhaifa." Then ‘Umar got up and said, "We accept Alláh as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muḥammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Alláh from the evil of afflictions." The Prophet said, " I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall," Qatada said: This Ḥadít_h used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse: 'O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.' (5.101)

Narrated by Salim's father {#9:212 .italic}

The Prophet stood up beside the pulpit (and pointed with his finger towards the East) and said, "Afflictions are there! Afflictions are there, from where the side of the head of Satan comes out," or said, "...the side of the sun..."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#9:213 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle while he was facing the East, saying, "Verily! Afflictions are there, from where the side of the head of Satan comes out."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#9:214 .italic}

The Prophet said, "O Alláh! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham! O Alláh! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen." The People said, "And also on our Najd." He said, "O Alláh! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham (north)! O Alláh! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen." The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! And also on our Najd." I think the third time the Prophet said, "There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan."

Narrated by Sa‘íd bin Jubair {#9:215 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Ḥadít_h. But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, "O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Alláh says: 'And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Alláh).'" (2.193) Ibn ‘Umar said (to the man), "Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muḥammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling."

Narrated by Shaqiq {#9:216 .italic}

I heard Hudhaifa saying, "While we were sitting with ‘Umar, he said, 'Who among you remembers the statement of the Prophet about the afflictions?' Hudhaifa said, "The affliction of a man in his family, his property, his children and his neighbors are expiated by his prayers, Zakat (and alms) and enjoining good and forbidding evil." ‘Umar said, "I do not ask you about these afflictions, but about those afflictions which will move like the waves of the sea." Hudhaifa said, "Don't worry about it, O chief of the believers, for there is a closed door between you and them." ‘Umar said, "Will that door be broken or opened?" I said, "No. it will be broken." ‘Umar said, "Then it will never be closed," I said, "Yes." We asked Hudhaifa, "Did ‘Umar know what that door meant?" He replied, "Yes, as I know that there will be night before tomorrow morning, that is because I narrated to him a true narration free from errors." We dared not ask Hudhaifa as to whom the door represented so we ordered Masruq to ask him what does the door stand for? He replied, "‘Umar."

Narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari {#9:217 .italic}

The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, "To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me." The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), "Wait till I get you permission." Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, "O Alláh's Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter." He said, "Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise." So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then ‘Umar came and I said (to him), "Wait till I get you permission." The Prophet said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise." So ‘Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then 'Uthman came and I said (to him), "Wait till I get permission for you." The Prophet said, "Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him." When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Alláh for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, "I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of 'Uthman is separate from theirs.")

Narrated by Abu Wail {#9:218 .italic}

Someone said to Usama, "Will you not talk to this (Uthman)?" Usama said, "I talked to him (secretly) without being the first man to open an evil door. I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn't you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?' That man will say, 'I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.' "

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#9:219 .italic}

During the battle of Al-Jamál, Alláh benefited me with a Word (I heard from the Prophet). When the Prophet heard the news that the people of the Persia had made the daughter of Khosrau their Queen (ruler), he said, "Never will succeed such a nation as makes a woman their ruler."

Narrated by Abu Maryam ‘Abdu’lláh bin Ziyad Al-Aasadi {#9:220 .italic}

When Talha, AzZubair and 'Aisha moved to Basra, ‘Alí sent 'Ammar bin Yasir and Ḥasan bin ‘Alí who came to us at Kufa and ascended the pulpit. Al-Ḥasan bin ‘Alí was at the top of the pulpit and 'Ammar was below Al-Ḥasan. We all gathered before him. I heard 'Ammar saying, "'Aisha has moved to Al-Busra. By Alláh! She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter. But Alláh has put you to test whether you obey Him (Alláh) or her ('Aisha)."

Narrated by Abu Wail {#9:221 .italic}

'Ammar stood on the pulpit at Kufa and mentioned 'Aisha and her coming (to Busra) and said, "She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter, but you people are being put to test in this issue."

Narrated by Abu Wail {#9:222 .italic}

Abu Musa and Abii Mas'ud went to 'Ammar when ‘Alí had sent him to Kufa to exhort them to fight (on ‘Alí's side). They said to him, "Since you have become a Muslim, we have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to us than your haste in this matter." 'Ammar said, "Since you (both) became Muslims, I have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to me than your keeping away from this matter." Then Abu Mas'ud provided 'Ammar and Abu Musa with two-piece outfits to wear, and one of them went to the mosque (of Kufa).

Narrated by Shaqiq bin Salama {#9:223 .italic}

I was sitting with Abu Mas'ud and Abu Musa and 'Ammar. Abu Mas'ud said (to 'Ammar), "There is none of your companions but, if I wish, I could find fault with him except with you. Since you joined the company of the Prophet I have never seen anything done by you more criticizable by me than your haste in this issue." 'Ammar said, O Abu Mas'ud ! I have never seen anything done by you or by this companion of yours (i.e., Abu Musa) more criticizable by me than your keeping away from this issue since the time you both joined the company of the Prophet." Then Abu Mas'ud who was a rich man, said (to his servant), "O boy! Bring two suits." Then he gave one to Abu Musa and the other to 'Ammar and said (to them), "Put on these suits before going for the Friday prayer."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#9:224 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "If Alláh sends punishment upon a nation then it befalls upon the whole population indiscriminately and then they will be resurrected (and judged) according to their deeds."

Narrated by Al-Ḥasan Al-Basri {#9:225 .italic}

When Al-Ḥasan bin ‘Alí moved with army units against Muawiya, 'Amr bin AL-As said to Muawiya, "I see an army that will not retreat unless and until the opposing army retreats." Muawiya said, "(If the Muslims are killed) who will look after their children?" 'Amr bin Al-As said: I (will look after them). On that, ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amir and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samura said, "Let us meet Muawaiya and suggest peace." Al-Ḥasan Al-Basri added: No doubt, I heard that Abu Bakra said, "Once while the Prophet was addressing (the people), Al-Ḥasan (bin ‘Alí) came and the Prophet said, 'This son of mine is a chief, and Alláh may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him."

Narrated by Harmala {#9:226 .italic}

(Usama's Maula) Usama (bin Zaid) sent me to ‘Alí (at Kufa) and said, "‘Alí will ask you, 'What has prevented your companion from joining me?' You then should say to him, 'If you (‘Alí) were in the mouth of a lion, I would like to be with you, but in this matter I won't take any part.' " Harmala added: "‘Alí didn't give me anything (when I conveyed the message to him) so I went to Ḥasan, Ḥusayn and Ibn Ja'far and they loaded my camels with much (wealth)."

Narrated by Nafi' {#9:227 .italic}

When the people of Medina dethroned Yazíd bin Muawiya, Ibn ‘Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, "I heard the Prophet saying, 'A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,' and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazíd) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Alláh and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Alláh and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazíd, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me."

Narrated by Abu Al-Minhal {#9:228 .italic}

When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-Zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra' (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, "O Abu Barza! Don't you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?" The first thing heard him saying "I seek reward from Alláh for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Alláh has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muḥammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Alláh, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Alláh, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Alláh, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain."

Narrated by Abi Waih {#9:229 .italic}

Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman said, 'The hypocrites of today are worse than those of the lifetime of the Prophet, because in those days they used to do evil deeds secretly but today they do such deeds openly.'

Narrated by Abi Asha'sha {#9:230 .italic}

Hudhaifa said, 'In fact, it was hypocrisy that existed in the lifetime of the Prophet but today it is Kufr (disbelief) after belief.'

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:231 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The Hour will not be established till a man passes by a grave of somebody and says, 'Would that I were in his place.' "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:232 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established till the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going round Dhi-al-Khalasa." Dhi-al-Khalasa was the idol of the Daus tribe which they used to worship in the Pre Islamic Period of ignorance.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:233 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established till a man from Qahtan appears, driving the people with his stick."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:235 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Soon the river "Euphrates" will disclose the treasure (the mountain) of gold, so whoever will be present at that time should not take anything of it."

Narrated by Haritha bin Wahb {#9:236 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "Give in charity because there will come a time on the people when a person will go out with his alms from place to place but will not find anybody to accept it."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:237 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claim that he is Alláh's Apostle, (3) till the religious knowledge is taken away (by the death of Religious scholars) (4) earthquakes will increase in number (5) time will pass quickly, (6) afflictions will appear, (7) Al-Harj, (i.e., killing) will increase, (8) till wealth will be in abundance... so abundant that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his Zakat, and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be offered) will say, 'I am not in need of it, (9) till the people compete with one another in constructing high buildings, (10) till a man when passing by a grave of someone will say, 'Would that I were in his place (11) and till the sun rises from the West. So when the sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam) but that will be the time when: (As Alláh said,) 'No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if it believed not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.' (6.158) And the Hour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it."

Narrated by Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba {#9:238 .italic}

Nobody asked the Prophet as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal. The Prophet said to me, "What worries you about him?" I said, "Because the people say that he will have a mountain of bread and a river of water with him (i.e. he will have abundance of food and water)" The Prophet said, "Nay, he is too mean to be allowed such a thing by Alláh"' (but it is only to test mankind whether they believe in Alláh or in Ad-Dajjal.)

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#9:239 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Ad-Dajjal will come and encamp at a place close to Medina and then Medina will shake thrice whereupon every Kafir (disbeliever) and hypocrite will go out (of Medina) towards him."

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#9:240 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate (guarding them).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#9:241 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle stood up amongst the people and then praised and glorified Alláh as He deserved and then he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, "I warn you of him, and there was no prophet but warned his followers of him; but I will tell you something about him which no prophet has told his followers: Ad-Dajjal is one-eyed whereas Alláh is not."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#9:242 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said. "While I was sleeping, I saw myself (in a dream) performing Tawaf around the Ka'ba. Behold, I saw a reddish-white man with lank hair, and water was dropping from his head. I asked, "Who is this?' They replied, 'The son of Mary.' Then I turned my face to see another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape. They said (to me), He is Ad-Dajjal." The Prophet added, "The man he resembled most is Ibn Qatan, a man from the tribe of Khuza'a."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#9:243 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle in his prayer, seeking refuge with Alláh from the afflictions of Ad-Dajjal.

Narrated by Hudhaifa {#9:244 .italic}

The Prophet said about Ad-Dajjal that he would have water and fire with him: (what would seem to be) fire, would be cold water and (what would seem to be) water, would be fire.

Narrated by Anas {#9:245 .italic}

The Prophet said, "No prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord is not so, and there will be written between his (Ad-Dajjal's) eyes (the word) Kafir (i.e., disbeliever)." (This Ḥadít_h is also quoted by Abu Huraira and Ibn ‘Abbás).

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd {#9:246 .italic}

One day Alláh's Apostle narrated to us a long narration about Ad-Dajjal and among the things he narrated to us, was: "Ad-Dajjal will come, and he will be forbidden to enter the mountain passes of Medina. He will encamp in one of the salt areas neighboring Medina and there will appear to him a man who will be the best or one of the best of the people. He will say 'I testify that you are Ad-Dajjal whose story Alláh's Apostle has told us.' Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), 'Look, if I kill this man and then give him life, will you have any doubt about my claim?' They will reply, 'No,' Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and then will make him alive. The man will say, 'By Alláh, now I recognize you more than ever!' Ad-Dajjal will then try to kill him (again) but he will not be given the power to do so."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:247 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "There are angels at the mountain passes of Medina (so that) neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal can enter it.'

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#9:248 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Ad-Dajjal will come to Medina and find the angels guarding it. So Alláh willing, neither Ad-Dajjal, nor plague will be able to come near it."

Narrated by Zainab bint Jahsh {#9:249 .italic}

That one day Alláh's Apostle entered upon her in a state of fear and said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh! Woe to the Arabs from the Great evil that has approached (them). Today a hole has been opened in the dam of Gog and Magog like this." The Prophet made a circle with his index finger and thumb. Zainab bint Jahsh added: I said, "O Alllah's Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though there will be righteous people among us?" The Prophet said, "Yes, if the (number) of evil (persons) increased."

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:250 .italic}

The Prophet said, "A hole has been opened in the dam of Gog and Magog." Wuhaib (the sub-narrator) made the number 90 (with his index finger and thumb).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#9:252 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Surely! Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charges: The Imam (ruler) of the people is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his family (household) and is responsible for his subjects; a woman is the guardian of her husband's home and of his children and is responsible for them; and the slave of a man is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for it. Surely, everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges."

That while he was included in a delegation of Quraish staying with Muawiya, Muawiya heard that ‘Abdu’lláh bin 'Amr had said that there would be a king from Qahtan tribe, whereupon he became very angry. He stood up, and after glorifying and praising Alláh as He deserved, said, "To proceed, I have come to know that some of you men are narrating things which are neither in Alláh's Book, nor has been mentioned by Alláh's Apostle . Such people are the ignorant among you. Beware of such vain desires that mislead those who have them. I have heard Alláh's Apostle saying, 'This matter (of the caliphate) will remain with the Quraish, and none will rebel against them, but Alláh will throw him down on his face as long as they stick to the rules and regulations of the religion (Islam).'"

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#9:256 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "You should listen to and obey, your ruler even if he was an Ethiopian (black) slave whose head looks like a raisin."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:257 .italic}

The Prophet said, "If somebody sees his Muslim ruler doing something he disapproves of, he should be patient, for whoever becomes separate from the Muslim group even for a span and then dies, he will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance (as rebellious sinners). (See Ḥadít_h No. 176 and 177)

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:258 .italic}

The Prophet said, "A Muslim has to listen to and obey (the order of his ruler) whether he likes it or not, as long as his orders involve not one in disobedience (to Alláh), but if an act of disobedience (to Alláh) is imposed one should not listen to it or obey it. (See Ḥadít_h No. 203, Vol. 4)

Narrated by ‘Alí {#9:259 .italic}

The Prophet sent an army unit (for some campaign) and appointed a man from the Ansar as its commander and ordered them (the soldiers) to obey him. (During the campaign) he became angry with them and said, "Didn't the Prophet order you to obey me?" They said, "Yes." He said, "I order you to collect wood and make a fire and then throw yourselves into it." So they collected wood and made a fire, but when they were about to throw themselves into, it they started looking at each other, and some of them said, "We followed the Prophet to escape from the fire. How should we enter it now?" So while they were in that state, the fire extinguished and their commander's anger abated. The event was mentioned to the Prophet and he said, "If they had entered it (the fire) they would never have come out of it, for obedience is required only in what is good." (See Ḥadít_h No. 629. Vol. 5)

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samura {#9:260 .italic}

The Prophet said, "O 'Abdur-Rahman! Do not seek to be a ruler, for if you are given authority on your demand then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking (for it), then you will be helped (by Alláh) in it. If you ever take an oath to do something and later on you find that something else is better, then you should expiate your oath and do what is better."

Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samura {#9:261 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "O 'Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, for if you are given authority on your demand, you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped (by Alláh) in it.

Jundab said, "I heard him saying, 'Whoever does a good deed in order to show off, Alláh will expose his intentions on the Day of Resurrection (before the people), and whoever puts the people into difficulties, Alláh will put him into difficulties on the Day of Resurrection.'" The people said (to Jundab), "Advise us." He said, "The first thing of the human body to purify is the abdomen, so he who can eat nothing but good food (Halal and earned lawfully) should do so, and he who does as much as he can that nothing intervene between him and Paradise by not shedding even a handful of blood, (i.e. murdering) should do so."

'Go away from me, for you do not know my calamity.'" Anas added, "The Prophet left her and proceeded. A man passed by her and asked her, 'What has Alláh's Apostle said to you?' She replied, 'I did not recognize him.' The man said, 'He was Alláh's Apostle."' Anas added, "So that woman came to the gate of the Prophet and she did not find a gate-keeper there, and she said, 'O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh. I did not recognize you!' The Prophet said, 'No doubt, patience is at the first stroke of a calamity.'"

A man came to Alláh's Apostle and said, "O Alláh's Apostle! By Alláh, I fail to attend the morning congregational prayer because so-and-so (i.e., Muadh bin Jabal) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it." I had never seen the Prophet more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. He then said, "O people! some of you make others dislike (good deeds, i.e. prayers etc). So whoever among you leads the people in prayer, he should shorten it because among them there are the old, the weak and the busy (needy having some jobs to do). (See Ḥadít_h No. 90, Vol. 1)

I said, "I have horses and slaves and I am living in prosperity and I wish that my payment should be kept as a charitable gift for the Muslims." ‘Umar said, "Do not do so, for I intended to do the same as you do. Alláh's Apostles used to give me gifts and I used to say to him, 'Give it to a more needy one than me.' Once he gave me some money and I said, 'Give it to a more needy person than me,' whereupon the Prophet said, 'Take it and keep it in your possession and then give it in charity. Take what ever comes to you of this money if you are not keen to have it and not asking for it; otherwise (i.e., if it does not come to you) do not seek to have it yourself.' " Narrated ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar: I have heard ‘Umar saying, "The Prophet used to give me some money (grant) and I would say (to him), 'Give it to a more needy one than me.' Once he gave me some money and I said, 'Give it to a more needy one than me.' The Prophet said (to me), 'Take it and keep it in your possession and then give it in charity. Take whatever comes to you of this money while you are not keen to have it and not asking for it; take it, but you should not seek to have what you are not given.'"

Alláh's Apostle said, "I am only a human being, and you people (opponents) come to me with your cases; and it may be that one of you can present his case eloquently in a more convincing way than the other, and I give my verdict according to what I hear. So if ever I judge (by error) and give the right of a brother to his other (brother) then he (the latter) should not take it, for I am giving him only a piece of Fire." (See Ḥadít_h No. 638, Vol. 3).

Narrated by Abu Qatada {#9:282 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said on the Day of (the battle of) Hunain, "Whoever has killed an infidel and has a proof or a witness for it, then the salb (arms and belongings of that deceased) will be for him." I stood up to seek a witness to testify that I had killed an infidel but I could not find any witness and then sat down. Then I thought that I should mention the case to Alláh's Apostle I (and when I did so) a man from those who were sitting with him said, "The arms of the killed person he has mentioned, are with me, so please satisfy him on my behalf." Abu Bakr said, "No, he will not give the arms to a bird of Quraish and deprive one of Alláh's lions of it who fights for the cause of Alláh and His Apostle." Alláh's Apostle I stood up and gave it to me, and I bought a garden with its price, and that was my first property which I owned through the war booty. The people of Ḥijáz said, "A judge should not pass a judgment according to his knowledge, whether he was a witness at the time he was the judge or before that" And if a litigant gives a confession in favor of his opponent in the court, in the opinion of some scholars, the judge should not pass a judgment against him till the latter calls two witnesses to witness his confession. And some people of ‘Iráq said, "A judge can pass a judgement according to what he hears or witnesses (the litigant's confession) in the court itself, but if the confession takes place outside the court, he should not pass the judgment unless two witnesses witness the confession." Some of them said, "A judge can pass a judgement depending on his knowledge of the case as he is trust-worthy, and that a witness is Required just to reveal the truth. The judge's knowledge is more than the witness." Some said, "A judge can judge according to his knowledge only in cases involving property, but in other cases he cannot." Al-Qasim said, "A judge ought not to pass a judgment depending on his knowledge if other people do not know what he knows, although his knowledge is more than the witness of somebody else because he might expose himself to suspicion by the Muslims and cause the Muslims to have unreasonable doubt."

Narrated by ‘Alí bin Ḥusayn {#9:283 .italic}

Safiya bint (daughter of) Huyai came to the Prophet (in the mosque), and when she returned (home), the Prophet accompanied her.

The Prophet said, "Satan circulates in the human body as blood does."

The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Bani Asad, called Ibn Al-Utabiyya to collect the Zakat. When he returned (with the money) he said (to the Prophet), "This is for you and this has been given to me as a gift." The Prophet stood up on the pulpit (Sufyan said he ascended the pulpit), and after glorifying and praising Alláh, he said, "What is wrong with the employee whom we send (to collect Zakat from the public) that he returns to say, 'This is for you and that is for me?' Why didn't he stay at his father's and mother's house to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Him in Whose Hand my life is, whoever takes anything illegally will bring it on the Day of Resurrection by carrying it over his neck: if it is a camel, it will be grunting: if it is a cow, it will be mooing: and if it is a sheep it will be bleating!" The Prophet then raised both his hands till we saw the whiteness of his armpits (and he said), "No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Alláh's Message?" And he repeated it three times.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Umar {#9:287 .italic}

If ever I pass a judgment in favor of somebody whereby he takes a Muslim's right unjustly, then whatever he takes is nothing but a piece of Fire, and it is up to him to take or leave."

Narrated by 'Aisha {#9:293 .italic}

So in the year of Conquest of Mecca, Sa'd took him and said. (This is) my brother's son whom my brother has asked me to take into my custody." 'Abd bin Zam'a got up before him and said, (He is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on my father's bed." So they both submitted their case before Alláh's Apostle. Sa'd said, "O Alláh's Apostle! This boy is the son of my brother and he entrusted him to me." 'Abd bin Zam'a said, "This boy is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on the bed of my father." Alláh's Apostle said, "The boy is for you, O 'Abd bin Zam'a!" Then Alláh's Apostle further said, "The child is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the adulterer," He then said to Sauda bint Zam'a, "Veil (screen) yourself before him," when he saw the child's resemblance to 'Utba. The boy did not see her again till he met Alláh.

Al-Ashath said, "This verse was revealed regarding me and another man with whom I had a quarrel about a well. The Prophet said (to me), "Do you have any evidence?' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Let your opponent take an oath.' I said: I am sure he would take a (false) oath." Thereupon it was revealed: 'Verily! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Alláh's Covenant...' (3.77) (See Ḥadít_h No. 72, Vol 6).

Narrated by Um Salama {#9:295 .italic}

The Prophet heard the voices of some people quarreling near his gate, so he went to them and said, "I am only a human being and litigants with cases of disputes come to me, and maybe one of them presents his case eloquently in a more convincing and impressive way than the other, and I give my verdict in his favor thinking he is truthful. So if I give a Muslim's right to another (by mistake), then that (property) is a piece of Fire, which is up to him to take it or leave it." (See Ḥadít_h No. 281)

Narrated by Jabir {#9:296 .italic}

The Prophet said (to the people), "If you are criticizing his leadership now, then you used to criticize his father's leadership before.

I said, "By Alláh, I shall not kill my captive and none of my companions shall kill his captive!" Then we mentioned that to the Prophet and he said, "O Alláh! I am free from what Khalid bin Al-Walid has done," and repeated it twice.

There was some quarrel (sighting) among Bani 'Amr, and when this news reached the Prophet, he offered the Zuhr prayer and went to establish peace among them. In the meantime the time of 'Asr prayer was due, Bilal pronounced the Adhan and then the Iqama for the prayer and requested Abu Bakr (to lead the prayer) and Abu Bakr went forward. The Prophet arrived while Abu Bakr was still praying. He entered the rows of praying people till he stood behind Abu Bakr in the (first) row. The people started clapping, and it was the habit of Abu Bakr that whenever he stood for prayer, he never glanced side-ways till he had finished it, but when Abu Bakr observed that the clapping was not coming to an end, he looked and saw the Prophet standing behind him. The Prophet beckoned him to carry on by waving his hand. Abu Bakr stood there for a while, thanking Alláh for the saying of the Prophet and then he retreated, taking his steps backwards. When the Prophet saw that, he went ahead and led the people in prayer. When he finished the prayer, he said, "O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from carrying on with the prayer after I beckoned you to do so?" Abu Bakr replied, "It does not befit the son of Abi Quhafa to lead the Prophet in prayer." Then the Prophet said to the people, "If some problem arises during prayers, then the men should say, Subhan Alláh!; and the women should clap." (See Ḥadít_h No. 652, Vol. 1)

Narrated by Zaid bin Thabit {#9:301 .italic}

Abu Bakr sent for me owing to the large number of casualties in the battle of Al-Yamama, while ‘Umar was sitting with him. Abu Bakr said (to me), ‘Umar has come to my and said, 'A great number of Qaris of the Holy Qur’án were killed on the day of the battle of Al-Yamama, and I am afraid that the casualties among the Qaris of the Qur’án may increase on other battle-fields whereby a large part of the Qur’án may be lost. Therefore I consider it advisable that you (Abu Bakr) should have the Qur’án collected.' I said, 'How dare I do something which Alláh's Apostle did not do?' ‘Umar said, By Alláh, it is something beneficial.' ‘Umar kept on pressing me for that till Alláh opened my chest for that for which He had opened the chest of ‘Umar and I had in that matter, the same opinion as ‘Umar had." Abu Bakr then said to me (Zaid), "You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Alláh's Apostle. So you should search for the fragmentary scripts of the Qur’án and collect it (in one Book)." Zaid further said: By Alláh, if Abu Bakr had ordered me to shift a mountain among the mountains from one place to another it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur’án. Then I said (to ‘Umar and Abu Bakr), "How can you do something which Alláh's Apostle did not do?" Abu Bakr said, "By Alláh, it is something beneficial." Zaid added: So he (Abu Bakr) kept on pressing me for that until Alláh opened my chest for that for which He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and I had in that matter, the same opinion as theirs. So I started compiling the Qur’án by collecting it from the leafless stalks of the date-palm tree and from the pieces of leather and hides and from the stones, and from the chests of men (who had memorized the Qur’án). I found the last verses of Sirat-at-Tauba: ("Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muḥammad) from amongst yourselves' (9.128-129) ) from Khuzaima or Abi Khuzaima and I added to it the rest of the Sura. The manuscripts of the Qur’án remained with Abu Bakr till Alláh took him unto Him. Then it remained with ‘Umar till Alláh took him unto Him, and then with Hafsa bint ‘Umar.

Then Muhaiyisa was informed that ‘Abdu’lláh had been killed and thrown in a pit or a spring. Muhaiyisa went to the Jews and said, "By Alláh, you have killed my companion." The Jews said, "By Alláh, we have not killed him." Muhaiyisa then came back to his people and told them the story. He, his elder brother Huwaiyisa and 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl came (to the Prophet) and he who had been at Khaibar, proceeded to speak, but the Prophet said to Muhaiyisa, "The eldest! The eldest!" meaning, "Let the eldest of you speak." So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then Muhaiyisa. Alláh's Apostle said, "The Jews should either pay the blood money of your (deceased) companion or be ready for war." After that Alláh's Apostle wrote a letter to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote that they had not killed him. Then Alláh's Apostle said to Huwaiyisa, Muhaiyisa and 'Abdur-Rahman, "Can you take an oath by which you will be entitled to take the blood money?" They said, "No." He said (to them), "Shall we ask the Jews to take an oath before you?" They replied, "But the Jews are not Muslims." So Alláh's Apostle gave them one-hundred she-camels as blood money from himself. Sahl added: When those she-camels were made to enter the house, one of them kicked me with its leg.

The bedouin said, "My son was a laborer for this man and committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people said to me, 'Your son is to be stoned to death,' so I ransomed my son for one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious learned men and they said to me, 'Your son has to receive one hundred lashes plus one year of exile.' " The Prophet said, "I shall judge between you according to Alláh's Book (Laws)! As for the slave girl and the sheep, it shall be returned to you, and your son shall receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O you, Unais!" The Prophet addressed some man, "Go in the morning to the wife of this man and stone her to death." So Unais went to her the next morning and stoned her to death.

The Prophet employed Ibn Al-Utbiyya to collect Zakat from Bani Sulaim, and when he returned (with the money) to Alláh's Apostle the Prophet called him to account, and he said, "This (amount) is for you, and this was given to me as a present." Alláh's Apostle said, "Why don't you stay at your father's house or your mother's house to see whether you will be given gifts or not, if you are telling the truth?" Then Alláh's Apostle stood up and addressed the people, and after glorifying and praising Alláh, he said: Amma Ba'du (then after) I employ some men from among you for some job which Alláh has placed in my charge, and then one of you comes to me and says, 'This (amount) is for you and this is a gift given to me.' Why doesn't he stay at the house of his father or the house of his mother and see whether he will be given gifts or not if he was telling the truth by Alláh, none of you takes anything of it (i.e., Zakat) for himself (Hisham added: unlawfully) but he will meet Alláh on the Day of Resurrection carrying it on his neck! I do not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep on meeting Alláh." Then the Prophet raised both his hands till I saw the whiteness of his armpits, and said, "(No doubt)! Haven't I conveyed Alláh's Message!"

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#9:306 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Alláh never sends a prophet or gives the Caliphate to a Caliph but that he (the prophet or the Caliph) has two groups of advisors: A group advising him to do good and exhorts him to do it, and the other group advising him to do evil and exhorts him to do it. But the protected person (against such evil advisors) is the one protected by Alláh.'"

Narrated by Al-Miswar bin Makhrama {#9:314 .italic}

The group of people whom ‘Umar had selected as candidates for the Caliphate gathered and consulted each other. Abdur-Rahman said to them, "I am not going to compete with you in this matter, but if you wish, I would select for you a caliph from among you." So all of them agreed to let 'Abdur-Rahman decide the case. So when the candidates placed the case in the hands of 'Abdur-Rahman, the people went towards him and nobody followed the rest of the group nor obeyed any after him. So the people followed 'Abdur-Rahman and consulted him all those nights till there came the night we gave the oath of allegiance to 'Uthman. Al-Miswar (bin Makhrama) added: 'Abdur-Rahman called on me after a portion of the night had passed and knocked on my door till I got up, and he said to me, "I see you have been sleeping! By Alláh, during the last three nights I have not slept enough. Go and call Az-Zubair and Sa'd.' So I called them for him and he consulted them and then called me saying, 'Call ‘Alí for me." I called ‘Alí and he held a private talk with him till very late at night, and then 'Al, got up to leave having had much hope (to be chosen as a Caliph) but 'Abdur-Rahman was afraid of something concerning ‘Alí. 'Abdur-Rahman then said to me, "Call 'Uthman for me." I called him and he kept on speaking to him privately till the Mu'adhdhin put an end to their talk by announcing the Adhan for the Fajr prayer. When the people finished their morning prayer and that (six men) group gathered near the pulpit, 'Abdur-Rahman sent for all the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar present there and sent for the army chief who had performed the Hajj with ‘Umar that year. When all of them had gathered, 'Abdur-Rahman said, "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh," and added, "Now then, O ‘Alí, I have looked at the people's tendencies and noticed that they do not consider anybody equal to 'Uthman, so you should not incur blame (by disagreeing)." Then 'Abdur-Rahman said (to 'Uthman), "I gave the oath of allegiance to you on condition that you will follow Alláh's Laws and the traditions of Alláh's Apostle and the traditions of the two Caliphs after him." So 'Abdur-Rahman gave the oath of allegiance to him, and so did the people including the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar and the chiefs of the army staff and all the Muslims.

We gave the oath of allegiance to the Prophet under the tree. He said to me, "O Salama! Will you not give the oath of allegiance?" I replied, "O Alláh's Apostle! I have already given the oath of allegiance for the first time." He said, (Give it again) for the second time.

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:319 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "There will be three types of people whom Alláh will neither speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will purify them from sins, and they will have a painful punishment: They are, (1) a man possessed superfluous water (more than he needs) on a way and he withholds it from the travelers. (2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to an Imam (ruler) and gives it only for worldly benefits, if the Imam gives him what he wants, he abides by his pledge, otherwise he does not fulfill his pledge; (3) and a man who sells something to another man after the 'Asr prayer and swears by Alláh (a false oath) that he has been offered so much for it whereupon the buyer believes him and buys it although in fact, the seller has not been offered such a price." (See Ḥadít_h No. 838, Vol. 3)

The Prophet added: Whoever amongst you fulfill his pledge, his reward will be with Alláh, and whoever commits any of those sins and receives the legal punishment in this world for that sin, then that punishment will be an expiation for that sin, and whoever commits any of those sins and Alláh does not expose him, then it is up to Alláh if He wishes He will punish him or if He wishes, He will forgive him." So we gave the Pledge for that. (See Ḥadít_h No. 17, Vol. 1)

Narrated by Um Atiyya {#9:322 .italic}

We gave the Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet and he recited to me the verse (60.12). That they will not associate anything in worship with Alláh (60.12).

A woman from us held her hand out and said, "Such-and-such a woman cried over a dead person belonging to my family and I want to compensate her for that crying" The Prophet did not say anything in reply and she left and returned. None of those women abided by her pledge except Um Sulaim, Um Al-‘Alá’, and the daughter of Abi Sabra, the wife of Al-Muadh or the daughter of Abi Sabra, and the wife of Mu'adh.

'Aisha said, "O my head!" Alláh's Apostle said, "If that (i.e., your death) should happen while I am still alive, I would ask Alláh to forgive you and would invoke Alláh for you." 'Aisha said, "O my life which is going to be lost! By Alláh, I think that you wish for my death, and if that should happen then you would be busy enjoying the company of one of your wives in the last part of that day." The Prophet said, "But I should say, 'O my head!' I feel like calling Abu Bakr and his son and appoint (the former as my successors lest people should say something or wish for something. Alláh will insist (on Abu Bakr becoming a Caliph) and the believers will prevent (anyone else from claiming the Caliphate)," or "...Alláh will prevent (anyone else from claiming the Caliphate) and the believers will insist (on Abu Bakr becoming the Caliph)."

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#9:325 .italic}

It was said to ‘Umar, "Will you appoint your successor?" ‘Umar said, "If I appoint a Caliph (as my successor) it is true that somebody who was better than I (i.e., Abu Bakr) did so, and if I leave the matter undecided, it is true that somebody who was better than I (i.e., Alláh's Apostle) did so." On this, the people praised him. ‘Umar said, "People are of two kinds: Either one who is keen to take over the Caliphate or one who is afraid of assuming such a responsibility. I wish I could be free from its responsibility in that I would receive neither reward nor retribution I won't bear the burden of the caliphate in my death as I do in my life."

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#9:326 .italic}

That he heard ‘Umar's second speech he delivered when he sat on the pulpit on the day following the death of the Prophet ‘Umar recited the Tashahhud while Abu Bakr was silent. ‘Umar said, "I wish that Alláh's Apostle had outlived all of us, i.e., had been the last (to die). But if Muḥammad is dead, Alláh nevertheless has kept the light amongst you from which you can receive the same guidance as Alláh guided Muḥammad with that. And Abu Bakr is the companion of Alláh's Apostle He is the second of the two in the cave. He is the most entitled person among the Muslims to manage your affairs. Therefore get up and swear allegiance to him." Some people had already taken the oath of allegiance to him in the shed of Bani Sa‘ída but the oath of allegiance taken by the public was taken at the pulpit. I heard ‘Umar saying to Abu Bakr on that day. "Please ascend the pulpit," and kept on urging him till he ascended the pulpit whereupon, all the people swore allegiance to him.

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, if anyone of you had known that he would receive a bone covered with meat or two (small) pieces of meat present in between two ribs, he would come for 'Isha' prayer."

We were in the company of Alláh's Apostle and we assumed the state of Ihram of Hajj and arrived at Mecca on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The Prophet ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka'ba and (Sa'i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and use our lhram just for 'Umra, and finish the state of Ihram unless we had our Hádí with us. None of us had the Hádí with him except the Prophet and Talha. 1AIj came from Yemen and brought the Hádí with him. ‘Alí said, 'I had assumed the state of Ihram with the same intention as that with which Alláh's Apostle had assumed it. The people said, "How can we proceed to Mina and our male organs are dribbling?" Alláh's Apostle said, "If I had formerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought the Hádí, and had there been no Hádí with me, I would have finished my Ihram." Suraqa (bin Malik) met the Prophet while he was throwing pebbles at the Jamrat-al-'Áqába, and asked, "O Alláh's Apostle! Is this (permitted) for us only?" The Prophet replied. "No, it is forever" 'Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she was menstruating, therefore the Prophet ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of Hajj except the Tawaf around the Ka'ba, and not to perform her prayers unless and until she became clean . When they encamped at Al-Batha, 'Aisha said, "O Alláh's Apostle! You are proceeding after performing both Hajj and 'Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj only?" So the Prophet ordered 'Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to At-Tan'im, and so she performed the 'Umra in Dhul-Hijja after the days of the Hajj.

So (O Alláh!) please send tranquility (Sakina) upon us as they, (the chiefs of the enemy tribes) have rebelled against us.

He said, "(Because) your people ran short of money." I asked, "Then why is its gate so high?" He replied, ''Your people did so in order to admit to it whom they would and forbid whom they would. Were your people not still close to the period of ignorance, and were I not afraid that their hearts might deny my action, then surely I would include the wall in the Ka'ba and make its gate touch the ground."

Between you and us there are the infidels of the tribe of Mudar, so please order us to do something good (religious deeds) that by acting on them we may enter Paradise, and that we may inform (our people) whom we have left behind, about it." They also asked (the Prophet) about drinks. He forbade them from four things and ordered them to do four things. He ordered them to believe in Alláh, and asked them, "Do you know what is meant by belief in Alláh?" They said, "Alláh and His Apostle know best." He said, ''To testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, the One, Who has no partners with Him, and that Muḥammad is Alláh's Apostle; and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay Zakat." (the narrator thinks that fasting in Ramaḍán is included), "and to give one-fifth of the war booty (to the state)." Then he forbade four (drinking utensils): Ad-Duba', Al-Hantam, Al-Mazaffat and An-Naqir, or probably, Al-Muqaiyar. And then the Prophet said, "Remember all these things by heart and preach it to those whom you have left behind."

Ash-'Sha'bi asked me, "Did you notice how Al-Ḥasan used to narrate Hádíths from the Prophets? I stayed with Ibn ‘Umar for about two or one-and-half years and I did not hear him narrating any thing from the Prophet except his (Ḥadít_h): He (Ibn ‘Umar) said, "Some of the companions of the Prophet including Sa'd, were going to eat meat, but one of the wives of the Prophet called them, saying, 'It is the neat of a Mastigure.' The people then stopped eating it. On that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Carry on eating, for it is lawful.' Or said, 'There is no harm in eating it, but it is not from my meals."

I realized that he was being Divinely Inspired, so I kept away from him till the inspiration was over. Then the Prophet said, "(O Muḥammad) they ask you regarding the spirit, Say: The spirit its knowledge is with my Lord (i.e., nobody has its knowledge except Alláh)" (17.85) (This is a miracle of the Qur’án that all the scientists up till now do not know about the spirit, i.e, how life comes to a body and how it goes away at its death) (See Ḥadít_h No. 245, Vol. 6)

Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar, "You intended only to oppose me." ‘Umar said, "I did not intend to oppose you!" Then their voices grew louder in front of the Prophet whereupon there was revealed: 'O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet... a great reward.'

'Uwaimir Al-'Ajlani came to 'Asim bin 'Adi and said, "If a man found another man with his wife and killed him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O 'Asim! Please ask Alláh's Apostle about this matter on my behalf." 'Asim asked the Prophet but the Prophet disliked the question and disapproved of it. 'Asim returned and informed 'Uwaimir that the Prophet disliked that type of question. 'Uwaimir said, "By Alláh, I will go (personally) to the Prophet." 'Uwaimir came to the Prophet when Alláh had already revealed Qur’ánic Verses (in that respect), after 'Asim had left (the Prophet ). So the Prophet said to 'Uwaimir, "Alláh has revealed Qur’ánic Verses regarding you and your wife." The Prophet then called for them, and they came and carried out the order of Lian. Then 'Uwaimir said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a lie." So 'Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li'an. The Prophet said (to the people). "Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then I will be of the opinion that he ('Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with big buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her." 'Ultimately she gave birth to a child that proved the accusation. (See Ḥadít_h No. 269, Vol. 6)

I proceeded till I entered upon ‘Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, " 'Uthman, 'Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa'd ask your permission to come in." ‘Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, "Shall I admit ‘Alí and ‘Abbás?'' ‘Umar allowed them to enter. Al-‘Abbás said "O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor (‘Alí)." Then there was a dispute (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them (‘Abbás and ‘Alí). 'Uthman and his companions said, "O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other." ‘Umar said, "Be patient! beseech you by Alláh, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Alláh's Apostle said, 'Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,' and by this Alláh's Apostle meant himself?" On that the group said, "He verily said so." ‘Umar then faced ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "I beseech you both by Alláh, do you both know that Alláh's Apostle said so?" They both replied, "Yes". ‘Umar then said, "Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Alláh favored Alláh's Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Alláh said: 'What Alláh bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition... ' (59.6) So that property was totally meant for Alláh's Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Alláh's wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Alláh, do you know that?" They replied, "Yes." ‘Umar then addressed ‘Alí and ‘Abbás, saying, "I beseech you both by Alláh, do you know that?" Both of them replied, "Yes." ‘Umar added, "Then Alláh took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said 'I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle' and took over all the Prophet's property and disposed of it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle used to do, and you were present then." Then he turned to ‘Alí and ‘Abbás and said, "You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Alláh knows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it. Then Alláh took Abu Bakr unto Him, 'I said: I am the successor of Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr.' So I took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle, and Abu Bakr used to do. Then you both (‘Alí and ‘Abbás) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O ‘Abbás! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew's property; and this (‘Alí) came to me asking for his wives share from her father's property, and I said to you both, 'If you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Alláh's Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to me anymore about it.' Then you both said, 'Give it to us on that (condition).' So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Alláh, did I not give it to them on that condition?" The group (whom he had been addressing) replied, "Yes." ‘Umar then addressed ‘Abbás and ‘Alí saying, "I beseech you both by Alláh, didn't I give you all that property on that condition?" They said, "Yes." ‘Umar then said, "Are you now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf."

" Abu Wail said, "I witnessed the battle of Siffin, and how nasty Siffin was!"

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:454 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Alláh's Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Alláh's right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Alláh's Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin." Then Alláh's Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, "Alláh has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse: "Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it." (99.7-8)

Ibn ‘Abbás said, "Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Qur’án) which has been revealed to Alláh's Apostle is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Alláh has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, 'It is from Alláh,' to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Alláh, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!"

After the slanderers had given a forged statement against her, Alláh's Apostle called ‘Alí bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration was delayed.

Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but ‘Alí said, "Alláh has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth." So the Prophet asked Barira (my salve girl), "Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?" She replied, "I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it." Then the Prophet stood on the pulpit and said, "O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Alláh, I know nothing about my family except good." The narrator added: Then the Prophet mentioned the innocence of 'Aisha. (See Ḥadít_h No. 274, Vol. 6)

I heard Jabir bin ‘Abdu’lláh in a gathering saying, "We, the companions of Alláh's Apostle assumed the state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without 'Umra." Jabir added, "The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, "Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation)." Jabir added, "The Prophet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that we were saying, "When there remains only five days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to 'Arafat with our male organs dribbling with semen?' (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). Alláh's Apostle stood up and said, 'You (People) know that I am the most Alláh-fearing, the most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hádí with me, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hádí with me.' So we finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him." (See Ḥadít_h No. 713, Vol. 2)

When the time of the death of the Prophet approached while there were some men in the house, and among them was ‘Umar bin Al-Khatttab, the Prophet said, "Come near let me write for you a writing after which you will never go astray." ‘Umar said, "The Prophet is seriously ill, and you have the Qur’án, so Alláh's Book is sufficient for us." The people in the house differed and disputed. Some of them said, "Come near so that Alláh's Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray," while some of them said what ‘Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, "Go away and leave me." Ibn ‘Abbás used to say, "It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Alláh's Apostle from writing that writing for them.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:469 .italic}

When the Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen, he said to him, "You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Alláh. If they learn that, tell them that Alláh has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if they pray, tell them that Alláh has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that, then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people."

Narrated by Mu'adh bin Jabal {#9:470 .italic}

The Prophet said, "O Mu'adh! Do you know what Alláh's Right upon His slaves is?" I said, "Alláh and His Apostle know best." The Prophet said, "To worship Him (Alláh) Alone and to join none in worship with Him (Alláh). Do you know what their right upon Him is?" I replied, "Alláh and His Apostle know best." The Prophet said, "Not to punish them (if they do so)."

A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): 'Say (O Muḥammad): "He is Alláh, the One." (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Alláh's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Qur’án."

The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the Sura 112): 'Say (O Muḥammad): "He is Alláh, the One." ' (112.1) When they returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them), "Ask him why he does so." They asked him and he said, "I do so because it mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer)." The Prophet; said (to them), "Tell him that Alláh loves him"

The Prophet said (to the messenger), "Go back and tell her that whatever Alláh takes is His, and whatever He gives is His, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world).

So the Prophets got up, and so did Sa'd bin 'Ubada and Mu'adh bin Jabal (and went to her). When the child was brought to the Prophet his breath was disturbed in his chest as if it were in a water skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet . became flooded with tears, whereupon Sa'd said to him, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is this?"

When I see my Lord, I will fall down in (prostration) before Him and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He wishes, and then it will be said to me, 'O Muḥammad! Raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will then raise my head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will intercede. Alláh will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit whom I will admit into Paradise.

Alláh will allow me to intercede (for a certain kind of people) and will fix a limit to whom I will admit into Paradise. I will come back and say, 'O my Lord! None remains in Hell (Fire) but those whom Qur’án has imprisoned therein and for whom eternity in Hell (Fire) has become inevitable.' " The Prophet added, "There will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: 'La ilaha illal-lah,' and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a barley grain. Then there will come out of Hell (Fire) everyone who says: ' La ilaha illal-lah,' and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain.

Alláh's Apostle used to say at the time of difficulty, "None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, the Majestic, the Most Forbearing. None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. None has the right to be worshipped but Alláh, the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the Honourable Throne. (See Ḥadít_h No. 357, Vol. 8)

When ‘Alí was in Yemen, he sent some gold in its ore to the Prophet. The Prophet distributed it among Al-Aqra' bin Habis Al-Hanzali who belonged to Bani Mujashi, 'Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, 'Alqama bin 'Ulatha Al-'Amiri, who belonged to the Bani Kilab tribe and Zaid AI-Khail At-Ta'i who belonged to Bani Nabhan. So the Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, "He gives to the chiefs of Najd and leaves us!" The Prophet said, "I just wanted to attract and unite their hearts (make them firm in Islam)." Then there came a man with sunken eyes, bulging forehead, thick beard, fat raised cheeks, and clean-shaven head, and said, "O Muḥammad! Be afraid of Alláh! " The Prophet said, "Who would obey Alláh if I disobeyed Him? (Alláh). He trusts me over the people of the earth, but you do not trust me?" A man from the people (present then), who, I think, was Khalid bin Al-Walid, asked for permission to kill him, but the Prophet prevented him. When the man went away, the Prophet said, "Out of the offspring of this man, there will be people who will recite the Qur’án but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the game, and they will kill the Muslims and leave the idolators. Should I live till they appear, I would kill them as the Killing of the nation of 'Ad."

I asked the Prophet regarding the Verse: 'And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term decreed for it.' (36.28) He said, "Its fixed course is underneath Alláh's Throne."

We were sitting with the Prophet and he looked at the moon on the night of the full-moon and said, "You people will see your Lord as you see this full moon, and you will have no trouble in seeing Him, so if you can avoid missing (through sleep or business, etc.) a prayer before sunrise (Fajr) and a prayer before sunset (Asr) you must do so." (See Ḥadít_h No. 529, Vol. 1)

Alláh's Apostle came out to us on the night of the full moon and said, "You will see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection as you see this (full moon) and you will have no difficulty in seeing Him."

Narrated by 'Ata' bin Yazíd Al-Laithi {#9:532 .italic}

On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" The Prophet said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?" They said, "No, O Alláh's Apostle." He said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?" They said, "No, O Alláh's Apostle." He said, "So you will see Him, like that. Alláh will gather all the people on the Day of Resurrection, and say, 'Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that thing),' so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Alláh will come to them and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will (deny Him and) say, 'We will stay here till our Lord comes, for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.' So Alláh will come to them in His appearance which they know, and will say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our Lord,' so they will follow Him. Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)' I and my followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, 'O Alláh, save! Save!' In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa'dan (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa'dan? " They replied, "Yes, O Alláh's Apostle!" He said, "So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa'dan, but none knows how big they are except Alláh. Those hooks will snap the people away according to their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil) deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be punished and then relieved. When Alláh has finished His Judgments among the people, He will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Alláh from among those whom Alláh wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the right to be worshipped but Alláh. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as Alláh has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the mud of the torrent. Then Alláh will finish the judgments among the people, and there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, 'O my Lord! Please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.' So he will invoke Alláh in the way Alláh will wish him to invoke, and then Alláh will say to him, 'If I grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply, 'No, by Your Power, (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.' He will give his Lord whatever promises and covenants Alláh will demand. So Alláh will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Alláh will wish him to remain quiet, then he will say, 'O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.' Alláh will say to him, 'Didn't you give your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam's son! How treacherous you are!' He will say, 'O my lord,' and will keep on invoking Alláh till He says to him, 'If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?' He will reply, 'No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.' Then he will give covenants and promises to Alláh and then Alláh will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise, Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Alláh will wish him to remain quiet, and then he will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.' Alláh will say, 'Didn't you give your covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been given?' Alláh will say, 'Woe on you, O Adam's son! How treacherous you are! ' The man will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most miserable of Your creation,' and he will keep on invoking Alláh till Alláh will laugh because of his sayings, and when Alláh will laugh because of him, He will say to him, 'Enter Paradise,' and when he will enter it, Alláh will say to him, 'Wish for anything.' So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Alláh Himself will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, '(Wish for) so-and-so.' When there is nothing more to wish for, Alláh will say, 'This is for you, and its equal (is for you) as well." 'Ata' bin Yazíd added: Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri who was present with Abu Huraira, did not deny whatever the latter said, but when Abu Huraira said that Alláh had said, "That is for you and its equal as well," Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri said, "And ten times as much, O Abu Huraira!" Abu Huraira said, "I do not remember, except his saying, 'That is for you and its equal as well.'" Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri then said, "I testify that I remember the Prophet saying, 'That is for you, and ten times as much.' ' Abu Huraira then added, "That man will be the last person of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise."

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#9:532 .italic}

We said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" He said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?" We said, "No." He said, "So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky)." The Prophet then said, "Somebody will then announce, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship.' So the companions of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain those who used to worship Alláh, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, "What did you use to worship?' They will reply, 'We used to worship Ezra, the son of Alláh.' It will be said to them, 'You are liars, for Alláh has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?' They will reply, 'We want You to provide us with water.' Then it will be said to them 'Drink,' and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, 'What did you use to worship?' They will reply, 'We used to worship Messiah, the son of Alláh.' It will be said, 'You are liars, for Alláh has neither a wife nor a son. What: do you want (now)?' They will say, 'We want You to provide us with water.' It will be said to them, 'Drink,' and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who used to worship Alláh (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, 'What keeps you here when all the people have gone?' They will say, 'We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, 'Let every nation follow what they used to worship,' and now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, 'I am your Lord,' and they will say, 'You are not our Lord.' And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, 'Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?' They will say. 'The Shin,' and so Alláh will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell." We, the companions of the Prophet said, "O Alláh's Apostle! What is the bridge?' He said, "It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa'dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge)." The Prophet said, "You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. They will say, 'O Alláh! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.' Alláh will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.' Alláh will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Alláh will say (to them), 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.' They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Alláh will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize." Abu Sa‘íd said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse: 'Surely! Alláh wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.' (4.40) The Prophet added, "Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Alláh) will say, 'Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, 'These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for themselves).' Then it will be said to them, 'For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.'"

Narrated by Anas {#9:532 .italic}

The Prophet said, "The believers will be kept (waiting) on the Day of Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say, "Let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from our place. Then they will go to Adam and say, 'You are Adam, the father of the people. Alláh created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours? Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will mention his mistakes he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He will add, 'Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Alláh to the people of the Earth.' The people will go to Noah who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking' He will mention his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.' He will say (to them), 'Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.' They will go to Abraham who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say (to them). 'Go to Moses, a slave whom Alláh gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and brought near Him, for conversation.' They will go to Moses who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to them), 'Go to Jesus, Alláh's slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His Word.' (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking but you'd better go to Muḥammad the slave whose past and future sins have been forgiven by Alláh.' So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord's permission to enter His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will say, 'O Muḥammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:' Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me. Alláh will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them out and make them enter Paradise." (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the Prophet said, "I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I will be permitted. When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and then He will say, 'O Muḥammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.' " The Prophet added, "So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise." (Qatada added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, 'I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter. When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him, and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, 'Raise your head, O Muḥammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.' So I will raise my head and praise Alláh as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise." (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, "So I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain in the Fire except those whom Qur’án will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for eternal life in the fire)." The narrator then recited the Verse: "It may be that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.' (17.79) The narrator added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Alláh has promised to your Prophet.

All the Praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth and whatever is therein. You are the Truth, and Your saying is the Truth, and Your promise is the Truth, and the meeting with You is the Truth, and Paradise is the Truth, and the (Hell) Fire is the Truth. O Alláh! I surrender myself to You, and believe in You, and I put my trust in You (solely depend upon). And to You I complain of my opponents and with Your Evidence I argue. So please forgive the sins which I have done in the past or I will do in the future, and also those (sins) which I did in secret or in public, and that which You know better than I. None has the right to be worshipped but You."

To such a man Alláh will say on the Day of Resurrection, 'Today I withhold My Blessings from you as you withheld the superfluous part of that (water) which your hands did not create.'"

Narrated by Abu Bakra {#9:539 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Time has come back to its original state which it had when Alláh created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are in succession, namely, Dhul-Qa'da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha'ban." The Prophet then asked us, "Which month is this?" We said, "Alláh and His Apostle know (it) better." He kept quiet so long that we thought he might call it by another name. Then he said, "Isn't it Dhul-Hijja?" We said, "Yes." He asked "What town is this?" We said, "Alláh and His Apostle know (it) better.' Then he kept quiet so long that we thought he might call it by another name. He then said, "Isn't it the (forbidden) town (Mecca)?" We said, "Yes." He asked, "What is the day today?" We said, "Alláh and His Apostle know (it) better. Then he kept quiet so long that we thought that he might call it by another name. Then he said, "Isn't it the Day of An-Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifices)?" We said, "Yes." Then he said, "Your blood (lives), your properties," (the sub narrator Muḥammad, said: I think he also said): "..and your honor) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this Day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours. You shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Don't go astray after me by striking the necks of one another. Lo! It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the informed one might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present audience." Whenever the sub-narrator Muḥammad mentioned that statement, he would say, "The Prophet said the truth.") And then the Prophet added, "No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Alláh's Message to you! No doubt! Haven't I conveyed Alláh's Message to you?"

A son of one of the daughters of the Prophet was dying, so she sent a person to call the Prophet. He sent (her a message), "What ever Alláh takes is for Him, and whatever He gives is for Him, and everything has a limited fixed term (in this world) so she should be patient and hope for Alláh's reward." She then sent for him again, swearing that he should come. Alláh's Apostle got up, and so did Mu'adh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka'b and 'Ubada bin As-Samit. When he entered (the house), they gave the child to Alláh's Apostle while its breath was disturbed in his chest. (The sub-narrator said: I think he said, "...as if it was a water skin.") Alláh's Apostle started weeping whereupon Sa'd bin 'Ubada said, "Do you weep?" The Prophet said, "Alláh is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others)."

So Alláh said to Paradise, 'You are My Mercy,' and said to Hell, 'You are My Punishment which I inflict upon whom I wish, and I shall fill both of you.'" The Prophet added, "As for Paradise, (it will be filled with good people) because Alláh does not wrong any of His created things, and He creates for Hell (Fire) whomever He will, and they will be thrown into it, and it will say thrice, 'Is there any more, till Alláh (will put) His Foot over it and it will become full and its sides will come close to each other and it will say, 'Qat!

Then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period (40 days) and then he becomes like a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then an angel is sent to him (by Alláh) and the angel is allowed (ordered) to write four things; his livelihood, his (date of) death, his deeds, and whether he will be a wretched one or a blessed one (in the Hereafter) and then the soul is breathed into him. So one of you may do (good) deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise so much that there is nothing except a cubit between him and Paradise but then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) and (ultimately) enters Hell (Fire); and one of you may do (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) so much so that there is nothing except a cubit between him and Hell (Fire), then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (good) deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and ultimately) enters Paradise."

But they asked him and he stood leaning on the stick and I was standing behind him and I thought that he was being divinely inspired. Then he said, "They ask you concerning the spirit say: The spirit, its knowledge is with My Lord. And of knowledge you (O men!) have been given only a little."...

The Prophet stood before Musailama (the liar) who was sitting with his companions then, and said to him, "If you ask me for this piece (of palm-leaf stalk), even then I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid what Alláh has ordained for you, and if you turn away from Islam, Alláh will surely ruin you!"

Narrated by Ibn Mas'ud {#9:554 .italic}

While I was walking in company with the Prophet in one of the fields of Medina, the Prophet was reclining on a palm leave stalk which he carried with him. We passed by a group of Jews. Some of them said to the others, "Ask him about the spirit." The others said, "Do not ask him, lest he would say something that you hate." Some of them said, "We will ask him." So a man from among them stood up and said, 'O Abal-Qasim! What is the spirit?" The Prophet kept quiet and I knew that he was being divinely inspired. Then he said: "They ask you concerning the Spirit, Say: The Spirit; its knowledge is with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a little." (17.85)

Narrated by Anas {#9:556 .italic}

Then I heard him on leaving while he was striking his thighs, saying, 'But man is, more quarrelsome than anything.' (18.54)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:558 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The example of a believer is that of a fresh green plant the leaves of which move in whatever direction the wind forces them to move and when the wind becomes still, it stand straight. Such is the similitude of the believer: He is disturbed by calamities (but is like the fresh plant he regains his normal state soon). And the example of a disbeliever is that of a pine tree (which remains) hard and straight till Alláh cuts it down when He will." (See Ḥadít_h No. 546 and 547, Vol. 7).

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Umar {#9:559 .italic}

I heard Alláh's Apostle while he was standing on the pulpit, saying, "The remaining period of your stay (on the earth) in comparison to the nations before you, is like the period between the 'Asr prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted upon it till midday, and then they were worn out and were given for their labor, one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the 'Asr prayer, and then they were worn out and were given (for their labor), one Qirat each. Then you people were given the Qur’án and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two Qirats each (double the reward of the previous nations)." Then the people of the Torah said, 'O our Lord! These people have done a little labor (much less than we) but have taken a greater reward.' Alláh said, 'Have I withheld anything from your reward?' They said, 'No.' Then Alláh said, 'That is My Favor which I bestow on whom I wish.' "

Narrated by 'Ubada bin As-Samit {#9:560 .italic}

I, along with a group of people, gave the pledge of allegiance to Alláh's Apostle.

Whoever among you will abide by his pledge, his reward will be with Alláh, and whoever commits any of those sins and receives the punishment in this world, that punishment will be an expiation for his sins and purification; but if Alláh screens him, then it will be up to Alláh to punish him if He will or excuse Him, if He will."

So he slept with his wives and none of them (conceived and) delivered (a child) except one who brought a half (body) boy (deformed). Alláh's Prophet said, "If Solomon had said; 'If Alláh Will,' then each of those women would have delivered a (would-be) cavalier to fight in Alláh's Cause." (See Ḥadít_h No. 74 A, Vol. 4).

The Jew said, "By Him Who gave superiority to Moses over all the people!' On that the Muslim lifted his hand and slapped the Jew. The Jew went to Alláh's Apostle and informed him of all that had happened between him and the Muslim. The Prophet said, "Do not give me superiority over Moses, for the people will fall unconscious on the Day of Resurrection, I will be the first to regain consciousness and behold, Moses will be standing there, holding the side of the Throne. I will not know whether he has been one of those who have fallen unconscious and then regained consciousness before me, or if he has been one of those exempted by Alláh (from falling unconscious)."

I drew from it as much water as Alláh wished me to draw, and then Ibn Quhafa (Abu Bakr) took the bucket from me and drew one or two buckets, and there was weakness in his drawing... may Alláh forgive him! Then ‘Umar took the bucket which turned into something like a big drum. I had never seen a powerful man among the people working as perfectly and vigorously as he did.

Did you hear Alláh's Apostle mentioning anything about him?" Ubai said, "Yes, I heard Alláh's Apostle saying, "While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites a man came to him and asked, 'Do you know Someone who is more learned than you (Moses)?' Moses said, 'No.' So Alláh sent the Divine inspiration to Moses: 'Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you' Moses asked Alláh how to meet him ( Khadir) So Alláh made the fish as a sign for him and it was said to him, 'When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where you lose it) and you will meet him.' So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The boy servant of Moses (who was accompanying him) said to him, 'Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget to tell you (about) the fish. None but Satan made me forget to tell you about it' (18.63) Moses said: 'That is what we have been seeking." Sa they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64). So they both found Kadir (there) and then happened what Alláh mentioned about them (in the Qur’án)!' (See 18.60-82)

It seemed that statement pleased them whereupon Alláh's Apostle smiled.

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:582 .italic}

(regarding the Verse): 'Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.' (17.110) This Verse was revealed while Alláh's Apostle was hiding himself in Mecca, and when he raised his voice while reciting the Qur’án, the pagans would hear him and abuse the Qur’án and its Revealer and to the one who brought it. So Alláh said: 'Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.' (17.110) That is, 'Do not say your prayer so loudly that the pagans can hear you, nor say it in such a low tone that your companions do not hear you.' But seek a middle course between those (extremes), i.e., let your companions hear, but do not relate the Qur’án loudly, so that they may learn it from you.

And the smell of the mouth of a fasting person is better in Alláh's Sight than the smell of musk." (See Ḥadít_h No. 128, Vol. 3).

'Aisha said, "But by Alláh, I did not think that Alláh, (to confirm my innocence), would reveal Divine Inspiration which would be recited, for I consider myself too unimportant to be talked about by Alláh through Divine Inspiration revealed for recitation, but I hoped that Alláh's Apostle might have a dream in which Alláh would reveal my innocence.

But Alláh ordered the sea to collect what was in it (of his ashes) and similarly ordered the earth to collect what was in it (of his ashes). Then Alláh said (to the recreated man ), 'Why did you do so?' The man replied, 'For being afraid of You, and You know it (very well).' So Alláh forgave him."

He told them that he had not presented any good deed before Alláh, and if Alláh should get hold of him He would punish him.' "So look!" he added, "When I die, burn me, and when I turn into coal, crush me, and when there comes a windy day, scatter my ashes in the wind." The Prophet added, "Then by Alláh, he took a firm promise from his children to do so, and they did so. (They burnt him after his death) and threw his ashes on a windy day. Then Alláh commanded to his ashes. "Be," and behold! He became a man standing! Alláh said, "O My slave! What made you do what you did?" He replied, "For fear of You." Nothing saved him then but Alláh's Mercy (So Alláh forgave him).

Narrated by Ma'bad bin Hilal Al'Anzi {#9:601 .italic}

We, i.e., some people from Basra gathered and went to Anas bin Malik, and we went in company with Thabit Al-Bunnani so that he might ask him about the Ḥadít_h of Intercession on our behalf. Behold, Anas was in his palace, and our arrival coincided with his Duha prayer. We asked permission to enter and he admitted us while he was sitting on his bed. We said to Thabit, "Do not ask him about anything else first but the Ḥadít_h of Intercession." He said, "O Abu Hamza! There are your brethren from Basra coming to ask you about the Ḥadít_h of Intercession." Anas then said, "Muḥammad talked to us saying, 'On the Day of Resurrection the people will surge with each other like waves, and then they will come to Adam and say, 'Please intercede for us with your Lord.' He will say, 'I am not fit for that but you'd better go to Abraham as he is the Khalil of the Beneficent.' They will go to Abraham and he will say, 'I am not fit for that, but you'd better go to Moses as he is the one to whom Alláh spoke directly.' So they will go to Moses and he will say, 'I am not fit for that, but you'd better go to Jesus as he is a soul created by Alláh and His Word.' (Be: And it was) they will go to Jesus and he will say, 'I am not fit for that, but you'd better go to Muḥammad.' They would come to me and I would say, 'I am for that.' Then I will ask for my Lord's permission, and it will be given, and then He will inspire me to praise Him with such praises as I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those praises and will fall down, prostrate before Him. Then it will be said, 'O Muḥammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for your will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my followers! My followers!' And then it will be said, 'Go and take out of Hell (Fire) all those who have faith in their hearts, equal to the weight of a barley grain.' I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down (prostrate) before Him. Then it will be said, 'O Muḥammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my followers! My followers!' It will be said, 'Go and take out of it all those who have faith in their hearts equal to the weight of a small ant or a mustard seed.' I will go and do so and return to praise Him with the same praises, and fall down in prostration before Him. It will be said, 'O, Muḥammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.' I will say, 'O Lord, my followers!' Then He will say, 'Go and take out (all those) in whose hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the Fire.' I will go and do so."' When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions, "Let's pass by Al-Ḥasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us." So we went to him and we greeted him and he admitted us. We said to him, "O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Ḥadít_h about the intercession the like of which I have never heard." He said, "What is that?" Then we told him of the Ḥadít_h and said, "He stopped at this point (of the Ḥadít_h)." He said, "What then?" We said, "He did not add anything to that." He said, Anas related the Ḥadít_h to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don't know whether he forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said." We said, "O Abu Said ! Let us know that." He smiled and said, "Man was created hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it. Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the Prophet added, 'I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate before Him me the same as he 'O Muḥammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted .' I will say, 'O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshiped except Alláh.' Then Alláh will say, 'By my Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell (Fire) whoever said: 'None has the right to be worshipped except Alláh.'"

He will reply, 'O Lord, Paradise is full.' Alláh will give him the same order thrice, and each time the man will give Him the same reply, i.e., 'Paradise is full.' Thereupon Alláh will say (to him), 'Ten times of the world is for you.'"

Alláh's Apostle said, "There will be none among you but his Lord will talk to him, and there will be no interpreter between him and Alláh. He will look to his right and see nothing but his deeds which he has sent forward, and will look to his left and see nothing but his deeds which he has sent forward, and will look in front of him and see nothing but the (Hell) Fire facing him. So save yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (given in charity)." Al-A'mash said: 'Amr bin Murra said, Khaithama narrated the same and added, '...even with a good word.'"

A priest from the Jews came (to the Prophet) and said, "On the Day of Resurrection, Alláh will place all the heavens on one finger, and the Earth on one finger, and the waters and the land on one finger, and all the creation on one finger, and then He will shake them and say. 'I am the King! I am the King!'" I saw the Prophet smiling till his premolar teeth became visible expressing his amazement and his belief in what he had said. Then the Prophet recited: 'No just estimate have they made of Alláh such as due to Him (up to)...; High is He above the partners they attribute to Him.' (39.67)

A man asked Ibn ‘Umar, "What have you heard from Alláh's Apostle regarding An-Najwa?" He said, "Everyone of you will come close to His Lord Who will screen him from the people and say to him, 'Did you do so-and-so?' He will reply, 'Yes.' Then Alláh will say, 'Did you do so-and-so?' He will reply, 'Yes.' So Alláh will question him and make him confess, and then Alláh will say, 'I screened your sins in the world and forgive them for you today.' "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:606 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Adam and Moses debated with each other and Moses said, 'You are Adam who turned out your offspring from Paradise.' Adam said, "You are Moses whom Alláh chose for His Message and for His direct talk, yet you blame me for a matter which had been ordained for me even before my creation?' Thus Adam overcame Moses."

Narrated by Anas {#9:607 .italic}

Alláh's Apostle said, "The believers will be assembled on the Day of Resurrection and they will say, 'Let us look for someone to intercede for us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.' So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are Adam, the father of mankind, and Alláh created you with His Own Hands and ordered the Angels to prostrate before you, and He taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with our Lord so that He may relieve us.' Adam will say, to them, 'I am not fit for that,' and then he will mention to them his mistake which he has committed.' "

Narrated by Anas bin Malik {#9:608 .italic}

The night Alláh's Apostle was taken for a journey from the sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka'ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of them said, "Which of them is he?" The middle (second) angel said, "He is the best of them." The last (third) angle said, "Take the best of them." Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258, Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not--and so is the case with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zam-Zam. From among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on one of its doors. The dwellers of the Heaven asked, 'Who is it?' He said, "Gabriel." They said, "Who is accompanying you?" He said, "Muḥammad." They said, "Has he been called?" He said, "Yes" They said, "He is welcomed." So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with his arrival, and they did not know what Alláh would do to the Prophet on earth unless Alláh informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the Prophet, "He is your father; greet him." The Prophet greeted him and Adam returned his greeting and said, "Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!" Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, "What are these two rivers, O Gabriel?" Gabriel said, "These are the sources of the Nile and the Euphrates." Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, "What is this, O Gabriel?" Gabriel said, "This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for you." Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., "Who is it?" Gabriel replied, "Gabriel". They asked, "Who is accompanying you?" He said, "Muḥammad." They asked, "Has he been sent for?" He said, "Yes." Then they said, "He is welcomed.'' Then he (Gabriel) ascended with the Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first and the second Heavens had said. Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same; and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don't remember, on the fifth Heaven, Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of talking to Alláh directly. Moses said (to Alláh), "O Lord! I thought that none would be raised up above me." But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance above that, the distance of which only Alláh knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263, 264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Alláh revealed to him then, was: "Fifty prayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night." Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then Moses stopped him and asked, "O Muḥammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?" The Prophet replied," He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a night." Moses said, "Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord may reduce it for you and for them." So the Prophet turned to Gabriel as if he wanted to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, "Yes, if you wish." So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in his place, "O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that." So Alláh deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to only five prayers. Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to five and said, "O Muḥammad! By Alláh, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten your burden." The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet said, "O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so lighten our burden." On that the Irresistible said, "O Muḥammad!" the Prophet replied, "Labbaik and Sa'daik." Alláh said, "The Word that comes from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the Book." Alláh added, "Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in practice)." The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, "What have you done?" He said, "He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good deed a tenfold reward." Moses said, "By Alláh! I tried to make Bani Israel observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten your burden further." Alláh's Apostle said, "O Moses! By Alláh, I feel shy of returning too many times to my Lord." On that Gabriel said, "Descend in Alláh's Name." The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca).

Narrated by Abu Sa‘íd Al-Khudri {#9:609 .italic}

The Prophet said, "Alláh will say to the people of Paradise, "O the people of Paradise!" They will say, 'Labbaik, O our Lord, and Sa'daik, and all the good is in Your Hands!' Alláh will say, "Are you satisfied?' They will say, 'Why shouldn't we be satisfied, O our Lord as You have given us what You have not given to any of Your created beings?' He will say, 'Shall I not give you something better than that?' They will say, 'O our Lord! What else could be better than that?' He will say, 'I bestow My Pleasure on you and will never be angry with you after that.' "

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:610 .italic}

Once the Prophet was preaching while a bedouin was sitting there. The Prophet said, "A man from among the people of Paradise will request Alláh to allow him to cultivate the land Alláh will say to him, 'Haven't you got whatever you desire?' He will reply, 'yes, but I like to cultivate the land (Alláh will permit him and) he will sow the seeds, and within seconds the plants will grow and ripen and (the yield) will be harvested and piled in heaps like mountains. On that Alláh will say (to him), "Take, here you are, O son of Adam, for nothing satisfies you.' "On that the bedouin said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Such man must be either from Quraish or from Ansar, for they are farmers while we are not." On that Alláh's Apostle smiled.

Narrated by ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:611 .italic}

I asked Alláh's Apostle "What is the biggest sin in the sight of Alláh?" He said, "To set up rivals unto Alláh though He alone created you." I said, "In fact, that is a tremendous sin," and added, "What next?" He said, "To kill your son being afraid that he may share your food with you." I further asked, "What next?" He said, "To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor."

Two person of Bani Thaqif and one from Quarish (or two persons from Quraish and one from Bani Thaqif) who had fat bellies but little wisdom, met near the Ka'ba. One of them said, "Did you see that Alláh hears what we say? " The other said, "He hears us if we speak aloud, but He does not hear if we speak in stealthy quietness (softly)." The third fellow said, "If He hears when we speak aloud, then He surely hears us if we speak in stealthy quietness (softly)." So Alláh revealed the Verse: 'And you have not been screening against yourselves, lest your ears, and your eyes and your skins should testify against you..." (41.22)

Narrated by 'Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdu’lláh {#9:614 .italic}

‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás said, "O the group of Muslims! How can you ask the people of the Scriptures about anything while your Book which Alláh has revealed to your Prophet contains the most recent news from Alláh and is pure and not distorted? Alláh has told you that the people of the Scriptures have changed some of Alláh's Books and distorted it and wrote something with their own hands and said, 'This is from Alláh, so as to have a minor gain for it. Won't the knowledge that has come to you stop you from asking them? No, by Alláh, we have never seen a man from them asking you about that (the Book Al-Qur’án ) which has been revealed to you.

Narrated by Musa bin Abi 'Aisha {#9:615 .italic}

Sa‘íd bin Jubair reported from Ibn ‘Abbás (regarding the explanation of the Verse: 'Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith) . He said, "The Prophet used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.' Ibn ‘Abbás said (to Sa‘íd), "I move them (my lips) as Alláh's Apostle used to move his lips." And Said said (to me), "I move my lips as I saw Ibn ‘Abbás moving his lips," and then he moved his lips. So Alláh revealed: '(O Muḥammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the Qur’án) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muḥammad) the ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).' (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muḥammad through Gabriel) then follow you its recital.' (75.18) This means, "You should listen to it and keep quiet and then it is upon Us to make you recite it." The narrator added, "So Alláh's Apostle used to listen whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet would recite the Qur’án as Gabriel had recited it to him."

Narrated by Ibn ‘Abbás {#9:616 .italic}

Regarding the explanation of the Verse: '(O Muḥammad!) Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.' (17.110) This Verse was revealed while Alláh's Apostle was hiding himself at Mecca. At that time, when he led his companions in prayer, he used to raise his voice while reciting the Qur’án; and if the pagans heard him, they would abuse the Qur’án, its Revealer, and the one who brought it. So Alláh said to His Prophet: "Neither say your prayer aloud. i.e., your recitation (of Qur’án) lest the pagans should hear (it) and abuse the Qur’án" nor say it in a low tone, "lest your voice should fail to reach your companions, "but follow a way between." (17.110)

Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted on it till 'Asr Prayer and then they were unable to carry on, so they were given la reward equal to) one Qirat each. Then you were given the Qur’án and you acted on it till sunset, therefore you were given (a reward equal to) two Qirats each. On that, the people of the Scriptures said, 'These people (Muslims) did less work than we but they took a bigger reward.' Alláh said (to them).

Once, while we were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari, there was brought to him a meal which contained chicken meat, and there was sitting beside him, a man from the tribe of Bani Taimul-lah who looked like one of the Mawali. Abu Musa invited the man to eat but the man said, "I have seen chicken eating some dirty things, and I have taken an oath not to eat chicken." Abu Musa said to him, "Come along, let me tell you something in this regard. Once I went to the Prophet with a few men from Ash'ariyyin and we asked him for mounts. The Prophet said, By Alláh, I will not mount you on anything; besides I do not have anything to mount you on.' Then a few camels from the war booty were brought to the Prophet, and he asked about us, saying, 'Where are the group of Ash'ariyyin?' So he ordered for five fat camels to be given to us and then we set out. We said, 'What have we done? Alláh's Apostle took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride and that he had nothing for us to ride, yet he provided us with mounts. We made Alláh's Apostle forget his oath! By Alláh, we will never be successful.' So we returned to him and reminded him of his oath. He said, 'I have not provided you with the mount, but Alláh has done so. By Alláh, I may take an oath to do something, but on finding something else which is better, I do that which is better and make the expiation for my oath.'"

It is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Alláh, to offer prayers perfectly, to give Zakat, and to give Al-Khumus (one-fifth of the war booty) (in Alláh's Cause).

The Prophet said, 'The example of a believer who recites the Qur’án is that of a citron (a citrus fruit) which is good in taste and good in smell. And the believer who does not recite the Qur’án is like a date which has a good taste but no smell. And the example of an impious person who recites the Qur’án is that of Ar-Rihana (an aromatic plant) which smells good but is bitter in taste. And the example of an impious person who does not recite the Qur’án is that of a colocynth which is bitter in taste and has no smell."

Some people asked the Prophet regarding the soothsayers. He said, "They are nothing." They said, "O Alláh's Apostle! Some of their talks come true." The Prophet said, "That word which happens to be true is what a Jinn snatches away by stealth (from the Heaven) and pours it in the ears of his friend (the foreteller) with a sound like the cackling of a hen. The soothsayers then mix with that word, one hundred lies."

The Prophet said, "There will emerge from the East some people who will recite the Qur’án but it will not exceed their throats and who will go out of (renounce) the religion (Islam) as an arrow passes through the game, and they will never come back to it unless the arrow, comes back to the middle of the bow (by itself) (i.e., impossible). The people asked, "What will their signs be?" He said, "Their sign will be the habit of shaving (of their beards). (Fateh Al-Bari, Page 322, Vol. 17th)

Narrated by Abu Huraira {#9:652 .italic}

The Prophet said, "(There are) two words which are dear to the Beneficent (Alláh) and very light (easy) for the tongue (to say), but very heavy in weight in the balance. They are: 'Subhan Alláh wa-bi hamdihi' and 'Subhan Alláh Al-'Azim." (See Ḥadít_h No. 673, Vol. 8).
