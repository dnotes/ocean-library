## HYMN I. Agni.

THOU, first inventor of this prayer, O Agni, Worker of Marvels, hast become our Herald.
Thou, Bull, hast made us strength which none may conquer, strength that shall overcome all other prowess. {#1:1}

As Priest thou sattest at the seat of worship, furthering us, best Offerer, meet for honour.
So first to thee have pious men resorted, turning thy mind to thoughts of ample riches. {#1:2}

In thee, still watching, they have followed riches, who goest with much wealth as with an army,
The radiant Agni, lofty, fair to look on, worshipped with marrow, evermore resplendent. {#1:3}

They who approached the God's abode with homage, eager for glory, won them perfect glory:
Yea, they gained even sacrificial titles, and found delight in thine auspicious aspect. {#1:4}

On earth the people magnify thee greatly, thee their celestial and terrestrial riches.
Thou, Helper, must be known as our Preserver, Father and Mother of mankind for ever. {#1:5}

Dear priest among mankind, adorable Agni hath seated him, joy-giver, skilled in worship.
Let us approach thee shining in thy dwelling, kneeling upon our knees, with adoration. {#1:6}

Longing for bliss, pure-minded, God-devoted, Agni, we seek thee, such, meet to be lauded.
Thou, Agni, leddest forth our men to battle, refulgent with the heaven's exalted splendour. {#1:7}

Sage of mankind, all peoples' Lord and Master, the Bull of men, the sender down of blessings,
Still pressing on, promoting, purifying, Agni the Holy One, the Lord of riches. {#1:8}

Agni, the mortal who hath toiled and worshipped, brought thee oblations with his kindled fuel,
And well knows sacrifice with adoration, gains every joy with thee to guard and help him. {#1:9}

Mightily let us worship thee the Mighty, with reverence, Agni! fuel and oblations,
With songs, O Son of Strength, with hymns, with altar: so may we strive for thine auspicious favour. {#1:10}

Thou who hast covered heaven and earth with splendour and with thy glories, glorious and triumphant.
Continue thou to shine on us, O Agni, with strength abundant, rich, and long enduring. {#1:11}

Vouchsafe us ever, as man needs, O Vasu, abundant wealth of kine for son and offspring.
Food noble, plenteous, far from sin and evil, he with us, and fair fame to make us happy. {#1:12}

May I obtain much wealth in many places by love of thee and through thy grace, King Agni;
For in thee Bounteous One, in thee the Sovran, Agni, are many boons for him who serves thee. {#1:13}

* * *

## HYMN II. Agni.

THOU, Agni, even as Mitra, hast a princely glory of thine own.
Thou, active Vasu, makest fame increase like full prosperity. {#2:1}

For, verily, men pray to thee with sacrifices and with songs.
To thee the Friendly Courser, seen of all, comes speeding through the air. {#2:2}

Of one accord men kindle thee Heaven's signal of the sacrifice,
When, craving bliss, this race of man invites thee to the solemn rite. {#2:3}

Let the man thrive who travails sore, in prayer, far thee the Bountiful.
He with the help of lofty Dyaus comes safe through straits of enmity. {#2:4}

The mortal who with fuel lights thy flame and offers unto thee,
Supports a house with many a branch, Agni, to live a hundred years. {#2:5}

Thy bright smoke lifts itself aloft, and far-extended shines in heaven.
For, Purifier! like the Sun thou beamest with thy radiant glow. {#2:6}

For in men's houses thou must be glorified as a well-loved guest,
Gay like an elder in a fort, claiming protection like a son. {#2:7}

Thou, Agni, like an able steed, art urged by wisdom in the wood.
Thou art like wind; food, home art thou, like a young horse that runs astray. {#2:8}

E’en things imperishable, thou, O Agni, like a gazing ox,
Eatest, when hosts, Eternal One! of thee the Mighty rend the woods. {#2:9}

Agni, thou enterest as Priest the home of men who sacrifice.
Lord of the people, prosper them. Accept the ofrering, Aṅgiras! {#2:10}

O Agni, God with Mitra's might, call hither the favour of the Gods from earth and heaven.
Bring weal from heaven, that men may dwell securely. May we o’ercome the foe's malign oppressions, may we o’ercome them, through thy help o’ercome them. {#2:11}

* * *

## HYMN III. Agni.

TRUE, guardian of the Law, thy faithful servant wins ample light and dwells in peace, O Agni,
Whom thou, as Varuṇa in accord with Mitra, guardest, O God, by banishing his trouble. {#3:1}

He hath paid sacrifices, toiled in worship, and offered gifts to wealth-increasing Agni.
Him the displeasure of the famous moves not, outrage and scorn affect not such a mortal. {#3:2}

Bright God, whose look is free from stain like Sūrya's, thou, swift, what time thou earnestly desirest,
Hast gear to give us. Come with joy at evening, where, Child of Wood, thou mayest also tarry. {#3:3}

Fierce is his gait and vast his wondrous body: he champeth like a horse with bit and bridle,
And, darting forth his tongue, as ’twere a hatchet, burning the woods, smelteth them like a smelter. {#3:4}

Archer-like, fain toshoot, he sets his arrow, and whets his splendour like the edge of iron:
The messenger of night with brilliant pathway, like a tree-roosting bird of rapid pinion. {#3:5}

In beams of morn he clothes him like the singer, and bright as Mitra with his splendour crackles.
Red in the night, by day the men's possession: red, he belongs to men by day, Immortal. {#3:6}

Like Heaven's when scattering beams his voice was uttered: among the plants the radiant Hero shouted,
Who with his glow in rapid course came hither to fill both worlds, well-wedded Dames, with treasure. {#3:7}

Who, with supporting streams and rays that suit him, hath flashed like lightning with his native vigour.
Like the deft Maker of the band of Maruts, the bright impetuous One hath shone refulgent. {#3:8}

* * *

## HYMN IV Agni.

As at man's service of the Gods, Invoker, thou, Son of Strength, dost sacrifice and worship,
So bring for us to-day all Gods together, bring willingly the willing Gods, O Agni. {#4:1}

May Agni, radiant Herald of the morning, meet to be known, accept our praise with favour.
Dear to all life, mid mortal men Immortal, our guest, awake at dawn, is Jātavedas. {#4:2}

Whose might the very heavens regard with wonder: bright as the Sun he clothes himself with lustre.
He who sends forth,, Eternal Purifier, hath shattered e’en the ancient works of Aśna. {#4:3}

Thou art a Singer, Son! our feast-companion: Agni at birth prepared his food and pathway.
Therefore vouchsafe us strength, O Strength-bestower. Win like a King: foes trouble not thy dwelling. {#4:4}

Even he who cats his firm hard food with swiftness,and overtakes the nights as Vāyu kingdoms.
May we o’ercome those who resist thine orders, like a steed casting down the flying foemen. {#4:5}

Like Sūrya with his fulgent rays, O Agni, thou overspreadest both the worlds with splendour.
Decked with bright colour he dispels the darkness, like Auśija, with clear flame swifily flying. {#4:6}

We have elected thee as most delightful for thy beams' glow: hear our great laud, O Agni.
The best men praise thee as the peer of Indra in strength, mid Gods, like Viyu in thy bounty. {#4:7}

Now, Agni, on the tranquil paths of riches come to us for our weal: save us from sorrow.
Grant chiefs and bard this boon. May we live happy, with hero children, through a hundred winters. {#4:8}

## HYMN V. Agni.

I INVOCATE your Son of Strength, the Youthful, with hymns, the Youngest God, whose speech is guileless;
Sage who sends wealth comprising every treasure, bringer of many boons, devoid of malice. {#5:1}

At eve and morn thy pious servants bring thee their precious gifts, O Priest of many aspects,
On whom, the Purifier, all things living as on firm. ground their happiness have stablished. {#5:2}

Thou from of old hast dwelt among these people, by mental power the charioteer of blessings.
Hence sendest thou, O sapient Jātavedas, to him who serves thee treasures in succession. {#5:3}

Agni, whoever secretly attacks us, the neighbour, thou with Mitra's might! who harms us,
Burn him with thine own Steers for ever youthful, burning with burning heat, thou fiercest burner. {#5:4}

He who serves thee with sacrifice and fuel, with hymn, O Son of Strength, and chanted praises,
Shines out, Immortal! in the midst of mortals, a sage, with wealth, with splendour and with glory. {#5:5}

Do this, O Agni, when we urge thee, quickly, triumphant in thy might subdue our foemen.
When thou art praised with words and decked with brightness, accept this chanted hymn, the singer's worship. {#5:6}

Help us, that we may gain this wish, O Agni, gain riches, Wealthy One! with store of heroes.
Desiring strength from thee may we be strengthened, and win, Eternal! thine eternal glory. {#5:7}

* * *

## HYMN VI. Agni.

HE who seeks furtherance and grace to help him goes to the Son of Strength with newest worship,
Calling the heavenly Priest to share the banquet, who rends the wood, bright, with his blackened pathway. {#6:1}

White-hued and thundering he dwells in splendour, Most Youthful, with the loudvoiced and eternal-
Agni, most variform, the Purifier, who follows crunching many ample forests. {#6:2}

Incited by the wind thy flames, O Agni, move onward, Pure One! pure, in all directions.
Thy most destructive heavenly Navagvas break the woods down and devastate them boldly. {#6:3}

Thy pure white horses from their bonds are loosened: O Radiant One, they shear the ground beneath them,
And far and wide shines out thy flame, and flickers rapidly moving over earth's high ridges. {#6:4}

Forth darts the Bull's tongue like the sharp stone weapon discharged by him who fights to win the cattle.
Agni's fierce flame is like a hero's onset: dread and resistless he destroys the forests. {#6:5}

Thou with the sunlight of the great Impeller hast boldly over-spread the earth's expanses.
So drive away with conquering might all perils. fighting out foemen burn up those who harm us. {#6:6}

Wondrous! of wondrous power! give to the singer wealth wondrous, marked, most wonderful, life-giving.
Wealth bright, O Bright One, vast, with many heroes, give with thy bright flames to the man who lauds thee. {#6:7}

* * *

Him, messenger of earth and head of heaven, Agni Vaiśvānara, born in holy Order,
The Sage, the King, the guest of men, a vessel fit for their mouths, the Gods have generated. {#7:1}

Him have they praised, mid-point of sacrifices, great cistern of libations, seat of riches.
Vaiśvānara, conveyer of oblations, ensign of worship, have the Gods engendered. {#7:2}

AT Jātavedas' holy gathering I will tell aloud the conquering might of the swift red-hued Steer.
A pure and fresher hymn flows to Vaiśvānara, even as for Agni lovely Soma is made pure. {#8:1}

That Agni, when in loftiest heaven he sprang to life, Guardian of Holy Laws, kept and observed them well.
Exceeding wise, he measured out the firmament. Vaiśvānara attained to heaven by mightiness. {#8:2}

Found in three places, like the Speeder's footstep, come to present men's riches as oblations! {#12:2}

He knows himself, like as a guileless smelter, not to be stayed among the plants, Immortal. {#12:3}

Each time he comes from heaven, the Pure One from of old: from ancient days the Child cats everlasting food. {#15:1}

As such, most friendly, thou art every day extolled in lauds by Vitahavya, O thou wondrous God. {#15:2}

Be thou the foeless helper of the skilful man, subduer of the enemy near or far away.
Bestow a wealthy home on men, O Son of Strength. Give Vitahavya riches spreading far and wide, give Bharadvāja wide-spread wealth. {#15:3}

The end of sacrifice or its inception; yea, thou endowest him with power and riches. {#15:11}

Drive from us with thy tongue, O God, the man who doeth evil deeds,
The mortal who would strike us dead. {#16:32}

Give shelter reaching far and wide to Bharadvāja, conquering Lord!
Agni, send wealth most excellent. {#16:33}

May Agni slay the Vṛtras,—fain for riches, through the lord of song,
Served with oblation, kindled, bright. {#16:34}

His Father's Father, shining in his Mother's everlasting side,
Set on the seat of holy Law. {#16:35}

O active Jātavedas, bring devotion that wins progeny, Agni, that it may shine to heaven. {#16:36}

O Child of Strength, to thee whose look is lovely we with dainty food,
O Agni, have poured forth our songs. {#16:37}

To thee for shelter are we come, as to the shade from fervent heat
Agni, who glitterest like gold. {#16:38}

Mighty as one who slays with shafts, or like a bull with sharpened horn,
Agni, thou breakest down the forts. {#16:39}

Whom, like an infant newly born, devourer, in their arms they bear,
Men's Agni, skilled in holy rites. {#16:40}

Bear to the banquet of the Gods the God best finder-out of wealth,
Let him he seated in his place. {#16:41}

In Jātavedas kindle ye the dear guest who hath now appeared
In a soft place, the homestead's Lord. {#16:42}

Harness, O Agni, O thou God, thy steeds which are most excellent:
They bear thee as thy spirit wills. {#16:43}

Come hither, bring the Gods to us to taste the sacrificial feast,
To drink the draught of Soma juice. {#16:44}

O Agni of the Bharatas, blaze high with everlasting might,
Shine forth and gleam, Eternal One. {#16:45}

The mortal man who serves the God with banquet, and, bringing gifts at sacrifice, lauds Agni,
May well attract, with prayer and hands uplifted, the Priest of Heaven and Earth, true Sacrificer. {#16:46}

Agni, we bring thee, with our hymn, oblation fashioned in the heart.
Let these be oxen unto thee, let these be bulls and kine to thee. {#16:47}

The Gods enkindle Agni, best slayer of Vṛtra, first in rank,
The Mighty, One who brings us wealth and crushes down the Rākṣasas. {#16:48}

## HYMN XVII. Indra.

DRINK Soma, Mighty One, for which, when lauded, thou breakest through the cattle-stall, O Indra;
Thou who, O Bold One, armed with thunder smotest Vṛtra with might, and every hostile being. {#17:1}

Drink it thou God who art impetuous victor, Lord of our hymns, with beauteousjaws, the Hero,
Render of kine-stalls, car-borne, thunder-wielding, so pierce thy way to wondrous strength, O Indra. {#17:2}

Drink as of old, and let the draught delight thee. hear thou our prayer and let our songs exalt thee.
Make the Sun visible, make food abundant, slaughter the foes, pierce through and free the cattle. {#17:3}

These gladdening drops, O Indra, Self-sustainer, quaffed shall augment thee in thy mighty splendour.
Yea, let the cheering drops delight thee greatly, great, perfect, strong, powerful, all-subduing. {#17:4}

Gladdened whereby, bursting the firm enclosures, thou gavest splendour to the Sun and Morning.
The mighty rock that compassed in the cattle, ne’er moved, thou shookest from its seat, O Indra. {#17:5}

Thou with thy wisdom, power, and works of wonder, hast stored the ripe milk in the raw cows' udders
Unbarred the firm doors for the kine of Morning, and, with the Aṅgirases, set free the cattle. {#17:6}

Thou hast spread out wide earth, a mighty marvel, and, high thyself, propped lofty heaven, O Indra.
Both worlds, whose Sons are Gods, thou hast supported, young, Mothers from old time ofholy Order. {#17:7}

Yea, Indra, all the Deities installed thee their one strong Champion in the van for battle.
What time the godless was the Gods’ assailant, Indra they chose to win the light of heaven. {#17:8}

Yea, e’en that heaven itself of old bent backward before thy bolt, in terror of its anger,
When Indra, life of every living creature, smote down within his lair the assailing Dragon. {#17:9}

Yea, Strong One! Tvaṣṭar turned for thee, the Mighty, the bolt with thousand spikes and hundred edges,
Eager and prompt at will, wherewith thou crushedst the boasting Dragon, O impetuous Hero. {#17:10}

He dressed a hundred buffaloes, O Indra, for thee whom all accordant Maruts strengthen.
He, Pūṣan Viṣṇu, poured forth three great vessels to him, the juice that cheers, that slaughters Vṛtra. {#17:11}

Thou settest free the rushing wave of waters, the floods' great swell encompassed and obstructed.
Along steep slopes their course thou tumedst, Indra, directed downward, speeding to the ocean. {#17:12}

So may our new prayer bring thee to protect us, thee well-armed Hero with thy bolt of thunder,
Indra, who made these worlds, the Strong, the ty, who never groweth old, the victory-giver. {#17:13}

So, Indra, form us brilliant holy singers for strength, for glory, and for food and riches.
Give Bharadvāja hero patrons, Indra Indra, be ours upon the day of trial. {#17:14}

With this may we obtain strength God-appointed, and brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters. {#17:15}

## HYMN XVIII. Indra.

Magnify with these songs the never-vanquished, the Strong, the Bull of men, the Mighty Victor. {#18:1}

He, Champion, Hero, Warrior, Lord of battles, impetuous, loudly roaring, great destroyer,
Who whirls the dust on high, alone, oerthrower, hath made all races of mankind his subjects. {#18:2}

Thou, thou alone, hast tamed the Dasyus; singly thou hast subdued the people for the Ārya.
In this, or is it not, thine hero exploit, Indra? Declare it at the proper season. {#18:3}

Strong, of the strong, Most Mighty, of the mighty, thine, driver of the churl to acts of bounty. {#18:4}

Be this our ancient bond of friendship with you and with Aṅgirases here who speak of Vala.
Thou, Wondrous, Shaker of things firm, didst smite him in his fresh strength, and force his doors and castles. {#18:5}

With holy thoughts must he be called, the Mighty, showing his power in the great fight with Vṛtra.
He must be called to give us seed and offspring, the Thunderer must he moved and sped to battle. {#18:6}

He in his might, with name that lives for ever, hath far surpassed all human generations.
He, most heroic, hath his home with splendour, with glory and with riches and with valour. {#18:7}

Stranger to guile, who ne’er was false or faithless, bearing a name that may be well remembered,
Indra crushed Cumuri, Dhuni, Śambara, Pipru, and Śuṣṇa, that their castles fell in ruin. {#18:8}

With saving might that must be praised and lauded, Indra, ascend thy car to smite down Vṛtra.
In thy right hand hold fast thy bolt of thunder, and weaken, Bounteous Lord, his art and magic. {#18:9}

As Agni, as the dart burns the dry forest, like the dread shaft burn down the fiends, O Indra;
Thou who with high deep-reaching spear hast broken, hast covered over mischief and destroyed it. {#18:10}

Come, Son of Strength, o’er whom, Invoked of many! the godless hath no power to keep thee distant. {#18:11}

No foe hath he, no counterpart, no refuge is there from him the Conqueror full of wisdom {#18:12}

This day the deed that thou hast done is famous, when thou, for him, with many thousand others
Laidest low Kutsa, Āyu, Atithigva, and boldly didst deliver Tūrvayāṇa. {#18:13}

In thee, O God, the wisest of the Sages, all Gods were joyful when thou slewest Ahi.
When lauded for thyself, thou gavest freedom to sore-afflicted Heaven and to the people. {#18:14}

This power of thine both heaven and earth acknowledge, the deathless Gods acknowledge it, O Indra.
Do what thou ne’er hast done, O Mighty Worker: beget a new hymn at thy sacrifices. {#18:15}

Him who hath waxed by strength which none may conquer, and even at once grown to complete perfection. {#19:2}

Like as the household herdsman guards the cattle, so move thou round about us in the combat. {#19:3}

Free from all blame, without reproach, uninjured, e’en as were those who sang, of old, his praises. {#19:4}

In him unite all paths that lead to riches, like rivers that commingle with the ocean. {#19:5}

All splendid vigorous powers of men vouchsafe us, Lord of Bay Steeds, that they may make us joyful. {#19:6}

Wherewith by thee assisted and triumphant, we may laud thee in gaining seed and offspring. {#19:7}

Indra, bestow on us the power heroic skilled and exceeding strong, that wins the booty,
Wherewith, by thine assistance, we may conquer our foes in battle, be they kin or stranger. {#19:8}

Let thine heroic strength come from behind us, before us, from above us or below us.
From every side may it approach us, Indra. Give us the glory of the realm of splendour. {#19:9}

With most heroic aid from thee, like heroes Indra, may we win wealth by deeds glory.
Thou, King, art Lord of earthly, heavenly treasure: vouchsafe us riches vast, sublime, and lasting. {#19:10}

The Bull, whose strength hath waxed, whom Maruts follow, free-giving Indra, the Celestial Ruler,
Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us new protection. {#19:11}

Therefore upon the earth do we invoke thee, where heroes win, for sons and kine and waters. {#19:12}

GIVE us wealth, Indra, that with might, as heaven o’ertops the earth, o’ercomes our foes in battle
Wealth that brings thousands and that wins the corn-lands, wealth, Son of Strength! that vanquishes the foeman. {#20:1}

Even as the power of Dyaus, to thee, O Indra, all Asura sway was by the Gods entrusted,
When thou, Impetuous! leagued with Viṣṇu, slewest Vṛtra the Dragon who enclosed the waters. {#20:2}

Indra, Strong, Victor, Mightier than the mighty, addressed with prayer and perfect in his splendour,
Lord of the bolt that breaketh forts in pieces, became the King of the sweet juice of Soma.. {#20:3}

There, Indra, while the light was won, the Paṇis f1ed, 'neath a hundred blows, for wise Dasoni,
And greedy Śuṣṇa's magical devices nor left he any of their food remaining. {#20:4}

What time the thunder fell and Śuṣṇa perished, all life's support from the great Druh was taken.
Indra made room for his car-drivcr Kutsa who sate beside him, when he gained the sunlight. {#20:5}

As the Hawk rent for him the stalk that gladdens, he wrenched the head from Namuci the Dāsa.
He guarded Nam, Sayya's son, in slumber, and sated him with food, success, and riches. {#20:6}

Thou, thunder-armed, with thy great might hast shattered Pipru's strong forts who knew the wiles of serpents.
Thou gavest to thy worshipper Ṛjiśvan imperishable Wealth, O Bounteous Giver. {#20:7}

The crafty Vetasu, the swift Dasni, and Tugra speedily with all his servants,
Hath Indra, gladdening with strong assistance, forced near as ’twere to glorify the Mother. {#20:8}

Resistless, with the hosts he battles, bearing in both his arms the Vṛtra-slaying thunder.
He mounts his Bays, as the car-seat an archer: yoked at a word they bear the lofty Indra. {#20:9}

May we, O Indra, gain by thy new favour: so Parus laud thee, with their sacrifices,
That thou hast wrecked seven autumn forts, their shelter, slain Dāsa tribes and aided Purukutsa. {#20:10}

Favouring Uśanā the son of Kavi, thou wast his ancient strengthener, O Indra.
Thou gavest Navavāstva. as a present, to the great father gavest back his grandson. {#20:11}

Thou, roaring Indra, drovest on the waters that made a roaring sound like rushing rivers,
What time, O Hero, o’er the sea thou broughtest, in safety broughtest Turvaśa and Yadu. {#20:12}

This Indra, was thy work in war: thou sentest Dhuni and Cumuri to sleep and slumber.
Dabhīti lit the flame for thee, and worshipped with fuel, hymns, poured Soma, dressed oblations. {#20:13}

Hymns call anew the chariot-borne, Eternal: by eloquence men gain abundant riches. {#21:1}

I praise that Indra, known to all men, honoured with songs, extolled with hymns at sacrifices,
Whose majesty, rich in wondrous arts, surpasseth the magnitude of earth, and heaven in greatness. {#21:2}

Mortals who yearn to worship ne’er dishonour, O Mighty God, thy Law who art Immortal. {#21:3}

And he who did these things, where is that Indra? among what tribes? what people doth he visit?
What sacrifice contents thy mind , and wishes? What priest among them all? what hymn, O Indra? {#21:4}

Yea, here were they who, born of old, have served thee, thy friends of ancient time, thou active Worker.
Bethink thee now of these, Invoked of many! the midmost and the recent, and the youngest. {#21:5}

Inquiring after him, thy later servants, Indra, have gained thy former old traditions.
Hero, to whom the prayer is brought, we praise thee as great for that wherein we know thee mighty. {#21:6}

The demon's strength is gathered fast against thee: great as that strength hath grown, go forth to meet it.
With thine own ancient friend and companion, the thunderbolt, brave Champion! drive it backward. {#21:7}

Hear, too, the prayer of this thy present beadsman, O Indra, Hero, cherishing the singer.
For thou wast aye our fathers' Friend aforetime, still swift to listen to their supplication. {#21:8}

Bring to our help this day, for our protection, Varuṇa, Mitra , Indra, and the Maruts,
Pūṣan and Viṣṇu, Agni and Purandhi, Savitar also, and the Plants and Mountains. {#21:9}

The singers here exalt with hymns and praises thee who art very Mighty and Most Holy.
Hear, when invoked, the invoker's invocation. Beside thee there is nonelike thee, Immortal! {#21:10}

Now to my words come quickly thou who knowest, O Son of Strength, with all who claim our worship,
Who visit sacred rites, whose tongue is Agni, Gods who made Manu stronger than the Dasyu. {#21:11}

Dwelling on heights, swift, smiting down opponents, guileless in word, and in his thoughts most mighty. {#22:2}

We seek that Indra to obtain his riches that bring much food, and men, and store of heroes.
Bring us, Lord of Bay Steeds, to make us joyful, celestial wealth, abundant, undecaying. {#22:3}

Tell thou us this, if at thy hand aforetime the earlier singers have obtained good fortune,
What is thy share and portion, Strong Subduer, Asura-slayer, rich, invoked of many? {#22:4}

He who for car-borne Indra, armed with thunder, hath a hymn, craving, deeply-piercing, fluent,
Who sends a song effectual, firmly-grasping, and strength-bestowing, he comes near the mighty. {#22:5}

Strong of thyself, thou by this art hast shattered, with thought-swift Parvata, him who waxed against thee,
And, Mightiest! roaring! boldly rent in pieces things that were firmly fixed and never shaken. {#22:6}

Him will we fit for you with new devotion, the strongest Ancient One, in ancient manner.
So may that Indra, boundless, faithful Leader, conduct us o’er all places hard to traverse. {#22:7}

Thou for the people who oppress hast kindled the earthly firmament and that of heaven.
With heat, O Bull, on every side consume them: heat earth and flood for him who hates devotion. {#22:8}

Of all the Heavenly Folk, of earthly creatures thou art the King, O God of splendid aspect.
In thy right hand, O Indra, grasp die thunder: Eternal! thou destroyest all enchantments. {#22:9}

Or when with yoked Bays, Maghavan, thou comest, O Indra, bearing in thine arms the thunder. {#23:1}

Or when on that decisive day thou holpest the presser of the juice at Vṛtra's slaughter;
Or when thou, while the strong one feared, undaunted, gavest to death, Indra, the daring Dasyus. {#23:2}

Let Indra drink the pressed-out Soma, Helper and mighty Guide of him who sings his praises.
He gives the hero room who pours oblations, and treasure even to the lowly singer. {#23:3}

E’en humble rites with his Bay steeds he visits: he wields the bolt, drinks Soma, gives us cattle.
He makes the valiant rich in store of heroes, accepts our praise and hears the singer's calling. {#23:4}

What he hath longed for we have brought to Indra, who from the days of old hath done us service.
While Soma flows we will sing hymn, and laud him, so that our prayer may streng. then Indra's vigour. {#23:5}

Thou hast made prayer the means of thine exalting, therefore we wait on thee with hymns, O Indra.
May we, by the pressed Soma, Somadrinker! bring thee, with sacrifice, blissful sweet refreshment. {#23:6}

Here on the sacrificer's grass be seated: give ample room to thy devoted servant. {#23:7}

O Mighty One, be joyful as thou willest. Let these our sacrifices reach and find thee;
And may this hymn and these our invocations turn thee, whom many men invoke, to help us. {#23:8}

Friends, when thejuices flow, replenish duly your own, your bounteous Indra with the Soma.
Will it not aid him to support us? Indra. spares him who sheds the juice to win his favour. {#23:9}

While Soma flowed, thus Indra hath been lauded, Ruler of nobles, mid the Bharadvājas,
That Indra may become the singer's patron and give him wealth in every kind of treasure. {#23:10}

Excellent, Praise of Men, the bard's Supporter, Strong, he gives strength, extolled in holy synod. {#24:2}

The lofty axle of thy wheels, O Hero, is not surpassed by heaven and earth in greatness.
Like branches of a tree, Invoked of many manifold aids spring forth from thee, O Indra. {#24:3}

Strong Lord, thine energies, endowed with vigour, are like the paths of kine converging homeward.
Like bonds of cord, Indra, that bind the younglings, no bonds are they, O thou of boundless bounty. {#24:4}

One act to-day, another act tomorrow oft Indra makes what is not yet existeni.
Here have we Mitra, Varuṇa, and Pūṣan to overcome the foeman's domination. {#24:5}

By song and sacrifice men brought the waters from thee, as from a mountain's ridge, O Indra.
Urging thy might, with these fair lauds they seek thee, O theme of song, as horses rush tobattle. {#24:6}

Still may his body Wax, e’en now so mighty, glorified by the lauds and hymns that praise him. {#24:7}

Extolled, he bends not to the strong, the steadfast, nor to the bold incited by the Dasyu.
High mountains are as level plains to Indra: even in the deep he finds firm ground to rest on. {#24:8}

Impetuous Speeder through all depth and distance, give strengthening food, thou drinker of the juices.
Stand up erect to help us, unreluctant, what time the gloom of night brightens to morning. {#24:9}

Hasting to help, come hither and protect him, keep him from harm when he is here, O Indra.
At home, abroad, from injury preserve him. May brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters. {#24:10}

With these discomfit hosts that fight against us, and check the opponent's wrath, thyself uninjured.
With these chase all our foes to every quarter: subdue the tribes of Dāsas to the Ārya. {#25:2}

Those who array themselves as foes to smite us, O Indra, be they kin or be they strangers,—
Strike thou their manly strength that it be feeble, and drive in headlong flight our foemen backward. {#25:3}

With strength of limb the hero slays the hero, when bright in arms they range them for the combat.
When two opposing hosts contend in battle for seed and offspring, waters, kine, or corn-lands. {#25:4}

Yet no strong man hath conquered thee, no hero, no brave, no warrior trusting in his valour.
Not one of these is match for thee, O Indra. Thou far surpassest all these living creatures. {#25:5}

He is the Lord of both these armies' valour when the commanders call them to the conflict:
When with their ranks expanded they are fighting with a great foe or for a home with heroes. {#25:6}

And when the people stir themselves for battle, be thou their saviour, Indra, and protector,
And theirs, thy manliest of our friends, the pious, the chiefs who have installed us priests, O Indra. {#25:7}

To thee for high dominion hath been for evermore, for slaughtering the Vṛtras,
All lordly power and might, O Holy Indra, given by Gods for victory in battle. {#25:8}

To thee, the brave man's Lord, the fiends' subduer, he looks when fighting hand to hand for cattle. {#26:2}

Thou didst impel the sage to win the daylight, didst ruin Śuṣṇa for the pious Kutsa.
The invulnerable demon's head thou clavest when thou wouldst win the praise of Atithigva. {#26:3}

The lofty battle-car thou broughtest forward; thou holpest Dasadyu the strong when fighting.
Along with Vetasu thou slewest Tugra, and madest Tuji strong, who praised thee, Indra. {#26:4}

Thou madest good the laud, what time thou rentest a hundred thousand fighting foes, O Hero,
Slewest the Dāsa Śambara of the mountain, and with strange aids didst succour Divodāsa. {#26:5}

Made glad with Soma-draughts and faith, thou sentest Cumuri to his sleep, to please Dabhīti.
Thou, kindly giving Raji to Pithinas, slewest with might, at once, the sixty thousand. {#26:6}

When, Mightiest! Hero-girt! Nahuṣa heroes boast them in thee, the triply-strong Defender. {#26:7}

What joys have men of ancient times or recent obtained within the chamber of libation? {#27:1}

In its wild joy Indra hath proved him faithful, faithful in quaffing, faithful in its friendship.
His truth is the delight that in this chamber the men of old and recent times have tasted. {#27:2}

All thy vast power, O Maghavan, we know not, know not the riches of thy full abundance.
No one hath seen that might of thine, productive of bounty every day renewed, O Indra. {#27:3}

This one great power of thine our eyes have witnessed, wherewith thou slewest Varasikha's children,
When by the force of thy descending thunder, at the mere solund, their boldest was demolished. {#27:4}

In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha.
At Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frighted. {#27:5}

Three thousand, mailed, in quest of fame, together, on the Yavyavati, O much-sought Indra,
Vrcivan's sons, falling before the arrow, like bursting vessels went to their destruction. {#27:6}

He, whose two red Steers, seeking goodly pasture, plying their tongues move on 'twixt earth and heaven,
Gave Turvaśa to Sṛñjaya, and, to aid him, gave the Vrcivans up to Daivavata. {#27:7}

Two wagon-teams, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhydvartin Cayamdna,
The liberal Sovran, giveth me. This guerdon of Prthu's seed is hard to win from others. {#27:8}

THE Kine have come and brought good fortune: let them rest in the cow-pen and be happy near us.
Here let them stay prolific, many-coloured, and yield through many morns their milk for Indra. {#28:1}

Indra aids him who offers sacrifice and gifts: he takes not what is his, and gives him more thereto.
Increasing ever more and ever more his wealth, he makes the pious dwell within unbroken bounds. {#28:2}

These are ne’er lost, no robber ever injures them: no evil-minded foe attempts to harass them.
The master of the Kine lives many a year with these, the Cows whereby he pours his gifts and serves the Gods. {#28:3}

The charger with his dusty brow o’ertakes them not, and never to the shambles do they take their way.
These Cows, the cattle of the pious worshipper, roam over widespread pasture where no danger is. {#28:4}

To me the Cows seem Bhaga, they seem Indra, they seem a portion of the first-poured Soma.
These present Cows, they, O ye Indra. I long for Indra with my heart and spirit. {#28:5}

O Cows, ye fatten e’en the worn and wasted, and make the unlovely beautiful tolook on.
Prosper my house, ye with auspicious voices. Your power is glorified in our assemblies. {#28:6}

Crop goodly pasturage and be prolific drink pure sweet water at good drinking places.
Never be thief or sinful man your matter, and may the dart of Rudra still avoid you. {#28:7}

Now let this close admixture be close intermigled with these Cows,
Mixt with the Steer's prolific flow, and, Indra, with thy hero might. {#28:8}

For he bestows great wealth, the Thunder-wielder: worship him, Great and Kind, to win his favour. {#29:1}

With his firm arms he holds the reins; his Horses, the Stallions, are yoked ready for the journey. {#29:2}

Thy devotees embrace thy feet for glory. Bold, thunder-armed, rich, through thy strength, in guerdon,
Robed in a garment fair as heaven to look on, thou hast displayed thee like an active dancer. {#29:3}

That Soma when effused hath best consistence, for which the food is dressed and grain is mingled;
By which the men who pray, extolling Indra chief favourites of Gods, recite their praises. {#29:4}

No limit of thy might hath been appointed, which by its greatness sundered earth and heaven.
These the Prince filleth full with strong endeavour, driving, as ’twere, with help his flocks to waters. {#29:5}

So be the lofty Indra prompt to listen, Helper unaided, golden-visored Hero.
Yea, so may he, shown forth in might unequalled, smite down the many Vṛtras and the Dasyus. {#29:6}

## HYMN XXX. Indra.

INDRA hath waxed yet more for hero prowess, alone, Eternal, he bestoweth treasures.
Indra transcendeth both the worlds in greatness: one half of him equalleth earth and heaven. {#30:1}

Yea, mighty I esteem his Godlike nature: none hindereth what he hath once determined.
Near and afar he spread and set the regions, and every day the Sun became apparent. {#30:2}

E’en now endures thine exploit of the Rivers, when, Indra, for their floods thou clavest passage.
Like men who sit at meat the mountains settled: by thee, Most Wise! the regions were made steadfast. {#30:3}

This is the truth, none else is like thee, Indra, no God superior to thee, no mortal.
Thou slewest Ahi who besieged the waters, and lettest loose the streams to hurry seaward. {#30:4}

Indra, thou breakest up the floods and portals on all sides, and the firmness of the mountain.
Thou art the King of men, of all that liveth, engendering at once Sun, Heaven, and Morning. {#30:5}

SOLE Lord of wealth art thou, O Lord of riches: thou in thine hands hast held the people, Indra!
Men have invoked thee with contending voices for seed and waters, progeny and sunlight. {#31:1}

Through fear of thee, O Indra, all the regions of earth, though naught may move them, shake and tremble.
All that is firm is frightened at thy coming, -the earth, the heaven, the mountain, and the forest. {#31:2}

With Kutsa, Indra! thou didst conquer Śuṣṇa, voracious, bane of crops, in fight for cattle.
In the close fray thou rentest him: thou stolest the Sun's wheel and didst drive away misfortunes. {#31:3}

Thou smotest to the ground the hundred castles, impregnable, of Śambara the Dasyu,
When, Strong, with might thou holpest Divodāsa who poured libations out, O Soma-buyer, and madest Bharadvāja rich who praised thee. {#31:4}

As such, true Hero, for great joy of battle mount thy terrific car, O Brave and Manly.
Come with thine help to me, thou distant Roamer, and, glorious God, spread among men my glory. {#31:5}

I WITH my lips have fashioned for this Hero words never matched, most plentiful and auspicious,
For him the Ancient, Great, Strong, Energetic, the very mighty Wielder of the Thunder. {#32:1}

Amid the sages, with the Sun he brightened the Parents: glorified, he burst the mountain;
And, roaring with the holy-thoughted singers, he loosed the bond that held the beams of Morning. {#32:2}

Famed for great deeds, with priests who kneel and laud him, he still hath conquered in the frays for cattle,
And broken down the forts, the Fort-destroyer, a Friend with friends, a Sage among the sages. {#32:3}

Come with thy girthed mares, with abundant vigour and plenteous strength to him who sings thy praises.
Come hither, borne by mares with many heroes, Lover of song! Steer! for the people's welfare. {#32:4}

Thou, with the singers, hast pierced through the Paṇis: the charger whom thou aidest wins the booty. {#33:2}

Both races, Indra, of opposing foemen, O Hero, both the Ārya and the Dāsa,
Hast thou struck down like woods with well-shot lightnings: thou rentest them in fight, most manly Chieftain! {#33:3}

Indra, befriend us with no scanty succour, prosper and aid us, Loved of all that liveth,
When, fighting for the sunlight, we invoke thee, O Hero, in the fray, in war's division. {#33:4}

Be ours, O Indra, now and for the future, be graciously inclined and near to help us.
Thus may we, singing, sheltered by the Mighty, win many cattle on the day of trial. {#33:5}

Now and of old the eulogies of sages, their holy hymns and lauds, have yearned for Indra. {#34:1}

He, praised of many, bold, invoked of many, alone is glorified at sacrifices.
Like a car harnessed for some great achievement, Indra must be the cause of our rejoicing. {#34:2}

They make their way to Indra and exalt him, bim whom no prayers and no laudations trouble;
For when a hundred or a thousand singers. laud him who loves the song their praise delights him. {#34:3}

As brightness mingles with the Moon in heaven, the offered Soma yearns to mix with Indra.
Like water brought to men in desert places, our gifts at sacrifice have still refreshed him. {#34:4}

To him this mighty eulogy, to Indra hath this our laud been uttered by the poets,
That in the great encounter with the foemen, Loved of all life, Indra may guard and help us. {#34:5}

WHEN shall our prayers rest in thy car beside thee? When dost thou give the singer food for thousands?
When wilt thou clothe this poet's laud with plenty, and when wilt thou enrich our hymns with booty? {#35:1}

When wilt thou gatber men with men, O Indra, heroes with heroes, and prevail in combat?
Thou shalt win triply kine in frays for cattle, so, Indra, give thou us celestial glory. {#35:2}

Yea, when wilt thou, O Indra, thou Most Mighty, make the prayer all-sustaining for the singer?
When wilt thou yoke, as we yoke songs, thy Horses, and come to offerings that bring wealth in cattle? {#35:3}

Grant to the Singer food with store of cattle, splendid with horses and the fame of riches.
Send food to swell the milch-cow good at milking: bright be its shine among the Bharadvājas. {#35:4}

Lead otherwise this present foeman, Śakra! Hence art thou praised as Hero, foe destroyer
Him who gives pure gifts may I praise unceasing. Sage, quicken the Aṅgirases by devotion. {#35:5}

For the rein-seizing, the impetuous Charger they furnished power even for Vṛtra's slaughter. {#36:2}

As rivers reach the sea, so, strong with praises, our holy songs reach him the Comprehensive. {#36:3}

Lauded by us, let flow the spring, O Indra, of excellent and brightly-shining riches.
For thou art Lord of men, without an equal: of all the world thou art the only Sovran. {#36:4}

Wherewith, O Thunderer, thou removest sorrow, and, Bold One! partest wealth among the nobles. {#37:4}

Him have they stablished as the days' bright ensign. He made the Mornings to be born in splendour. {#39:3}

He moves with Steeds yoked by eternal Order, contenting men with nave that finds the sunlight. {#39:4}

Gods, we have reached a country void of pasture the land, though spacious, was too small to hold us.
Bṛhaspati, provide in war for cattle; find a path, Indra, for this faithful singer. {#47:20}

Day after day far from their seat he drove them, alike, from place to place, those darksome creatures.
The Hero slew the meanly-huckstering Dāsas, Varcin and Śambara, where the waters gather. {#47:21}

Out of thy bounty, Indra, hath Prastoka bestowed ten coffers and ten mettled horses.
We have received in turn from Divodāsa Śambara's wealth, the gift of Atithigva. {#47:22}

Ten horses and ten treasure-chests, ten garments as an added gift,
These and ten lumps of gold have I received from Divodāsa's hand. {#47:23}

Ten cars with extra steed to each, for the Atharvans hundred cows,
Hath Asvatha to Payu given. {#47:24}

Thus Sṛñjaya's son honoured the Bharadvājas, recipients of all noble gifts and bounty. {#47:25}

Lord of the wood, be firm and strong in body: be, bearing us, a brave victorious hero
Show forth thy strength, compact with straps of leather, and let thy rider win all spoils of battle. {#47:26}

Its mighty strength was borrowed from the heaven and earth: its conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood.
Honour with holy gifts the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car bound round with straps, the vigour of the floods. {#47:27}

Thou Bolt of Indra, Vanguard of the Maruts, close knit to Varuṇa and Child of Mitra,—
As such, accepting gifts which here we offer, receive, O Godlike Chariot, these oblations. {#47:28}

Send forth thy voice aloud through earth and heaven, and let the world in all its breadth regard thee;
O Drum, accordant with the Gods and Indra, drive thou afar, yea, very far, our foemen. {#47:29}

Thunder out strength and fill us full of vigour: yea, thunder forth and drive away all dangers.
Drive hence, O War-drum, drive away misfortune: thou art the Fist of Indra: show thy firmness. {#47:30}

Drive hither those, and these again bring hither: the War-drum speaks aloud as battle's signal.
Our heroes, winged with horses, come together. Let our car-warriors, Indra, be triumphant. {#47:31}

## HYMN XLVIII. Agni and Others.

SING to your Agni with each song, at every sacrifice, for strength.
Come, let us praise the Wise and Everlasting God, even as a well-beloved Friend, {#48:1}

The Son of Strength; for is he not our gracious Lord? Let us serve him who bears our gifts.
In battle may he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the saviour of our lives. {#48:2}

Agni, thou beamest forth with light, great Hero, never changed by time.
Shining, pure Agni! with a light that never fades, beam with thy fair beams brilliantly. {#48:3}

Thou worshippest great Gods: bring them without delay by wisdom and thy wondrous power.
O Agni, make them turn hither to succour us. Give strength, and win it for thyself. {#48:4}

He whom floods, stones, and trees support, the offspring of eternal Law;
He who when rubbed with force is brought to life by men upon the lofty height of earth; {#48:5}

He who hath filled both worlds fult with his brilliant shine, who hastens with his smoke to heaven;
He made himself apparent through the gloom by night, the Red Bull in the darksome nights, the Red Bull in the darksome nights. {#48:6}

O Agni, with thy lofty beams, with thy pure brilliancy, O God,
Kindled, Most Youthful One! by Bharadvāja's hand, shine on us, O pure God, with wealth, shine, Purifier! splendidly. {#48:7}

Thou art the Lord of house and home of all the tribes, O Agni, of all tribes of men.
Guard with a hundred forts thy kindler from distress, through hundred winters, Youngest God! and those who make thy singers rich. {#48:8}

Wonderful, with thy favouring help, send us thy bounties, gracious Lord.
Thou art the Charioteer, Agni, of earthly wealth: find rest and safety for our seed. {#48:9}

With guards unfailing never negligent speed thou our children and our progeny.
Keep far from us, O Agni, all celestial wrath and wickedness of godless men. {#48:10}

Hither, O friends, with newest song drive her who freely pours her milk;
Loose her who never turns away; {#48:11}

Who, for the host of Maruts bright with native sheen, hath shed immortal fame like milk;
Whom the impetuous Maruts look upon with love, who moves in splendour on their ways. {#48:12}

For Bharadvāja she poured down in days of old
The milch-cow yielding milk for all, and food that gives all nourishment. {#48:13}

Your friend like Indra passing wise, with magic power like Varuṇa.
Like Aryaman joy-giving, bringing plenteous food like ViSnxu for my wish, I praise, {#48:14}

Bright as the host of Maruts mighty in their roar. May they bring Pūṣan free from foes;
May they bring hither hundreds, thousands for our men: may they bring hidden stores to light, and make wealth easy to be found. {#48:15}

Haste to me, Pūṣan, in thine car, bright Deity: I fain would speak:
Most sinful is our foeman's hate. {#48:16}

Tear not up by the roots the Kakambira tree: destroy thou all malignity.
Let them not snare by day the neck of that Celestial Bird the Sun. {#48:17}

Uninjured let thy friendship be, like the smooth surface of a skin,
A flawless skin, containing curds, full to the mouth, containing curds. {#48:18}

For thou art high above mankind, in glory equal to the Gods.
Therefore, O Pūṣan, look upon us in the fight: now help us as in days of old. {#48:19}

May the kind excellence of him the Kind, loud Roarers! be our guide,
Be it the God's, O Maruts, or a mortal man's who worships, ye impetuous Ones! {#48:20}

They whose high glory in a moment like the God, the Sun, goes round the space of heaven,
The Maruts have obtained bright strength, a sacred name, strength that destroys the Vṛtras, strength Vṛtra-destroying excellent. {#48:21}

Once, only once, the heaven was made, once only once, the earth was formed-
Once, only Pṛśni's milk was shed: no second, after this, is born. {#48:22}

## HYMN XLIX. Viśvedevas.

I LAUD with newest songs the Righteous People, Mitra and Varuṇa who make us happy.
Let them approach, here let them listen,Agni, Varuṇa, Mitra, Lords of fair dominion. {#49:1}

Him, to be praised at each tribe's sacrifices, the Two young Matrons' sober-minded Herald,
The Son of Strength, the Child of Heaven, the signal of sacrifice, red Agni will I worship. {#49:2}

Unlike in form are the Red God's two Daughters: one is the Sun's, and stars bedeck the other.
Apart, the Sanctifiers, in succession, come to the famed hymn, praised in holy verses. {#49:3}

I with a lofty song call hither Vāyu, all-bounteous, filler of his car, most wealthy.
Thou, Sage, with bright path, Lord of harnessed horses, impetuous, promptly honourest the prudent. {#49:4}

That chariot of the Aśvins, fair to look on, pleaseth me well, yoked with a thought, refulgent,
Wherewith, Nāsatyas, Chiefs, ye seek our dwelling, to give new strength to us and to our children. {#49:5}

Bulls of the Earth, O Vāta and Parjanya, stir up for us the regions of the water.
Hearers of truth, ye, Sages, World-Supporters, increase his living wealth whose songs delight you. {#49:6}

So may Sarasvatī, the Hero's Consort, brisk with rare life, the lightning's Child, inspire us,
And, with the Dames accordant, give the singer a refuge unassailable and flawless. {#49:7}

I praise with eloquence him who guards all pathways. He, when his love impelled him, went to Arka.
May he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it: may Pūṣan make each prayer of ours efective. {#49:8}

May Herald Agni, fulgent, bring for worship Tvaṣṭar adored, in homes and swift to listen,
Glorious, first to share, the life-bestower, the ever active God, fair-armed, fair-handed. {#49:9}

Rudra by day, Rudra at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father.
Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us. {#49:10}

Ye who are youthful, wise, and meet for worship, come, Martits, to the longing of the singer.
Coming, as erst to Aṅgiras, O Heroes, ye animate and quicken e’en the desert. {#49:11}

Even as the herdsman driveth home his cattle, I urge my songs to him the strong swift Hero
May he, the glorious, lay upon his body the singer's hymns, as stars bedeck the heaven. {#49:12}

He who for man's behoof in his afiliction thrice measured out the earthly regions, Viṣṇu-
When one so great as thou affordeth shelter, may we with wealth and with ourselves be happy. {#49:13}

Sweet be this song of mine to Ahibudhnya, Parvata, Savitar, with Floods and Lightnings;
Sweet, with the Plants, to Gods who seek oblations. May liberal Bhaga speed us on to riches. {#49:14}

Give riches borne on cars, with many heroes, contenting men, the guard of mighty Order.
Give us a lasting home that we may battle with godless bands of men who fight against us, and meet with tribes to whom the Gods are gracious. {#49:15}

For, when beset with slight or sore affliction, we ever call upon the Gods, the Maruts; {#50:4}

What time ye hear our call and come, O Maruts, upon your separate path all creatures tremble. {#50:5}

With a new hymn extol, O thou who singest, the Lover of the Song, the Hero Indra.
May he, exalted, hear our invocation, and grant us mighty wealth and strength when lauded. {#50:6}

For ye are our most motherly physicians, parents of all that standeth, all that moveth. {#50:7}

The God who, bounteous as the face of Morning, discloses precious gifts for him who worships. {#50:8}

May I for evermore enjoy thy bounty and, Agni, by thy grace be rich in heroes. {#50:9}

Grant us, O Aditi and ye Ādityas, all of one mind, your manifold protection. {#51:5}

For ye are they who guide aright our bodies, ye are the rulers of our speech and vigour. {#51:6}

Let us not suffer for the sin of others, nor do the deed which ye, O Vasus, punish.
Ye, Universal Gods! are all-controllers: may he do harm unto himself who hates Me. {#51:7}

Mighty is homage: I adopt and use it. Homage hath held in place the earth and heaven.
Homage to Gods! Homage commands and rules them. I banish even committed sin by homage {#51:8}

To you all Heroes mighty and far-seeing I bow me down, O Holy Ones, with homage. {#51:9}

Far, far, Lord of the brave I and give us easy paths. {#51:13}

Soma, these pressing-stones have called aloud to win thee for our Friend.
Destroy the greedy Paṇi, for a wolf is he. {#51:14}

Give us good paths for travel: guard us ivell at home. {#51:15}

Now have we entered on the road that leads to bliss, without a foe,
The road whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers wealth. {#51:16}

Or he who holds us in contempt, O Maruts, or seeks to blame the prayer that we are making,
May agonies of burning be his portion. May the sky scorch the man who hates devotion. {#52:2}

Why then, O Soma, do they call thee keeper of prayer? Why then our guardian from reproaches?
Why then beholdest thou how men revile us? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion. {#52:3}

May Mornings as they spring to life, protect me, and may the Rivers as they swell preserve me.
My guardians be the firmly-seated mountains: the Fathers, when I call on Gods, defend me! {#52:4}

May they vouchsafe us life of full duration. May the Gods kindly give us nights and mornings. {#52:15}

At this my call, O Agni and Parjanya, help, swift to hear, my thought and our laudation.
One generates holy food, the other offspring, so grant us food enough with store of children. {#52:16}

Bring us the wealth that men require, a manly master of a house,
Free-handed with the liberal meed. {#53:2}

Even him who would not give, do thou,

And make the niggard's soul grow soft. {#53:3}

Clear paths that we may win the prize; scatter our enemies afar.
Strong God, be all our thoughts fulfilled. {#53:4}

And make him subject to our will. {#53:6}

Tear up and read in pieces, Sage, the hearts of avaricious churls,
And make them subject to our will. {#53:7}

Thou, glowing Pūṣan, carriest an awl that urges men to prayer;
Therewith do thou tear up and rend to shreds the heart of every one. {#53:8}

Thou bearest, glowing Lord! a goad with horny point that guides the cows
Thence do we seek thy gift of bliss. {#53:9}

For our delight and use as men. {#53:10}

The golden wheel of Sūra's car. {#56:3}

Whate’er we speak this day to thee, Wise, Wondrous God whom many praise,

One of you, yoking Steeds that move to every side, advances in your common car. {#59:5}

Stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue, she hath gone downward thirty steps. {#59:6}

May the divine Sarasvatī, rich in her wealth, protect us well,
Furthering all our thoughts with might {#61:4}

Whoso, divine Sarasvatī, invokes thee where the prize is set,
Like Indra when he smites the foe. {#61:5}

Aid us, divine Sarasvad, thou who art strong in wealth and power
Like Pūṣan, give us opulence. {#61:6}

Yea, this divine Sarasvatī, terrible with her golden path,
Foe-slayer, claims our eulogy. {#61:7}

Whose limitless unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush,
Comes onward with tempestuous roar. {#61:8}

She hath spread us beyond all foes, beyond her Sisters, Holy One,
As Sūrya spreadeth out the days. {#61:9}

Yea, she most dear amid dear stream, Seven-sistered, graciously inclined,
Sarasvatī hath earned our praise. {#61:10}

Guard us from hate Sarasvatī, she who hath filled the realms of earth,
And that wide tract, the firmament! {#61:11}

Seven-sistered, sprung from threefold source, the Five Tribes' prosperer, she must be
Invoked in every deed of might. {#61:12}

Marked out by majesty among the Mighty Ones, in glory swifter than the other rapid Streams,
Created vast for victory like a chariot, Sarasvatī must be extolled by every sage. {#61:13}

Guide us, Sarasvatī, to glorious treasure: refuse us not thy milk, nor spurn us from thee.
Gladly accept our friendship and obedience: let us not go from thee to distant countries. {#61:14}

## HYMN LXII. Aśvins.

I LAUD the Heroes Twain, this heaven's Controllers: singing with songs of praise I call the Aśvins,
Fain in a moment, when the morns are breaking, to part the earth's ends and the spacious regions. {#62:1}

Moving to sacrifice through realms of lustre they light the radiance of the car that bears them.
Traversing many wide unmeasured spaces, over the wastes ye pass, and fields, and waters. {#62:2}

Ye to that bounteous path of yours, ye mighty, have ever borne away our thoughts with horses,
Mind-swift and full of vigour, that the trouble of man who offers gifts might cease and slumber. {#62:3}

So ye, when ye have yoked your chariothorses, come to the hymn of the most recent singer.
Our true and ancient Herald Priest shall bring you, the Youthful, bearing splendour, food, and vigour. {#62:4}

With newest hymn I call those Wonder-Workers, ancient and brilliant, and exceeding mighty,
Bringers of bliss to him who lauds and praises, bestowing varied bounties on the singer. {#62:5}

So ye, with birds, out of the sea and waters bore Bhujyu, son of Tugra, through the regions.
Speeding with winged steeds through dustless spaces, out of the bosom of the flood they bore him. {#62:6}

Victors, car-borne, ye rent the rock asunder: Bulls, heard the calling of the eunuch's consort.
Bounteous, ye filled the cow with milk for Śayu: thus, swift and zealous Ones, ye showed your favour. {#62:7}

Whate’er from olden time, Heaven, Earth! existeth great object of the wrath of Gods and mortals,
Make that, Ādityas, Vasus, sons of Rudra, an evil brand to one allied with demons. {#62:8}

May he who knows, as Varuṇa and Mitra, air's realm, appointing both the Kings in season,
Against the secret fiend cast forth his weapon, against the lying words that strangers utter. {#62:9}

Come to our home with friendly wheels, for offipring; come on your radiant chariot rich in heroes.
Strike off, ye Twain, the heads of our assailants who with man's treacherous attack approach us. {#62:10}

Come hitherward to us with teams of horses, the highest and the midmost and the lowest.
Bountiful Lords, throw open to the singer doors e’en of the firm-closed stall of cattle. {#62:11}

* * *

## HYMN LXIII. Aśvins.

WHERE hath the hymn with reverence, like an envoy, found both fair Gods to-day, invoked of many-
Hymn that hath brought the two Nāsatyas hither? To this man's thought be ye, both Gods, most friendly. {#63:1}

Come readily to this mine invocation, lauded with songs, that ye may drink the juices.
Compass this house to keep it from the foeman, that none may force it, either near or distant. {#63:2}

Juice in wide room hath been prepared to feast you: for you the grass is strewn, most soft to tread on.
With lifted hands your servant hath adored you. Yearningfor you the press-stones shed the liquid. {#63:3}

Agni uplifts him at your sacrifices: forth goes the oblation dropping oil and glowing.
Up stands the grateful-minded priest, elected, appointed to invoke the two Nāsatyas. {#63:4}

Lords of great wealth! for glory, Sūrya's Daughter mounted your car that brings a hundred succours.
Famed for your magic arts were ye, magicians! amid the race of Gods, ye dancing Heroes! {#63:5}

Ye Twain, with these your glories fair to look on, brought, to win victory, rich gifts for Sūrya.
After you flew your birds, marvels of beauty: dear to our hearts! the song, well lauded, reached you. {#63:6}

May your winged coursers, best to draw. Nāsatyas! convey you to the object of your wishes.
Swift as the thought, your car hath been sent onward to food of many a sort and dainty viands. {#63:7}

Lords of great wealth, manifold is your bounty: ye filled our cow with food that never faileth.
Lovers of sweetness! yours are praise and singers, and poured libations which have sought your favour. {#63:8}

Mine were two mares of Puraya, brown, swift-footed; a hundred with Sumidha, food with Peruk
Sanda gave ten gold-decked and well-trained horses, tame and obedient and of lofty stature. {#63:9}

Nāsatyas! Purupanthas offered hundreds, thousands of steeds to him who sang your praises,
Gave, Heroes! to the singer Bharadvāja. Ye-Wonder-Workers, let the fiends be slaughtered. {#63:10}

May I with princes share your bliss in freedom. {#63:11}

* * *

## HYMN LXIV. Dawn.

THE radiant Dawns have risen up for glory, in their white splendour like the waves of waters.
She maketh paths all easy, fair to travel, and, rich, hath shown herself benign and friendly. {#64:1}

We see that thou art good: far shines thy lustre; thy beams, thy splendours have flown up to heaven.
Decking thyself, thou makest bare thy bosom, shining in majesty, thou Goddess Morning. {#64:2}

Red are the kine and luminous that bear her the Blessed One who spreadeth through the distance.
The foes she chaseth like a valiant archer, like a swift warrior she repelleth darkness. {#64:3}

Thy ways are easy on the hills: thou passest Invincible! Se1f-luminous! through waters.
So lofty Goddess with thine ample pathway, Daughter of Heaven, bring wealth to give us comfort. {#64:4}

Dawn, bring me wealth: untroubled, with thine oxen thou bearest riches at thy will and pleasure;
Thou who, a Goddess, Child of Heaven, hast shown thee lovely through bounty when we called thee early. {#64:5}

As the birds fly forth from their restingplaces, so men with store of food rise at thy dawning.
Yea, to the liberal mortal who rernaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much good thou bringest. {#64:6}

* * *

## HYMN LXV. Dawn.

SHEDDING her light on human habitations this Child of Heaven hath called us from our slumber;
She who at night-time with her argent lustre hath shown herself e’en through the shades of darkness. {#65:1}

All this with red-rayed steeds have they divided: the Dawns on bright cars shine in wondrous fashion.
They, bringing near the stately rite's commencement, drive far away the night's surrounding shadows. {#65:2}

Dawns, bringing hither, to the man who worships, glory and power and might and food and vigour,
Opulent, with imperial sway like heroes, favour your servant and this day enrich him. {#65:3}

Now is there treasure for the man who serves you, now for the hero, Dawns! who brings oblation;
Now for the singer when he sings the praise-song. Even to one like me ye brought aforetime. {#65:4}

O Dawn who standest on the mountain ridges, Aṅgirases now praise thy stalls of cattle.
With prayer and holy hymn they burst them open: the heroes' calling on the Gods was fruitful. {#65:5}

Shine on us as of old, thou Child of Heaven,on him, rich Maid! who serves like Bharadvāja.
Give to the singer wealth with noble heroes, and upon us bestow wide-spreading glory. {#65:6}

## HYMN LXVI. Maruts.

E'EN to the wise let that be still a wonder to which the general name of Cow is given.
The one hath swelled among mankind for milking: Pṛśni hath drained but once her fair bright udder. {#66:1}

They who like kindled flames of fire are glowing,. the Maruts, twice and thrice have waxen mighty.
Golden and dustless were their cars, invested with their great strength and their heroic vigour. {#66:2}

They who are Sons of the rain-pouring Rudra, whom the long-lasting One had power to foster:
The Mighty Ones whose germ great Mother Pṛśni is known to have received for man's advantage. {#66:3}

They shrink not from the birth; in this same manner still resting there they purge away reproaches.
When they have streamed forth, brilliant, at their pleasure, with their own splendour they bedew their bodies. {#66:4}

Even those who bear the brave bold name of Maruts, whom not the active quickly wins for milking.
Even the liberal wards not off those fierce ones, those who are light and agile in their greatness. {#66:5}

When, strong in strength and armed with potent weapons, they had united wellformed earth and heaven,
Rodasl stood among these furious Heroes like splendour shining with her native brightness. {#66:6}

No team of goats shall draw your car, O Maruts, no horse no charioteer be he who drives it.
Halting not, reinless, through the air it travels, speeding alone its paths through earth and heaven. {#66:7}

None may obstruct, none overtake, O Maruts, him whom ye succour in the strife of battle
For sons and progeny, for kine and waters: he bursts the cow-stall on the day of trial. {#66:8}

Bring a bright hymn to praise the band of Maruts, the Singers, rapid, strong in native vigour,
Who conquer mighty strength with strength more mighty: earth shakes in terror at their wars, O Agni. {#66:9}

Bright like the flashing flames of sacrifices, like tongues of fire impetuous in their onset,
Chanting their psalm, singing aloud, like heroes, splendid from birth, invincible, the Maruts. {#66:10}

That swelling band I call with invocation, the brood of Rudra, armed with glittering lances.
Pure hymns are meet for that celestial army: like floods and mountains have the Strong Ones battled. {#66:11}

* * *

## HYMN LXVII Mitra-Varuṇa.

NOW Mitra-Varuṇa shall be exalted high by your songs, noblest of all existing;
They who, as ’twere with reins are best Controllers, unequalled with their arms to check the people. {#67:1}

To you Two Gods is this my thought extended, turned to the sacred grass with loving homage.
Give us, O Mitra-Varuṇa, a dwelling safe from attack, which ye shall guard, Boon-Givers! {#67:2}

Come hither, Mitra-Varuṇa, invited with eulogies and loving adoration,
Ye who with your might, as Work-Controllers, urge even men who quickly hear to labour. {#67:3}

Whom, of pure origin, like two strong horses, Aditi bore as babes in proper season,
Whom, Mighty at your birth, the Mighty Goddess brought forth as terrors to the mortal foeman. {#67:4}

As all the Gods in their great joy and gladness gave you with one accord your high dominion,
As ye surround both worlds, though wide and spacious your spies are ever true and never bewildered. {#67:5}

So, through the days maintaining princely power. ye prop the height as ’twere from loftiest heaven.
The Star of all the Gods, established, filleth the heaven and earth with food of man who liveth. {#67:6}

Take the strong drink, to quaff till ye are sated, when he and his attendants fill the chamber.
The young Maids brook not that none seeks to win them, when, Quickeners of all! they scatter moisture. {#67:7}

So with your tongue come ever, when your envoy, faithful and very wise, attends our worship.
Nourished by holy oil! he this yGur glory: annihilate the sacrificer's trouble. {#67:8}

When, Mitra-Varuṇa, they strive against you and break tlie friendly laws ye have established,
They, neither Gods nor men in estimation, like Api's sons have godless sacrifices. {#67:9}

When singers in their song uplift their voices, some chant the Nivid texts with steady purpose.
Then may we sing you lauds that shall be fruitful: dp ye not rival all the Gods in greatness? {#67:10}

O Mitra-Varuṇa, may your large bounty come to us hither, near to this our dwelling,
When the kine haste to us, and when they harness the fleet-foot mettled stallion for the battle. {#67:11}

* * *

## HYMN LXVIII. Indra-Varuṇa.

HIS honouring rite whose grass is trimmed is offered swiftly to you, in Manu's wise, accordant,
The rite which Indra-Varuṇa shall carry this day to high success and glorious issue. {#68:1}

For at Gods’ worship they are best through vigour; they have become the strongest of the Heroes;
With mighty strength, most liberal of the Princes, Chiefs of the host, by Law made Vṛtra's slayers. {#68:2}

Praise those Twain Gods for powers that merit worship, Indra and Varuṇa, for bliss, the joyous.
One with his might and thunderbolt slays Vṛtra; the other as a Sage stands near in troubles. {#68:3}

Though dames and men have waxen strong and mighty, and all the Gods selfpraised among the Heroes,
Ye, Indra-Varuṇa, have in might surpassed them, and thus were ye spread wide, O Earth and Heaven. {#68:4}

Righteous is he, and liberal and helpful who, Indra-Varuṇa, brings you gifts with gladness.
That bounteous man through food shall conquer faemen, and win him opulence and wealthy people. {#68:5}

May wealth which ye bestow in food and treasure on him who brings you gifts and sacrifices,
Wealth, Gods! which breaks the curse of those who vex us, be, Indra-Varuṇa, e’en our own possession. {#68:6}

So also, Indra-Varuṇa, may our princes have riches swift to save, with Gods to guard them-
They whose great might gives victory in battles, and their triumphant glory spreads with swiftness. {#68:7}

Indra. and Varuṇa, Gods whom we are lauding, mingle ye wealth with our heroic glory.
May we, who praise the strength of what is mighty, pass dangers, as with boats we cross the waters. {#68:8}

Now will I sing a dear and far-extending hymn to Varuṇa the God, sublime, imperial Lord,
Who, mighty Governor, Eternal, as with flame, illumines both wide worlds with majesty and power. {#68:9}

True to Law, Indra-Varuṇa, drinkers of the juice, drink this pressed Soma which shall give you rapturous joy.
Your chariot cometh to the banquet of the Gods, to sacrifice, as it were home, that ye may drink. {#68:10}

Indra and Varuṇa, drink your fill, ye Heroes, of this invigorating sweetest Soma.
This juice is shed by us that ye may quaff it: on this trimmed grass be seated, and rejoice you {#68:11}

* * *

Accept the sacrifice and grant us riches, leading us on by unobstructed pathways. {#69:1}

Ye who inspire all hymns, Indra and Viṣṇu, ye vessels who contain the Soma juices,
May hymns of praise that now are sung address you, the lauds that are recited by the singers. {#69:2}

Lords of joy-giving draughts, Indra and Viṣṇu, come, giving gifts of treasure, to the Soma.
With brilliant rays of hymns let chanted praises, repeated with the lauds, adorn and deck you. {#69:3}

May your foe-conquering horses bring you hither, Indra and Viṣṇu, sharers of the banquet.
Of all our hymns accept the invocations list to my prayers and hear the songs I sing you. {#69:4}

This your deed, Indra-Viṣṇu, must be lauded: widely ye strode in the wild joy of Soma.
Ye made the firmament of larger compass, and made the regions broad for our existence. {#69:5}

Strengthened with sacred offerings, IndraViṣṇu, first eaters, served with worship ana oblation,
Fed with the holy oil, vouchsafe us riches ye are the lake, the vat that holds the Soma. {#69:6}

Drink of this meath, O Indra, thou, and Viṣṇu; drink ye your fill of Soma, Wonder-Workers.
The sweet exhilarating juice hath reached you. Hear ye my prayers, give ear unto my calling. {#69:7}

Ye Twain have conquered, ne’er have yc been conquered: never hath either of the Twain been vanquished.
Ye, Indra-Viṣṇu, when ye fought the battle, produced this infinite with three divisions. {#69:8}

## HYMN LXX. Heaven and Earth.

The Heaven and the Earth by Varuṇa's decree, unwasting, rich in germs, stand parted each from each. {#70:1}

Ye who are Regents of this world, O Earth and Heaven, pour into us the genial flow that prospers meit. {#70:2}

He in his seed is born again and spreads by Law: from you flow things diverse in form, but ruled alike. {#70:3}

Wide, broad, set foremost at election of the priest, to them the singers pray for bliss to further them. {#70:4}

Bestowing by your Godhead sacrifice and wealth, great fame and strength for us and good heroic might. {#70:5}

God of the golden tongue, keep us for newest bliss: let not the evil-wisher have us in his power. {#71:3}

## HYMN LXXII. Indra-Soma.

GREAT is this might of yours, Indra and Soma: the first high exploits were your own achievements.
Ye found the Sun ye found the light of heaven: ye killed all darkness and the Gods’ blasphemers. {#72:1}

Ye, Indra-Soma, gave her light to Morning, and led the Sun on high with all his splendour.
Ye stayed the heaven with a supporting pillar, and spread abroad apart, the Earth, the Mother. {#72:2}

Ye slew the flood -obstructing serpent Vṛtra, Indra and Soma: Heaven approved your exploit.
Ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers, and many seas have ye filled full with waters. {#72:3}

Unwearied, armed with shafts and wondrous weapons, free, real heroes, conquerors of armies. {#75:9}

Her tooth a deer, dressed in an eagle's feathers, bound with cow-hide, launched forth, She flieth onward.
There where the heroes speed hither and thither, there may the Arrows shelter and protect us. {#75:11}

Avoid us thou whose flight is straight, and let our bodies be as stone.
May Soma kindly speak to us, and Aditi protect us well. {#75:12}

He lays his blows upon their backs, he deals his blows upon their thighs.
Thou, Whip, who urgest horses, drive sagacious horses in the fray. {#75:13}

It compasses the arm with serpent windings, fending away the friction of the bowstring:
So may the Brace, well-skilled in all its duties, guard manfully the man from every quarter. {#75:14}

Now to the Shaft with venom smeared, tipped with deer-horn, with iron mouth,
Celestial, of Parjanya's seed, be this great adoration paid. {#75:15}

Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou Arrow, sharpened by our prayer.
Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive. {#75:16}

There where the flights of Arrows fall like boys whose locks are yet unshorn.
Even there may Brahmaṇaspati, and Aditi protect us well, protect us well through all our days. {#75:17}

Thy vital parts I cover with thine Armour: with immortality King Soma clothe thee.
Varuṇa give thee what is more than ample, and in thy triumph may the Gods be joyful. {#75:18}
