## HYMN I. Indra.

GLORIFY naught besides, O friends; so shall no sorrow trouble you.
Praise only mighty Indra when the juice is shed, and say your lauds repeatedly: {#1:1}

Even him, eternal, like a bull who rushes down, men's Conqueror, bounteous like a cow;
Him who is cause of both, of enmity and peace, to both sides most munificent. {#1:2}

Although these men in sundry ways invoke thee to obtain thine aid,
Be this our prayer, addressed, O Indra, unto thee, thine exaltation every day. {#1:3}

Those skilled in song, O Maghavan among these men o’ercome with might the foeman's songs.
Come hither, bring us strength in many a varied form most near that it may succour us. {#1:4}

O Caster of the Stone, I would not sell thee for a mighty price,
Not for a thousand, Thunderer! nor ten thousand, nor a hundred, Lord of countless wealth! {#1:5}

O Indra, thou art more to me than sire or niggard brother is.
Thou and my mother, O Good Lord, appear alike, to give me wealth abundantly. {#1:6}

Where art thou? Whither art thou gone? For many a place attracts thy mind.
Haste, Warrior, Fort-destroyer, Lord of battle's din, haste, holy songs have sounded forth. {#1:7}

Sing out the psalm to him who breaks down castles for his faithful friend,
Verses to bring the Thunderer to destroy the forts and sit on Kaṇva's sacred grass. {#1:8}

The Horses which are thine in tens, in hundreds, yea, in thousands thine,
Even those vigorous Steeds, fleet-footed in the course, with those come quickly near to us. {#1:9}

This day I call Sabardughā who animates the holy song,
Indra the richly-yielding Milch-cow who provides unfailing food in ample stream. {#1:10}

When Sūra wounded Etaśa, with Vāta's rolling winged car.
Indra bore Kutsa Ārjuneya off, and mocked Gandharva. the unconquered One. {#1:11}

He without ligature, before making incision in the neck,
Closed up the wound again, most wealthy Maghavan, who maketh whole the injured part. {#1:12}

May we be never cast aside, and strangers, as it were, to thee.
We, Thunder-wielding Indra, count ourselves as trees rejected and unfit to burn. {#1:13}

O Vṛtra-slayer, we were thought slow and unready for the fray.
Yet once in thy great bounty may we have delight, O Hero, after praising thee. {#1:14}

If he will listen to my laud, then may out Soma-drops that flow
Rapidly through the strainer gladden Indra, drops due to the Tugryas’ Strengthener. {#1:15}

Come now unto the common laud of thee and of thy faithful friend.
So may our wealthy nobles’ praise give joy to thee. Fain would I sing thine eulogy. {#1:16}

Press out the Soma with the stones, and in the waters wash it clean.
The men investing it with raiment made of milk shall milk it forth from out the stems. {#1:17}

Whether thou come from earth or from the lustre of the lofty heaven,
Wax stronger in thy body through my song of praise: fill full all creatures, O most Wise. {#1:18}

For India press the Soma out, most gladdening and most excellent.
May Śakra make it swell sent forth with every prayer and asking, as it were, for strength. {#1:19}

Let me not, still beseeching thee with earnest song at Soma rites,
Anger thee like some wild beast. Who would not beseech him who hath power to grant his prayer? {#1:20}

The draught made swift with rapturous joy, effectual with its mighty strength,
All-conquering, distilling transport, let him drink: for he in ecstasy gives us gifts. {#1:21}

Where bliss is not, may he, All-praised, God whom the pious glorify,
Bestow great wealth upon the mortal worshipper who sheds the juice and praises him. {#1:22}

Come, Indra, and rejoice thyself, O God, in manifold affluence.
Thou fillest like a lake thy vast capacious bulk with Soma and with draughts besides. {#1:23}

A thousand and a hundred Steeds are harnessed to thy golden car.
So may the long-maned Bays, yoked by devotion, bring Indra to drink the Soma juice. {#1:24}

Yoked to thy chariot wrought of gold, may thy two Bays with peacock tails,
Convey thee hither, Steeds with their white backs, to quaff sweet juice that makes us eloquent. {#1:25}

So drink, thou Lover of the Song, as the first drinker, of this juice.
This the outpouring of the savoury sap prepared is good and meet to gladden thee. {#1:26}

He who alone by wondrous deed is Mighty, Strong by holy works,
May he come, fair of cheek; may he not stay afar, but come and turn not from our call. {#1:27}

Śuṣṇa's quick moving castle thou hast crushed to pieces with thy bolts.
Thou, Indra, from of old, hast followed after light, since we have had thee to invoke. {#1:28}

My praises when the Sun hath risen, my praises at the time of noon,
My praises at the coming of the gloom of night, O Vasu, have gone forth to thee. {#1:29}

Praise yea, praise him. Of princes these are the most liberal of their gifts,
These, Paramajyā, Ninditāśva, Prapathī, most bounteous, O Medhyātithi. {#1:30}

When to the car, by faith, I yoked the horses longing for the way-
For skilled is Yadu's son in dealing precious wealth, he who is rich in herds of kine. {#1:31}

May he who gave me two brown steeds together with their cloths of gold,
May he, Āsaṅga's son Svanadratha, obtain all joy and high felicities. {#1:32}

Playoga's son Āsaṅga, by ten thousand, O Agni, hath surpassed the rest in giving.
For me ten bright-hued oxen have come forward like lotus-stalks from out a lake upstanding. {#1:33}

What time her husband's perfect restoration to his lost strength and manhood was apparent,
His consort Śaśvatī with joy addressed him, Now art thou well, my lord, and shalt be happy. {#1:34}

* * *

## HYMN II. Indra.

HERE is the Soma juice expressed; O Vasu, drink till thou art full:
Undaunted God, we give it thee. {#2:1}

Washed by the men, pressed out with stones, strained through the filter made of wool,
’Tis like a courser bathed in stream. {#2:2}

This juice have we made sweet for thee like barley, blending it with milk.
Indra, I call thee to our feast. {#2:3}

Beloved of all, Indra alone drinks up the flowing Soma juice
Among the Gods and mortal men. {#2:4}

The Friend, whom not the brilliant-hued, the badly-mixt or bitter draught,
Repels, the far-extending God; {#2:5}

While other men than we with milk chase him as hunters chase a deer,
And with their kine inveigle him. {#2:6}

For him, for Indra, for the God, be pressed three draughts of Soma juice
In the juice-drinker's own abode. {#2:7}

Three reservoirs exude their drops, filled are three beakers to the brim,
All for one offering to the God. {#2:8}

Pure art thou, set in many a place, and blended in the midst with milk
And curd, to cheer the Hero best. {#2:9}

Here, Indra, are thy Soma-draughts pressed out by us, the strong, the pure:
They crave admixture of the milk. {#2:10}

O Indra, pour in milk, prepare the cake, and mix the Soma-draught.
I hear them say that thou art rich. {#2:11}

Quaffed juices fight within the breast. The drunken praise not by their wine,
The naked praise not when it rains. {#2:12}

Rich be the praiser of one rich, munificent and famed like thee:
High rank be his, O Lord of Bays. {#2:13}

Foe of the man who adds no milk, he heeds not any chanted hymn
Or holy psalm that may he sung. {#2:14}

Give us not, Indra, as a prey unto the scornful or the proud:
Help, Mighty One, with power and might. {#2:15}

This, even this, O Indra, we implore. as thy devoted friends,
The Kaṇvas praise thee with their hymns. {#2:16}

Naught else, O Thunderer, have I praised in the skilled singer's eulogy:
On thy land only have I thought. {#2:17}

The Gods seek him who presses out the Soma; they desire not sleep
They punish sloth unweariedly. {#2:18}

Come hither swift with gifts of wealth - be not thou angry with us-like
A great man with a youthful bride. {#2:19}

Let him not, wrathful with us, spend the evening far from us to-day,
Like some unpleasant son-in-law. {#2:20}

For well we know this Hero's love, most liberal of the boons he gives,
His plans whom the three worlds display. {#2:21}

Pour forth the gift which Kaṇvas bring, for none more glorious do we know
Than the Strong Lord with countless aids. {#2:22}

O presser, offer Soma first to Indra, Hero, Śakra, him
The Friend of man, that he may drink; {#2:23}

Who, in untroubled ways, is best provider, for his worshippers.
Of strength in horses and in kine. {#2:24}

Pressers, for him blend Soma juice, each draught most excellent, for him
The Brave, the Hero, for his joy. {#2:25}

The Vṛtra-slayer drinks the juice. May he who gives a hundred aids
Approach, nor stay afar from us. {#2:26}

May the strong Bay Steeds, yoked by prayer, bring hither unto us our Friend,
Lover of Song, renowned by songs. {#2:27}

Sweet are the Soma juices, come! Blent are the Soma juices, come!
Ṛṣi-like, mighty, fair of cheek, come hither quickly to the feast. {#2:28}

And lauds which strengthen thee for great bounty and valour, and exalt
Indra who doeth glorious deeds, {#2:29}

And songs to thee who lovest song, and all those hymns addressed to thee-
These evermore confirm thy might. {#2:30}

Thus he, sole doer of great deeds whose hand holds thunder, gives us strength,
He who hath never been subdued. {#2:31}

Vṛtra he slays with his right hand, even Indra, great with mighty power,
And much-invoked in many a place. {#2:32}

He upon whom all men depend, all regions, all achievements, he
Takes pleasure in our wealthy chiefs. {#2:33}

All this hath he accomplished, yea, Indra, most gloriously renowned,
Who gives our wealthy princes strength. {#2:34}

Who drives his chariot seeking spoil, from afar, to him he loves:
For swift is he to bring men wealth. {#2:35}

The Sage who, winning spoil with steeds, slays Vṛtra, Hero with the men,
His servant's faithful succourer. {#2:36}

O Priyamedhas, worship with collected mind this Indra whom
The Soma hath full well inspired. {#2:37}

Ye Kaṇvas, sing the Mighty One, Lord of the Brave, who loves renown,
All-present, glorified by song. {#2:38}

Strong Friend, who, with no trace of feet, restores the cattle to the men,
Who rest their wish and hope on him. {#2:39}

Shaped as a Ram, Stone-hurler I once thou camest hither to the son
Of Kaṇva, wise Medhyātithi. {#2:40}

Vibhindu, thou hast helped this man, giving him thousands four times ten,
And afterward eight thousand more. {#2:41}

And these twain pouring streams of milk, creative, daughters of delight,
For wedlock sake I glorify. {#2:42}

* * *

## HYMN III. Indra.

DRINK, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer thee with our milky draught.
Be, for our weal, our Friend and sharer of the feast, and let thy wisdom guard us well. {#3:1}

In thy kind grace and favour may we still be strong: expose us not to foe's attack.
With manifold assistance guard and succour us, and bring us to felicity. {#3:2}

May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast abundant wealth.
Men skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have sung them with their lauds to thee. {#3:3}

He, with his might enhanced by Ṛṣis thousandfold, hath like an ocean spread himself.
His majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power where holy singers rule. {#3:4}

Indra for worship of the Gods, Indra while sacrifice proceeds,
Indra, as worshippers in battle-shock, we call, Indra that we may win the spoil. {#3:5}

With might hath Indra spread out heaven and earth, with power hath Indra lighted up the Sun.
In Indra are all creatures closely held; in him meet the distilling Soma-drops. {#3:6}

Men with their lauds are urging thee, Indra, to drink the Soma first.
The Ṛbhus in accord have lifted up their voice, and Rudras sung thee as the first. {#3:7}

Indra increased his manly strength at sacrifice, in the wild rapture of this juice.
And living men to-day, even as of old, sing forth their praises to his majesty. {#3:8}

I crave of thee that hero strength, that thou mayst first regard this prayer,
Wherewith thou holpest Bhṛgu and the Yatis and Praskaṇva when the prize was staked. {#3:9}

Wherewith thou sentest mighty waters to the sea, that, Indra, is thy manly strength.
For ever unattainable is this power of him to whom the worlds have cried aloud. {#3:10}

Help us, O Indra, when we pray to thee for wealth and hero might.
First help thou on to strength the man who strives to win, and aid our laud, O Ancient One. {#3:11}

Help for us, Indra, as thou holpest Paura once, this man's devotions bent on gain.
Help, as thou gavest Ruśama and Śyāvaka and Svarṇara and Kṛpa aid. {#3:12}

What newest of imploring prayers shall, then, the zealous mortal sing?
For have not they who laud his might, and Indra-power won for themselves the light of heaven? {#3:13}

When shall they keep the Law and praise thee mid the Gods? Who counts as Ṛṣi and as sage?
When ever wilt thou, Indra Maghavan, come nigh to presser's or to praiser's call? {#3:14}

These songs of ours exceeding sweet, these hymns of praise ascend to thee,
Like ever-conquering chariots that display their strength, gain wealth, and give unfailing aid. {#3:15}

The Bhṛgus are like Suns, like Kaṇvas, and have gained all that their thoughts were bent upon.
The living men of Priyamedha's race have sung exalting Indra with their lauds. {#3:16}

Best slayer of the Vṛtras, yoke thy Bay Steeds, Indra, from afar.
Come with the High Ones hither, Maghavan, to us, Mighty, to drink the Soma juice. {#3:17}

For these, the bards and singers, have cried out to thee with prayer, to gain the sacrifice.
As such, O Maghavan, Indra, who lovest song, even as a lover bear my call. {#3:18}

Thou from the lofty plains above, O Indra, hurledst Vṛtra down.
Thou dravest forth the kine of guileful Mṛgaya and Arbuda from the mountain's hold. {#3:19}

Bright were the flaming fires, the Sun gave forth his shine, and Soma, Indra's juice, shone clear.
Indra, thou blewest the great Dragon from the air: men must regard that valorous deed. {#3:20}

The fairest courser of them all, who runneth on as ’twere to heaven.
Which Indra and the Maruts gave, and Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇ. {#3:21}

To me hath Pākasthāman given, a ruddy horse, good at the pole,
Filling is girth and rousing wealth; {#3:22}

Compared with whom no other ten strong coursers, harnessed to the pole,
Bear Tugrya to his dwelling place. {#3:23}

Raiment is body, food is life, and healing ointment giveth strength.
As the free-handed giver of the ruddy steed, I have named Pākasthāman fourth. {#3:24}

* * *

## HYMN IV. Indra.

THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men eastward and westward, north and south,
Thou chiefly art with Ānava and Turvaśa, brave Champion I urged by men to Come. {#4:1}

Or, Indra, when with Ruma, Ruśama, Śyāvaka, and Kṛpa thou rejoicest thee,
Still do the Kaṇvas, bringing praises, with their prayers, O Indra, draw thee hither: come. {#4:2}

Even as the wild-bull, when he thirsts, goes to the desert's watery pool,
Come hither quickly both at morning and at eve, and with the Kaṇvas drink thy fill. {#4:3}

May the drops gladden thee, rich Indra, and obtain bounty for him who pours the juice.
Soma pressed in the mortar didst thou take and drink, and hence hast won surpassing might. {#4:4}

With mightier strength he conquered strength, with energy he crushed their wrath.
O Indra, Strong in youth, all those who sought the fray bent and bowed down to thee like trees. {#4:5}

He who wins promise of thine aid goes girt as with a thousand mighty men of war.
He makes his son preeminent in hero might: he serves with reverential prayer. {#4:6}

With thee, the Mighty, for our Friend, we will not fear or feel fatigue.
May we see Turvaśa and Yadu: thy great deed, O Hero, must be glorified. {#4:7}

On his left hip the Hero hath reclined himself: the proffered feast offends him not.
The milk is blended with the honey of the bee: quickly come hither, baste, and drink. {#4:8}

Indra, thy friend is fair of form and rich in horses, cars, and kine.
He evermore hath food accompanied by wealth, and radiant joins the company. {#4:9}

Come like a thirsty antelope to the drinking-place: drink Soma to thy heart's desire.
Raining it down, O Maghavan, day after day, thou gainest thy surpassing might. {#4:10}

Priest, let the Soma juice flow forth, for Indra longs to drink thereof.
He even now hath yoked his vigorous Bay Steeds: the Vṛtra-slayer hath come near. {#4:11}

The man with whom thou fillcst thee with Soma deems himself a pious worshipper.
This thine appropriate food is here poured out for thee: come, hasten forward. drink of it, {#4:12}

Press out the Soma juice, ye priests, for Indra borne upon his car.
The pressing-stones speak loud of Indra, while they shed the juice which, offered, honours him. {#4:13}

To the brown juice may his dear vigorous Bay Steeds bring Indra, to our holy task.
Hither let thy Car-steeds who seek the sacrifice bring thee to our drink-offerings. {#4:14}

Pūṣan, the Lord of ample wealth, for firm alliance we elect.
May he with wisdom, Śakra! Looser! Much-invoked! aid us to riches and to seed. {#4:15}

Sharpen us like a razor in the barber's hands: send riches thou who settest free.
Easy to find with thee are treasures of the Dawn for mortal man whom thou dost speed. {#4:16}

Pūṣan, I long to win thy love, I long to praise thee, Radiant God.
Excellent Lord, ’tis strange tome, no wish have I to sing the psalm that Pajra sings. {#4:17}

My kine, O Radiant God, seek pasture where they will, my during wealth, Immortal One.
Be our protector, Pūṣan! be, most liberal Lord, propitious to our gathering strength. {#4:18}

Rich was the gift Kurunga gave, a hundred steeds at morning rites.
Among the gifts of Turvaśas we thought of him, the opulent, the splendid King. {#4:19}

What by his morning songs Kaṇva, the powerful, hath, with the Priyamedhas, gained- {#4:20}

The herds of sixty thousand pure and spotless kine, have I, the Ṛṣi, driven away. {#4:71}

The very trees were joyful at my coming: kine they obtained in plenty, steeds in plenty. {#4:21}

* * *

## HYMN V. Aśvins.

WHEN, even as she were present here, red Dawn hath shone from far away,
She spreadeth light on every side. {#5:1}

Like Heroes on your will-yoked car farshining, Wonder-Workers! ye
Attend, O Aśvins, on the Dawn. {#5:2}

By you, O Lords of ample wealth our songs of praise have been observed:
As envoy have I brought the prayer. {#5:3}

Kaṇvas must praise the Aśvins dear to many, making many glad,
Most rich, that they may succour us. {#5:4}

Most liberal, best at winning strength, inciters, Lords of splendour who
Visit the worshipper's abode. {#5:5}

So for devout Sudeva dew with fatness his unfailing mead,
And make it rich for sacrifice. {#5:6}

Hitherward running speedily with horses, as with rapid hawks,
Come, Aśvins, to our song of praise {#5:7}

Wherewith the three wide distances, and all the lights that are in heaven.
Ye traverse, and three times of night. {#5:8}

O Finders of the Day, that we may win us food of kine and wealth,
Open the paths for us to tread. {#5:9}

O Aśvins, bring us wealth in kine, in noble heroes, and in cars:
Bring us the strength that horses give. {#5:10}

Ye Lords of splendour, glorified, ye Wonder-Workers borne on paths
Of gold, drink sweets with Somajuice. {#5:11}

To us, ye Lords of ample wealth, and to our wealth chiefs extend
Wide shelter, ne’er to be assailed. {#5:12}

Come quickly downward to the prayer of people whom ye favour most:
Approach not unto other folk. {#5:13}

Ye Aśvins whom our minds perceive, drink of this lovely gladdening draught,
The mcath which we present to you. {#5:14}

Bring riches hither unto us in hundreds and in thousands, source
Of plenteous food, sustaining all. {#5:15}

Verily sages call on you, ye Heroes, in full many a place.
Moved by the priests, O Aśvins, conic. {#5:16}

Men who have trimmed the sacred grass, bringing oblations and prepared,
O Aśvins, are invoking you. {#5:17}

May this our hymn of praise to-day, most powerful to bring you, be,
O Aśvins, nearest to your hearts. {#5:18}

The skin filled full of savoury meath, laid in the pathway of your car-
O Aśvins, drink ye both therefrom. {#5:19}

For this, ye Lords of ample wealth, bring blessing for our herd, our kine,
Our progeny, and plenteous food. {#5:20}

Ye too unclose to us like doors the strengthening waters of the sky,
And rivers, ye who find the day. {#5:21}

When did the son of Tugra serve you, Men? Abandoned in the sea,
That with winged steeds your car might fly. {#5:22}

Ye, O Nāsatyas, ministered to Kaṇva with repeated aid,
When cast into the heated pit. {#5:23}

Come near with those most recent aids of yours which merit eulogy,
When I invoke you, Wealthy Gods. {#5:24}

As ye protected Kaṇva erst, Priyamedha and Upastuta,
Atri, Sinjara, Aśvins Twain {#5:25}

And Amsu in decisive fight, Agastya in the fray for kine.
And, in his battles, Sobhari. {#5:26}

For so much bliss, or even more, O Aśvins, Wealthy Gods, than this,
We pray white singing hymns to you. {#5:27}

Ascend your car with golden seat, O Aśvins, and with reins of gold,
That reaches even to the sky. {#5:28}

Golden is its supporting shaft, the axle also is of gold,
And both the wheels are made of gold. {#5:29}

Thereon, ye Lords of ample wealth, come to us even from afar,
Come ye to this mine eulogy. {#5:30}

From far away ye come to us, Aśvins, enjoying plenteous food
Of Dāsas, O Immortal Ones. {#5:31}

With splendour, riches, and renown, O Aśvins, hither come to us,
Nāsatyas, shining brilliantly. {#5:32}

May dappled horses, steeds who fly with pinions, bring you hitherward
To people skilled in sacrifice. {#5:33}

The whcel delayeth not that car of yours accompanied by song,
That cometh with a store of food. {#5:34}

Borne on that chariot wrought of gold, with coursers very fleet of foot,
Come, O Nāsatyas, swift as thought. {#5:35}

O Wealthy Gods, ye taste and find the brisk and watchful wild beast good.
Associate wealth with food for us. {#5:36}

As such, O Aśvins, find for me my share of new-presented gifts,
As Kasu, Cedi's son, gave me a hundred head of buffaloes, and ten thousand kine. {#5:37}

He who hath given me for mine own ten Kings like gold to look upon.
At Caidya's feet are all the people round about, all those who think upon the shield. {#5:38}

No man, not any, goes upon the path on which the Cedis walk.
No other prince, no folk is held more liberal of gifts than they. {#5:39}

## HYMN VI Indra

INDRA, great in his power and might, and like Parjanya rich in rain,
Is magnified by Vatsa's lauds. {#6:1}

When the priests, strengthening the Son of Holy Law, present their gifts,
Singers with Order's hymn of praiser. {#6:2}

Since Kaṇvas with their lauds have made Indra complete the sacrifice.
Words are their own appropriate arms. {#6:3}

Before his hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men, bow down,
As rivers bow them to the sea. {#6:4}

This power of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought together, like
A skin, the worlds of heaven and earth. {#6:5}

The fiercely-moving Vṛtra's head he severed with his thunderbolt,
His mighty hundred-knotted bolt. {#6:6}

Here are-we sing them loudly forth-our thoughts among-the best of songs.
Even lightnings like the blaze of fire. {#6:7}

When bidden thoughts, spontaneously advancing, glow, and with the stream
Of sacrifice the Kaṇvas shine. {#6:8}

Indra, may we obtain that wealth in horses and in herds of cows,
And prayer that may be noticed first. {#6:9}

I from my Father have received deep knowledge of the Holy Law
I was born like unto the Sun. {#6:10}

After the lore of ancient time I make, like Kaṇva, beauteous songs,
And Indra's selfgains strength thereby. {#6:11}

Whatever Ṛṣis have not praised thee, Indra, or have lauded thee,
By me exalted wax thou strong. {#6:12}

When his wrath thundered, when he rent Vṛtra to pieces, limb by limb,
He sent the waters to the sea. {#6:13}

Against the Dasyu gusna thou, Indra, didst hurl thy during bolt:
Thou, Dread one, hast a hero's fame. {#6:14}

Neither the heavens nor firmaments nor regions of the earth contain
Indra, the Thunderer with his might. {#6:15}

O Indra him who lay at length staying thy copious waters thou,
In his own footsteps, smotest down {#6:16}

Thou hiddest deep in darkness itim, O Indra, who had set his grasp
On spacious heaven and earth conjoined. {#6:17}

Indra, whatever Yatis and Bhṛgus have offered praise to thee,
Listen, thou Mighty, to my call. {#6:18}

Indra, these spotted cows yield thee their butter and the milky draught;
Aiders, thereby, of sacrifice; {#6:19}

Which, teeming, have received thee as a life-germ, Indra, with their mouth,
Like Sūrya who sustaineth all. {#6:20}

O Lord of Might, with hymns of praise the Kaṇvas have increased thy power,
The drops poured forth have strengthened thee. {#6:21}

Under thy guidance, Indra, mid thy praises, Lord of Thunder, shall
The sacrifice be soon performed. {#6:22}

Indra, disclose much food for us, like a stronghold with store of kine:
Give progeny and heroic strength. {#6:23}

And, Indra, grant us all that wealth of fleet steeds which shone bright of old
Among the tribes of Nahusas. {#6:24}

Hither thou seemest to attract heaven's fold which shines before our eyes,
When, Indra, thou art kind to us. {#6:25}

Yea, when thou puttest forth thy power, Indra, thou governest the folk.
Mighty, unlimited in strength. {#6:26}

The tribes who bring oblations call to thee, to thee to give them help,
With drops to thee who spreadest far. {#6:27}

There where the mountains downward slope, there by the meeting of the streams
The Sage was manifest with song. {#6:28}

Thence, marking, from his lofty place downward he looks upon the sea,
And thence with rapid stir he moves. {#6:29}

Then, verify, they see the light refulgent of primeval seed,
Kindled on yonder side of heaven. {#6:30}

Indra, the Kaṇvas all exalt thy wisdom and thy manly power,
And, Mightiest! thine heroic strength. {#6:31}

Accept this eulogy of mine, Indra, and guard me carefully:
Strengthen my thought and prosper it. {#6:32}

For thee, O Mighty, Thunder-armed, we singers through devotionhave
Fashioned the hymn that we may live. {#6:33}

To Indra have the Kaṇvas sung, like waters speeding down a slope:
The song is fain to go to him. {#6:34}

As rivers swell the ocean, so our hymns of praise make Indra strong,
Eternal, of resistIess wrath. {#6:35}

Come with thy lovely Bay Steeds, come to us from regions far away
O Indra, drink this Soma juice. {#6:36}

Best slayer of Vṛtras, men whose sacred grass is ready trimmed
Invoke thee for the gain of spoil. {#6:37}

The heavens and earth come after thee as the wheel follows Etaśa:
To thee flow Soma-drops effused. {#6:38}

Rejoice, O Indra, in the light, rejoice in Saryandyan, be Glad in the sacrificer's hymn. {#6:39}

Grown strong in heaven, the Thunder-armed hath bellowed, Vṛtra-slayer, Bull,
Chief drinker of the Soma juice. {#6:40}

Thou art a Ṛṣi born of old, sole Ruler over all by might:
Thou, Indra, guardest well our wealth. {#6:41}

May thy Bay Steeds with beauteous backs, a hundred, bring thee to the feast,
Bring thee to these our Soma-draughts. {#6:42}

The Kaṇvas with their hymns of praise have magnified this ancient thought
That swells with streams of meath and oil. {#6:43}

Mid mightiest Gods let mortal man choose Indra at the sacrifice,
Indra, whoe’er would win, for help. {#6:44}

Thy steeds, by Priyamedhas praised, shall bring thee, God whom all invoke,
Hither to drink the Somajuice. {#6:45}

A hundred thousand have I gained from Parsu, from Tirindira,
And presents of the Yadavas. {#6:46}

Ten thousand head of kine, and steeds three times a hundred they bestowed
On Pajra for the Sāma-song. {#6:47}

Kakuha hath reached up to heaven, bestowing buffaloes yoked in fours,
And matched in fame the Yadavas. {#6:48}

## HYMN VII. Maruts.

O MARUTS, when the sage hath poured the Tṛṣṭup forth as food for you,
Ye shine amid the mountain-clouds. {#7:1}

When, Bright Ones, fain to show your might ye have determined on your course,
The mountain-clouds have bent them down. {#7:2}

Loud roaring with the winds the Sons of Pṛśni have upraised themselves:
They have poured out the streaming food. {#7:3}

The Maruts spread the mist abroad and make mountains rock and reel,
When with the winds they go their way {#7:4}

What time the rivers and the hills before your coming bowed them down,
So to sustain your mighty force. {#7:5}

We call on you for aid by night, on you for succour in the day,
On you while sacrifice proceeds. {#7:6}

These, verily, wondrous, red of hue, speed on their courses with a roar
Over the ridges of the sky. {#7:7}

With might they drop the loosened rein so that the Sun may run his course,
And spread themselves with beams of light. {#7:8}

Accept, ye Maruts, this my song, accept ye this mine hymn of praise,
Accept, Ṛbhukṣans, this my call. {#7:9}

The dappled Cows have poured three lakes, meath for the Thunder-wielding God,
From the great cask, the watery cloud. {#7:10}

O Maruts, quickly come to us when, longing for felicity,
We call you hither from the sky. {#7:11}

For, Rudras and Ṛbhukṣans, ye, Most Bountiful, are in the house,
Wise when the gladdening draught is drunk. {#7:12}

O Maruts, send us down from heaven riches distilling rapturous joy,
With plenteous food, sustaining all. {#7:13}

When, Bright Ones, hither from the hills ye have resolved to take your way,
Ye revel in the drops effused. {#7:14}

Man should solicit with his lauds happiness which belongs to them,
So great a band invincible. {#7:15}

They who like fiery sparks with showers of rain blow through the heaven and earth,
Milking the spring that never fails. {#7:16}

With chariots and tumultuous roar, with tempests and with hymns of praise
The Sons of Pṛśni hurry forth. {#7:17}

For wealth, we think of that whereby ye aided Yadu, Turvaśa,
And KanVa who obtained the spoil. {#7:18}

May these our viands Bounteous Ones I that flow in streams like holy oil,
With Kaṇva's hymns, increase your might. {#7:19}

Where, Bounteous Lords for whom the grass is trimmed, are ye rejoicing now?
What Brahman is adoring you? {#7:20}

Is it not there where ye of old, supplied with sacred grass, for lauds
Inspired the strong in sacrifice? {#7:21}

They brought together both the worlds, the mighty waters, and the Sun,
And, joint by joint, the thunderbolt. {#7:22}

They sundered Vṛtra limb from limb and split the gloomy mountain-clouds,
Performing a heroic deed. {#7:23}

They reinforced the power and strength of Trita as he fought, and helped
Indra in battle with the foe. {#7:24}

They deck themselves for glory, bright, celestial, lightning in their hands,
And helms of gold upon their heads. {#7:25}

When eagerly ye from far away came to the cavern of the Bull,
He bellowed in his fear like Heaven. {#7:26}

Borne by your golden-footed steeds, O Gods, come hither to receive
The sacrifice we offer you. {#7:27}

When the red leader draws along their spotted deer yoked to the car.
The Bright Ones come, and shed the rain. {#7:28}

Susoma, Saryakiavan, and Arjika full of homes, have they.
These Heroes, sought with downward car. {#7:29}

When, Maruts, ye come to him, the singer who invokes you thus,
With favours to your suppliant? {#7:30}

What now? where have ye still a friend since ye left Indra all alone?
Who counteth on your friendship now? {#7:31}

The Kaṇvas sing forth Agni's praise together with our Maruts’ who
Wield thunder and wear swords of gold. {#7:32}

Hither for new felicity may I attract the Impetuous Ones,
The Heroes with their wondrous strength {#7:33}

Before them sink the very hills deerning themseives abysses: yea,
Even the mountains bend them down. {#7:34}

Steeds flying on their tortuous path through mid-air carry them, and give
The man who lauds them strength and life. {#7:35}

Agni was born the first of all, like Sūrya lovely with his light:
With lustre these have spread abroad. {#7:36}

## HYMN VIII. Aśvins.

Hail, Strengtheners of the praise-song speed onward, ye Heroes, with your thoughts. {#8:5}

As, Heroes, in the olden time the Ṛṣis called you to their aid,
So now, O Aśvins, come to us, come near to this mine eulogy. {#8:6}

Even from the luminous sphere of heaven come to us, ye who find the light,
Carers for Vatsa, through our prayers and lauds, O yewho hearour call. {#8:7}

Do others more than we adore the Aśvins with their hymns of praise?
The Ṛṣi Vatsa, Kaṇva's son, hath magnified you with his songs. {#8:8}

The holy singer with his hymns hath called you, Aśvins, hither-ward;
Best Vṛtra-slayers, free from stain, as such bring us felicity. {#8:9}

What time, ye Lords of ample wealth, the Lady mounted on your car,
Then, O ye Aśvins, ye attained all wishes that your hearts desired. {#8:10}

Come thence, O Aśvins, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments:
Vatsa the sage, the sage's son, hath sung a song of sweets to you. {#8:11}

Cheerers of many, rich in goods, discoverers of opulence,
The Aśvins, Riders through the sky, have welcomed this my song of praise. {#8:12}

O Aśvins, grant us all rich gifts wherewith no man mav interfere.
Make us observe the stated times: give us not over to reproach. {#8:13}

Whether, Nāsatyas, ye be nigh, or whether ye be far away,
Come thence, O Aśvins, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments. {#8:14}

Vatsa the Ṛṣi with his songs, Nāsatyas, hath exalted you:
Grant him rich food distilling oil, graced with a thousand ornaments. {#8:15}

Bestow on him, O Aśvins, food that strengthens, and that drops with oil,
On him who praises you for bliss, and, Lords of bounty, prays for wealth. {#8:16}

Come to us, ye who slay the foe, Lords of rich treasure, to this hymn.
O Heroes, give us high renown and these good things of earth for help. {#8:17}

The Priyamedhas have invoked you with all succours that are yours,
You, Aśvins, Lords of solemn rites, with calls entreating you to come. {#8:18}

Come to us, Aśvins, ye Who bring felicity, auspicious Ones,
To Vatsa who with prayer and hymn, lovers of song, hath honoured you. {#8:19}

Aid us, O Heroes, for those hymns for which ye helped GoSarya erst,
Gave Vaśa, Dasavraja aid, and Kaṇva and Medhatithi: {#8:20}

And favoured Trasadasyu, ye Heroes, in spoil-deciding fray:
For these, O Aśvins, graciously assist us in acquiring strength. {#8:21}

O Aśvins, may pure hymns of ours, and songs and praises, honour you:
Best slayers everywhere of foes, as such we fondly yearn for you. {#8:22}

Three places of the Aśvins, erst concealed, are made apparent now.
Both Sages, with the flight of Law come hither unto those who live. {#8:23}

* * *

## HYMN IX. Aśvins.

To help and favour Vatsa now, O Aśvins, come ye hitherward.
Bestow on him a dwelling spacious and secure, and keep malignities away. {#9:1}

All manliness that is in heaven, with the Five Tribes, or in mid-air,
Bestow, ye Aśvins, upon us. {#9:2}

Remember Kaṇva first of all among the singers, Aśvins, who
Have thought upon your wondrous deeds. {#9:3}

Aśvins, for you with song of praise this hot oblation is effused,
This your sweet Soma juice, ye Lords of ample wealth, through which ye think upon the foe. {#9:4}

Whatever ye have done in floods, in the tree, Wonder-Workers, and in growing plants,
Therewith, O Aśvins, succour me. {#9:5}

What force, Nāsatyas, ye exert, whatever, Gods, ye tend and heal,
This your own Vatsa gains not by his hymns alone: ye visit him who offers gifts. {#9:6}

Now hath the Ṛṣi splendidly thought out the Aśvins' hymn of praise.
Let the Atharvan pour the warm oblation forth, and Soma very rich in sweets. {#9:7}

Ye Aśvins, now ascend your car that lightly rolls upon its way.
May these my praises make you speed hitherward like a cloud of heaven. {#9:8}

When, O Nāsatyas, we this day make you speed hither with our hymns,
Or, Aśvins, with our songs of praise, remember Kanya specially. {#9:9}

As erst Kakṣīvān and the Ṛṣi Vyaśva, as erst Dīrghatamas invoked your presence,
Or, in the sacrificial chambers, Vainya Pṛthi, so be ye mindful of us here, O Aśvins. {#9:10}

Come as home-guardians, saving us from foemen, guarding our living creatures and our bodies,
Come to the house to give us seed and offspring, {#9:11}

Whether with Indra ye be faring, Aśvins, or resting in one dwelling-place with Vāyu,
In concord with the Ṛbhus or Ādityas, or standing still in Viṣṇu's striding-places. {#9:12}

When I, O Aśvins, call on you to-day that I may gather strength,
Or as all-conquering might in war, be that the Aśvins' noblest grace. {#9:13}

Now come, ye Aśvins, hitherward: here are oblations set for you;
These Soma-draughts to aid Yadu and
Turvaśa, these offered you mid Kaniva's Sons. {#9:14}

Whatever healing balm is yours, Nisatyas, near or far away,
Therewith, great Sages, grant a home to Vatsa and to Vimada. {#9:15}

Together with the Goddess, with the Aśvins' Speech have I awoke.
Thou, Goddess, hast disclosed the hymn, and holy gift from mortal men. {#9:16}

Awake the Aśvins, Goddess Dawn! Up Mighty Lady of sweet strains!
Rise, straightway, priest of sacrifice! High glory to the gladdening draught! {#9:17}

Thou, Dawn, approaching with thy light shinest together with the Sun,
And to this man-protecting home the chariot ofthe Aśvins comes. {#9:18}

When yellow stalks give forth the juice, as cows from udders pour their milk,
And voices sound the song of praise, the Aśvins' worshippers show first. {#9:19}

Forward for glory and for strength, protection that shall conquer men,
And power and skill, most sapient Ones! {#9:20}

When Aśvins, worthy of our lauds, ye seat you in the father's house.
With wisdom or the bliss ye bring. {#9:21}

With whom our friendship is most famed, and kinship passing that of Gods. {#10:3}

On whom the solemn rites depend, whose worshippers rise without the Sun:
These who foreknow the holy work of sacrifice, and by their Godhead drink the sweets of Soma juice. {#10:4}

With Druhyu, or with Anu, Yadu, Turvaga, I call you hither; come to me. {#10:5}

Hast won all treasures for thine own. {#14:6}

In Soma's ecstasy Indra spread the firmament and realms of light,
When he cleft Vala limb from limb. {#14:7}

And Vala he cast headlong down. {#14:8}

By Indra were the lumirious realms of heaven established and secured,
Firm and immovable from their place. {#14:9}

Strong for the gain of mighty spoil. {#16:3}

Whose perfect ecstasies are wide, profound, victorious, and give
joy in the field where heroes win. {#16:4}

With hymns and sacred eulogies {#16:9}

And quells their foemen in the fray. {#16:10}

May he, the saviour much-invoked, may Indra bear us in a ship
Safely beyond all enemies. {#16:11}

As such, O Indra, honour us with gifts of booty, further us,
And lead us to felicity. {#16:12}

COME, we have pressed the juice for thee; O Indra, drink this Soma here
Sit thou on this my sacred grass. {#17:1}

O Indra, let thy long-maned Bays, yoked by prayer, bring thee hitherward
Give car and listen to our prayers. {#17:2}

We Soma-bearing Brahmans call thee Soma-drinker with thy friend,
We, Indra, bringing Soma juice. {#17:3}

Come unto us who bring the juice, come unto this our eulogy,
Fair-visored! drink thou of the juice. {#17:4}

I pour it down within thee, so through all thy members let it spread:
Take with. thy tongue the pleasant drink. {#17:5}

Sweet to thy body let it be, delicious be the savoury juice:
Sweet be the Soma to thine heart. {#17:6}

Like women, let this Soma-draught, invested with its robe, approach,
O active Indra, close to thee. {#17:7}

Indra, transported with the juice, vast in his bulk, strong in his neck
And stout arms, smites the Vṛtras down. {#17:8}

O Indra, go thou forward, thou who rulest over all by might:
Thou Vṛtra-slayer slay the fiends, {#17:9}

Long be thy grasping-hook wherewith thou givest ample wealth to him
Who sheds the juice and worships thee. {#17:10}

Here, Indra, is thy Soma-draught, made pure upon the sacred grass:
Run hither, come and drink thereof. {#17:11}

Famed for thy radiance, worshipped well this juice is shed for thy delight
Thou art invoked, Akhandala! {#17:12}

To Kundapayya, grandson's son, grandson of Srngavrs! to thee,
To him have I addressed my thought. {#17:13}

Strong pillar thou, Lord of the home armour of Soma-offerers:
The drop of Soma breaketh all the strongholds down, and Indra is the Ṛṣis’ Friend. {#17:14}

Lead on the wild horse Indra with his vigorous grasp forward to drink the Soma juice. {#17:15}

Now let the mortal offer prayer to win the unexampled grace
Of these Ādityas and their aid to cherish life. {#18:1}

For not an enemy molests the paths which these Ādityas tread:
Infallible guards, they strengthen us in happiness. {#18:2}

Now soon may Bhaga, Savitar, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman
Give us the shelter widely spread which we implore. {#18:3}

With Gods come thou whose fostering care none checks, O Goddesss Aditi:
Come, dear to many, with the Lords who guard us well. {#18:4}

For well these Sons of Aditi know to keep enmities aloof,
Unrivalled, giving ample room, they save from woe. {#18:5}

Aditi guard our herd by day, Aditi, free from guile, by night,
Aditi, ever strengthening, save us from grief! {#18:6}

And in the day our hymn is this: May Aditi come nigh to help,
With loving-kindness bring us weal and chase our foes. {#18:7}

And may the Aśvins, the divine Pair of Physicians, send us health:
May they remove iniquity and chase our foes. {#18:8}

May Agni bless us with his fires, and Sūrya warm us pleasantly:
May the pure Wind breathe sweet on us, and chase our foes. {#18:9}

Drive ye disease and strife away, drive ye away malignity:
Ādityas, keep us ever far from sore distress. {#18:10}

Remove from us the arrow, keep famine, Ādityas! far away:
Keep enmities afar from us, Lords of all wealth! {#18:11}

Now, O Ādityas, grant to us the shelter that lets man go free,
Yea, even the sinner from his sin, ye Bounteous Gods 1 {#18:12}

Whatever mortal with the powe r of demons fain would injure us,
May he, impetuous, suffer harm by his own deeds. {#18:13}

May sin o’ertake our human foe, the man who speaketh evil thing,
Him who would cause our misery, whose heart is false. {#18:14}

Gods, ye are with the simple ones, ye know each mortal in your hearts;
Ye, Vasus, well discriminate the false and true. {#18:15}

Fain would we have the sheltering aid of mountains and of water-floods:
Keep far from us iniquity, O Heaven and Earth. {#18:16}

So with auspicious sheltering aid do ye, O Vasus, carry us
Beyond all trouble and distress, borne in your ship. {#18:17}

Ādityas, ye Most Mighty Ones, grant to our children and their seed
Extended term of life that they may live long days. {#18:18}

Sacrifice, O Ādityas, is your inward monitor: be kind,
For in the bond of kindred we are bound to you. {#18:19}

The Maruts’ high protecting aid, the Aśvins, and the God who saves,
Mitra and Varuṇa for weal we supplicate. {#18:20}

Grant us a home with triple guard, Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa!
Unthreatened, Maruts! meet for praise, and filled with men. {#18:21}

And as we human beings, O Ādityas, are akin to death,
Graciously lengthen ye our lives that we may live. {#18:22}

And sent oblation to Gods. {#19:1}

Agni, the Bounteous Giver, bright with varied flames, laud thou, O singer Sobhari-
Him who controls this sacred food with Soma blent, who hath first claim to sacrifice. {#19:2}

Thee have we chosen skilftillest in sacrifice, Immortal Priest among the Gods,
Wise finisher of this holy rite: {#19:3}

The Son of Strength, the blessed, brightly shining One, Agni whose light is excellent.

The mortal who hath ministered to Agni with oblation, fuel, ritual lore,
And reverence, skilled in sacrifice. {#19:5}

Verily swift to run are his fleet-footed steeds, and most resplendent fame is his.
No trouble caused by Gods or wrought by mortal man from any side o’ertaketh him. {#19:6}

May we by thine own fires be well supplied with fire, O Son of Strength, O Lord of Might:
Thou as our Friend hast worthy men. {#19:7}

Agni, who praises like a guest of friendly mind, is as a car that brings us gear.
Also in thee is found perfect security thou art the Sovran Lord of wealth. {#19:8}

That man, moreover, merits praise who brings, auspicious Agni, sacrificial gifts
May he win riches by his thoughts. {#19:9}

He for whose sacrifice thou standest up erect is prosperous and rules o’er men.
He wins with coursers and with singers killed in song: with heroes he obtains the prize. {#19:10}

He in whose dwelling Agni is chief ornament, and, all-desired, loves his laud well,
And zealously tends his offerings- {#19:11}

His, or the lauding sage's word, his, Son of Strength! who Is most prompt with sacred gifts,
Set thou beneath the Gods, Vasu, above mankind, the speech of the intelligent. {#19:12}

He who with sacrificial gifts or homage bringeth very skilful Agni nigh,
Or him who flashes fast with song, {#19:13}

The mortal who with blazing fuel, as his laws command, adores the Perfect God,

Give us the splendour, Agni, which may overcome each greedy fiend in our abode,
The wrath of evil-hearted folk. {#19:15}

That may we, by thy power finding best furtherance, worship, O Indra, helped by thee. {#19:16}

O Agni, most devout are they, the sages who have set thee Sage exceeding wise,
O God, for men to look upon: {#19:17}

Who have arranged thine altar Blessed God, at morn brought thine oblation, pressed the juice.
They by their deeds of strength have won diem, mighty wealth, who have set all their hope in thee. {#19:18}

-May Agni worshipped bring us bliss, may the gift, Blessed One, and sacrifice bring bliss;
Yea, may our praises bring us bliss. {#19:19}

Show forth the mind that brings success in war with fiends, wherewith thou conquerest in fight.
Bring down the many firm hopes of our enemies, and let us vanquish with thine aid. {#19:20}

I praise with song the Friend of man, whom Gods sent down to be herald and messenger,
Best worshipper, bearer of our gifts. {#19:21}

Thou unto sharp-toothed Agni, Young and Radiant God, proclaimest with thy song the feast-
Agni, who for our sweet strains moulds heroic strength when sacred oil is offered him, {#19:22}

While, served with sacrificial oil, now upward and now downward Agni moves his sword,
As doth the Asura his robe. {#19:23}

The God, the Friend of man, who bears our gifts to heaven, the God with his sweet-smelling mouth,
Distributes, skilled in sacrifice, his precious things, Invoking Priest, Immortal God. {#19:24}

Son of Strength, Agni, if thou wert the mortal, bright as Mitra, I worshipped with our gifts!
And I were the Immortal God {#19:25}

I would not give thee up, Vasu, to calumny, or misery, O Bounteous One.
My worshipper should feel no hunger or distress, nor, Agni, should he live in sin. {#19:26}

Like a son cherished in his father's houi§e, let our oblation rise unto the Gods. {#19:27}

With thine immediate aid may I, excellent Agni, ever gain my wish
A mortal with a God to help. {#19:28}

O Agni, by thy wisdom, by thy bounties, by thy leading may I gather wealth.
Excellent Agni, thou art called my Providence: delight thou to be liberal. {#19:29}

Agni, he conquers by thine aid that brings him store of noble heroes and great strength,
Whose bond of friendship is thy choice. {#19:30}

Thy spark is black and crackling, kindled in due time, O Bounteous, it is taken up.
Thou art the dear Friend of the mighty Mornings: thou shinest in glimmerings of the night. {#19:31}

We Sobharis have come to him, for succour, who is good to help with thousand powers,
The Sovran, Trasadasyu's Friend. {#19:32}

O Agni, thou on whom all other fires depend, as branches on the parent stem,
I make the treasures of the folk, like songs, mine own, while I exalt thy sovran might. {#19:33}

The mortal whom, Ādityas, ye, Guilelew, lead to the farther bank
Of all the princes, Bounteous Ones {#19:34}

Whoe’er he be, Man-ruling Kings! the Regent of the race of men-
May we, O Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman, like him be furtherers of your law. {#19:35}

A gift of fifty female slaves hath Trasadasyu given me, Purukutsa's son,
Most liberal, kind, lord of the brave. {#19:36}

And Śyāva too for me led forth a strong steed at Suvastu's ford:
A herd of three times seventy kine, good lord of gifts, he gave to me. {#19:37}

## HYMN XX Maruts.

LET none, Swift Travellers! check you: come hither, like-spirited, stay not far away,
Ye benders even of what is firm. {#20:1}

Maruts, Ṛbhukṣans, Rudras come ye with your cars strong-fellied and exceeding bright.
Come, ye for whom we long, with food, to sacrifice, come ye with love to Sobbari. {#20:2}

For well we know the vigorous might of Rudra's Sons, the Martits, who are passing strong,
Swift Viṣṇu's band, who send the rain., {#20:3}

Islands are bursting forth and misery is stayed: the heaven and earth are joined in one.
Decked with bright rings, ye spread the broad expanses out, when ye, Self. luminous, stirred yourselves. {#20:4}

Even things immovable shake and reel, the mountains and the forest trees at your approach,
And the earth trembles as ye come. {#20:5}

To lend free course, O Maruts, to your furious rush, heaven high and higher still gives way,
Where they, the Heroes mighty with their arms, display their gleaming omaments on their forms. {#20:6}

After their Godlike nature they, the bull. like Heroes, dazzling and impetuous, wear
Great splendour as they show erect. {#20:7}

The pivot of the Sobharis' chariot within the golden box is balmed with milk.
May they the Well-born, Mighty, kindred of the Cow, aid us to food and to delight. {#20:8}

Bring, ye who sprinkle balmy drops. oblations to your vigorous Marut company,
To those whose leader is the Bull. {#20:9}

Come hither, O ye Mares, on your stronghorsed car, solid in look, with solid naves.
Lightly like winged falcons, O ye Heroes, come, come to enjoy our ofrerings. {#20:10}

Their decoration is the same: their omaments of gold are bright upon their arms;
Their lances glitter splendidly. {#20:11}

They toil not to defend their bodies from attack, strong Heroes with their mighty arms.
Strong are your bows and strong the weapons in your cars, and glory sits on every face. {#20:12}

Whose name extendeth like a sea, alone, resplendent, so that all have joy in it,
And life-power like ancestral might. {#20:13}

Pay honour to these Maruts and sing praise to them, for of the wheel-spokes of the car
Of these loud roarers none is last: this is their power, this moves them to give mighty gifts. {#20:14}

Blest by your favouring help was he, O Maruts, at the earlier flushings of the morn,
And even now shall he be blest. {#20:15}

The strong man to whose sacrifice, O Heroes, ye approach that ye may taste thereof,
With glories and with war that winneth spoil shall gain great bliss, ye Shakers of the world. {#20:16}

Even as Rudra's Sons, the brood of the Creator Dyaus, the Asura, desire,
O Youthful Ones, so shall it be: {#20:17}

And these the bounteous, worthy of the Maruts who move onward pouring down the rain-
Even for their sake, O Youthful Ones, with kindest heart take us to you to be your own. {#20:18}

O Sobhari, with newest song sing out unto the youthful purifying Bulls,
Even as a plougher to his steers. {#20:19}

Who, like a celebrated boxer, overcome the challengers in every fight:
They who, like shining bulls, are most illustrious-honour those Maruts with thy song. {#20:20}

Allied by common ancestry, ye Maruts, even the Cows, alike in energy,
Lick, all by turns, each other's head. {#20:21}

Even mortal man, ye Dancers breast adorned with gold, attains to brotherhood with you.
Mark ye and notice us, O Maruts; evermore your friendship is secured to us. {#20:22}

O Maruts, rich in noble gifts, bring us a portion of the Maruts’ medicine,
Ye Coursers who are Friends to us. {#20:23}

Haters of those who serve you not, bliss-bringers, bring us bliss with those auspicious aids
Wherewith ye are victorious and guard Sindhu well, and succour Krvi in his need. {#20:24}

Maruts, who rest on fair trimmed grass, what balm soever Sindhu or Asikni hath,
Or mountains or the seas contain. {#20:25}

Ye carry on your bodies, ye who see it all: so bless us graciously therewith.
Cast, Maruts, to the ground our sick man's malady: replace the dislocated limb. {#20:26}

## HYMN XXI. Indra.

WE call on thee, O Matchless One! We seeking help, possessing nothing firm ourselves,
Call on thee wonderful in fight {#21:1}

On thee for aid in sacrifice. This youth of ours, the bold, the mighty, hath gonse forth.
We therefore, we thy friends, Indra, havie chosen thee, free-giver, as our Guardian God. {#21:2}

Come hither, for the drops are here, O Lord of corn-lands. Lord of horses, Lord of kine:
Drink thou the Soma, Soma's Lord! {#21:3}

For we the kinless singers have drawn hither thee, O Indra, who hast numerous kin.
With all the forms thou hast, comic thou of bull-like strength, come near to drink the Soma juice. {#21:4}

Sitting like birds beside thy meath., mingled with milk, that gladdeneth and exalteth thee,
Indra, to thee we sing aloud. {#21:5}

We speak to thee with this our reverential prayer. Why art thou pondering yet awhile?
Here are our wishes; thou art liberal, Lord of Bays: we and our hymns are present here. {#21:6}

For not in recent times alone, O Indra, Thunder-armed, have we obtained thine aid.
Of old we knew thy plenteous wealth. {#21:7}

Hero, we knew thy friendship and thy rich rewards: these, Thunderer, now we crave of thee.
O Vasu, for all wealth that cometh of the kine, sharpen our powers, fair-visored God. {#21:8}

Him who of old hath brought to us this and that blessing, him I magnify for you,
Even Indra, O my friends, for help {#21:9}

Borne by Bay Steeds, the Lord of heroes, ruling men, for it is he who takes; delight.
May Maghavan bestow on us his worshippers hundreds of cattle and of steeds. {#21:10}

Hero, may we, with thee for Friend, withstand the man who pants against us in his wrath,
In fight with people rich in kine. {#21:11}

May we be victors in the singer's battlesong, and meet the wicked, Much invoked!
With heroes smite the foeman and show forth our strength. O Indra, further thou our thoughts. {#21:12}

O Indra, from all ancient time rivalless ever and companionless art thou:
Thou seekest comradeship in war. {#21:13}

Thou findest not the wealthy man to be thy friend: those scorn thee who are flown with wine.
What time thou thunderest and gatherest, then thou, even as a Father, art invoked. {#21:14}

O Indra, let us not, like fools who waste their lives at home, with friendship such as thine
Sit idly by the poured-out juice. {#21:15}

Giver of kine, may we not miss thy gracious gifts: let us not rob thee of thine own.
Strip even the strong places of the foe, and bring: thy gifts can never be made vain. {#21:16}

Indra or blest Sarasvatī alone bestows such wealth, treasure so great, or thou,
O Citra, on the worshipper. {#21:17}

Citra is King, and only kinglings are the rest who dwell beside Sarasvatī.
He, like Parjanya with his rain, hath spread himself with thousand, yea, with myriad gifts. {#21:18}

HITHERWARD have I called to-day, for succour, that most wondrous car
Which ye ascended, Aśvins, ye whose paths are red, swift to give Car, for Sūrya's sake. {#22:1}

Car ever young, much longed-for, easily invoked, soon guided, first in deeds of might,
Which waits and serves, O Sobhari, with benevolence, without a rival or a foe. {#22:2}

These Aśvins with our homage, these Two Omnipresent Deities
Hitherward will we bring for kind help, these who seek the dwelling of the worshipper. {#22:3}

One of your chariot wheels is moving swiftly round, one speeds for you its onward course.
Like a milch-cow, O Lords of splendour, and with haste let your benevolence come to us. {#22:4}

That chariot of yours which hath a triple seat and reins of gold,
The famous car that traverseth the heaven and earth, thereon Nāsatyas, Aśvins, come. {#22:5}

Ye with your plough, when favouring Manu with your help, ploughed the first harvest in the sky.
As such will we exalt you, Lords of splendour, now, O Aśvins, with our prayer and praise. {#22:6}

Come to us, Lords of ample wealth, by paths of everlasting Law,
Whereby to high dominion ye with mighty strength raised Trksi, Trasadasyu's son. {#22:7}

This Soma pressed with stones is yours, ye Heroes, Lords of plenteous wealth.
Approach to drink the Soma, come, drink in the worshipper's abode. {#22:8}

O Aśvins, mount the chariot, mount the golden seat, ye who are Lords of plenteous wealth,
And bring to us abundant food. {#22:9}

The aids wherewith ye helped Paktha and Adhrigt;, and Babhru severed from his friends,—
With those, O Aśvins, come hither with speed and soon, and heal whatever is diseased. {#22:10}

When we continually invoke the Aśvins, the resistless, at this time of day,
We lovers of the song, with songs. {#22:11}

Through these, ye Mighty Ones, come hither to my call which brings all blessings, wears all forms,—
Tlirough which, All-present Heroes, lavishest of food ye strengthened Krvi, come through these. {#22:12}

I speak to both of these as such, these Aśvins whom I reverence at this time of day:
With homage we entreat them both. {#22:13}

Ye who are Lords of splendour, ye whose paths are red, at eve, at mom, at sacrifice,
Give us not utterly as prey to mortal foe, ye Rudras, Lords of ample wealth. {#22:14}

For bliss I call. the blissful car, at morn the inseparable Aśvins with their car
I call, like Sobhari our sire. {#22:15}

Rapid as thought, and strong, and speeding to thejoy, bringing.your swiftly-coming help,
Be to us a protection even from far away Lords of great wealth, with many aids.' {#22:16}

Come, Wonder-Workers, to our home, our home, O Aśvins, rich in cattle, steeds, and gold,
Chief drinkers of the Soma's juice {#22:17}

Kind as a friend to men who keep the holy Law. {#23:8}

Him, true to Law, who perfecteth the sacrifice,. Law-loving ones!
Ye with your song have gratified in the place of prayer. {#23:9}

May all our sacrifices go to him the truest Aṅgiras,
Who is among mankind the most illustrious Priest. {#23:10}

Imperishable Agni, thine are all these high enkindled lights,
Like horses and like stallions showing forth their strength. {#23:11}

So give us, Lord of Power and Might, riches combined with hero strength,
And guard us with our sons and grand. sons in our frays. {#23:12}

Soon as the eager Lord of men is friendly unto Manti's race,
Agni averteth from us all the demon host. {#23:13}

Burn down the Rākṣasas, enchanters, with thy flame. {#23:14}

None certairdy like thee in goodness and in wealth. {#24:15}

O ministering priest, pour out of the sweet juice what gladdens most:
So is the Hero praised who ever prospers us. {#24:16}

Indra, whom Tawny Coursers bear, praise such as thine, preeminent,
None by his power or by his goodness hath attained. {#24:17}

We, seeking glory, have invoked this Master of all power and might
Who must be glorified by constant sacri fice. {#24:18}

Come, sing we praise to Indra, friends, the Hero who deserves the laud,
Him who with none to aid o’ercomes all tribes of men. {#24:19}

To him who wins the kine, who keeps no cattle back, Celestial God,
Speak wondrous speech more sweet than butter and than meath. {#24:20}

Whose hero powers are measureless, whose bounty ne’er may be surpassed,
Whose liberality, like light, is over all. {#24:21}

As Vyaśva did, praise Indra, praise the Strong unfluctuating Guide,
Who gives the foe's possessions to the worshipper. {#24:22}

Now, son of Vyaśva, praise thou him who to the tenth time still is new,
The very Wise, whom living men must glorify {#24:23}

Thou knowest, Indra, Thunder-armed, how to avoid destructive powers,
As one secure from pitfalls each returning day. {#24:24}

O Indra, bring that aid wherewith of old, Most Wondrous! thou didst slay
His foes for active Kutsa: send it down to us. {#24:25}

So now we seek thee fresh in might, Most Wonderful in act! for gain:
For thou art he who conquers all our foes for us. {#24:26}

Who will set free from ruinous woe, or Ārya on the Seven Streams:
O valiant Hero, bend the Dāsa's weapon down. {#24:27}

As to Varosusaman thou broughtest great riches, for their gain,
To Vyaśva's sons, Blest Lady, rich in ample wealth! {#24:28}

Let Narya's sacrificial meed reach Vyaśva's Soma-bearing sons:
In hundreds and in thousands be the great reward. {#24:29}

If one should ask thee, Where is he who sacrificed? Whither lookest thou?
Like Vala he hath passed away and dwelleth now on Gomati. {#24:30}

* * *

## HYMN XXV. Mitra-Varuṇa.

I WORSHIP you who guard this All, Gods, holiest among the Gods,
You, faithful to the Law, whose power is sanctified. {#25:1}

So, too, like charioteers are they, Mitra and sapient Varuṇa,
Sons high-born from of old, whose holy laws stand fast. {#25:2}

These Twain, possessors of all wealth, most glorious, for supremest sway
Aditi, Mighty Mother, true to Law, brought forth. {#25:3}

Great Varuṇa and Mitra, Gods, Asuras and imperial Lords,
True to Eternal Law proclaim the high decree. {#25:4}

The offspring of a lofty Power, Dakṣa's Two Sons exceeding strong,
Who, Lords of flowing rain, dwell in the place of food. {#25:5}

Ye who have gathered up your gifts, celestial and terrestrial food,
Let your rain come to us fraught with the mist of heaven. {#25:6}

The Twain, who from the lofty sky seem to look down on herds below,
Holy, imperial Lords, are set to be revered. {#25:7}

They, true to Law, exceeding strong, have sat them down for savran rule:
Princes whose laws stand fast, they have obtained their sway. {#25:8}

Pathfinders even better than the eye, with unobstructed sight,
Even when they close their lids, observant, they perceive. {#25:9}

So may the Goddess Aditi, may the Nāsatyas guard us well,
The Martits guard us well,.endowed with mighty strength. {#25:10}

Do ye, O Bounteous Gods, protect our dwelling lace by day and night:
With you for our defenders may we go unharmed. {#25:11}

May we, unharmed, serve bountiful Viṣṇu, the God who slayeth none:
Self-moving Sindhu hear and be the first to mark. {#25:12}

This sure protection we elect, desirable and reaching far,
Which Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman afford. {#25:13}

And may the Sindhu of the floods, the Maruts, and the ASvin Pair,
Boon Indra, and boon Viṣṇu have one mind with us. {#25:14}

Because these warring Heroes stay the enmity of every foe,
As the fierce water-flood repels the furious ones. {#25:15}

Here this one God, the Lord of men, looks forth exceeding far and wide:
And we, for your advantage, keep his holy laws. {#25:16}

We keep the old accustomed laws, the statutes of supremacy,
The Iong-known laws of Mitra and of Varuṇa. {#25:17}

He who hath measured with his ray the boundaries of heaven and earth,
And with his majesty hath filled the two worlds full, {#25:18}

Sūrya hath spread his light aloft up to the region of the sky,
Like Agni all aflame when gifts are offered him. {#25:19}

With him who sits afar the word is lord of food that comes from kine,
Controller of the gift of unempoisoned food. {#25:20}

So unto Sūrya, Heaven, and Earth at morning and at eve I speak.
Bringing enjoyments ever rise thou up for us. {#25:21}

From Uksanyayana a bay, from Harayana a white steed,
And from Susaman we obtained a hamessed car. {#25:22}

These two shall bring me further gain of troops of tawny-coloured steeds,
The carriers shall they be of active men of war. {#25:23}

And the two sages have I gained who hold the reins and bear the whip,
And the two great strong coursers, with my newest song. {#25:24}

* * *

## HYMN XXVI. Aśvins.

I CALL your chariot to receive united praise mid princely men,
Strong Gods who pour down wealth, of never vanquished might! {#26:1}

Ye to Varosusaman come, Nāsatyas, for this glorious rite.
With your protecting aid. Strong Gods, who pour down wealth. {#26:2}

So with oblations we invoke you, rich in ample wealth, to-day,
When night hath passed, O ye who send us plenteous food.
O Aśvins, Heroes, let your car, famed, best to travel, come to us,
And, for his glory, mark your zealous servant's lauds. {#26:3}

Aśvins, who send us precious gifts, even when offended, think of him:
For ye, O Rudras, lead us safe beyond our foes. {#26:5}

For, Wonder-Workers, with fleet steeds ye fly completely round this All,
Stirring our thoughts, ye Lords of splendour, honey-hued. {#26:6}

With all-sustaining opulence, Aśvins, come hitherward to us,
Ye rich and noble Heroes, ne’er to be o’erthrown. {#26:7}

To welcome this mine offering, O ye Indra-like Nāsatyas, come
As Gods of best accord this day with other Gods. {#26:8}

For we, like Vyaśva, lifting up our voice like oxen, call on you:
With all your loving kindness, Sages, come to us. {#26:9}

O Ṛṣi, laud the Aśvins well. Will they not listen to thy call?
Will they not burn the Paṇis who are nearer them? {#26:10}

O Heroes, listen to the son of Vyaśva, and regard me here,
Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, of one accord. {#26:11}

Gods whom we yearn for, of your gifts, of what ye bring to us, bestow
By princes' hands on me, ye Mighty, day by day. {#26:12}

Him whom your sacrifices clothe, even as a woman with her robe,
The Aśvins help to glory honouring him well. {#26:13}

Whoso regards your care of men as succour widest in its reach,
About his dwelling go, ye Aśvins, loving us. {#26:14}

Come to us ye who pour down wealth, come to the home which men must guard:
Like shafts, ye are made meet for sacrifice by song. {#26:15}

Most fetching of all calls, the laud, as envoy, Heroes, called to you
Be it your own, O Aśvin Pair. {#26:16}

Be ye in yonder sea of heaven, or joying in the home of food,
Listen to me, Immortal Ones. {#26:17}

This river with his lucid flow attracts you, more than all the streams,—
Even Sindhu with his path of gold. {#26:18}

O Aśvins, with that glorious fame come hither, through our brilliant song,
Come ye whose ways are marked with light. {#26:19}

Harness the steeds who draw the car, O Vasu, bring the well-fed pair.
O Vāyu, drink thou of our meath: come unto our drink-offerings. {#26:20}

Wonderful Vāyu, Lord of Right, thou who art Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law,
Thy saving succour we elect. {#26:21}

To Tvaṣṭar's son-in-law we pray for wealth whereof he hath control:
For glory we seek vayu, men with juice effused. {#26:22}

From heaven, auspicious Vāyu, come drive hither with thy noble steeds:
Come on thy mighty car with wide-extending seat. {#26:23}

We call thee to the homes of men, thee wealthiest in noble food,
And liberal as a press-stone with a horse's back. {#26:24}

So, glad and joyful in thine heart, do thou, God, Vāyu, first of all
Vouchsafe us water, strength, and thought. {#26:25}

* * *

## HYMN XXVII. Viśvedevas.

CHEIF Priest is Agni at the laud, as stones and grass at sacrifice:
With song I seek the Maruts, Brahmaṇaspati, Gods for help much to be desired. {#27:1}

I sing to cattle and to Earth, to trees, to Dawns, to Night, to plants.
O all ye Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, be ye the furtherers of our thoughts. {#27:2}

Forth go, with Agni, to the Gods our sacrifice of ancient use,
To the Ādityas, Varuṇa whose Law stands fast, and the all-lightening Marut troop. {#27:3}

Lords of all wealth, may they be strengtheners of man, destroyers of his enemies.
Lords of all wealth, do ye, with guards which none may harm, preserve our dwelling free from foes. {#27:4}

Come to us with one mind to-day, come to us all with one accord,
Maruts with holy song, and, Goddess Aditi, Mighty One, to our house and home. {#27:5}

Send us delightful things, ye Maruts, on your steeds: come ye, O Mitra, to our gifts.
Let Indra, Varuṇa, and the Ādityas sit, swift Heroes, on our sacred grass. {#27:6}

We who have trimmed the grass for you, and set the banquet in array,
And pressed the Soma, call you, Varuina, like men, with sacrificial fires aflame. {#27:7}

O Maruts, Visinu, Aśvins, Pūṣan, haste away with minds turned hitherward to Me.
Let the Strong Indra, famed as Vṛtra's slayer, come first with the winners of the spoil. {#27:8}

Ye Guileless Gods, bestow on us a refuge strong on every side,
A sure protection, Vasus, unassailable from near at hand or from afar. {#27:9}

Kinship have I with you, and close alliance O ye Gods, destroyers of our foes.
Call us to our prosperity of former days, and soon to new klicity. {#27:10}

For now have I sent forth to you, that I may win a fair reward,
Lords of all wealth, with homage, this my song of praise. like a milch-cow that faileth not. {#27:11}

Excellent Savitar hath mounted up on high for you, ye sure and careful Guides.
Bipeds and quadrupeds, with several hopes and aims, and birds have settled to their tasks. {#27:12}

Singing their praise with God-like thought let us invoke each God for grace,
Each God to bring you help, each God to strengthen you. {#27:13}

For of one spirit are the Gods with mortal man, co-sharers all of gracious gifts.
May they increase our strength hereafter and to-day, providing case and ample room. {#27:14}

I laud you, O ye Guileless Gods, here where we meet to render praise.
None, Varuṇa and Mitra, harins the mortal, man who honours and obeys your laws. {#27:15}

He makes his house endure, he gathers plenteous food who pays obedience to your will.
Born in his sons anew he spreads as Law commands, and prospers every way unharmed. {#27:16}

E’en without war he gathers wealth, and goes hisway on pleasant paths,
Whom Mitra, Varuṇa and Aryaman protect, sharing the gift,of one accord. {#27:17}

E’en on the plain for him ye make a sloping path, an easy way where road is none:
And far away from him the ineffectual shaft must vanish, shot at him in vain. {#27:18}

If ye appoint the rite to-day, kind Rulers, when the Sun ascends,
Lords of all wealth, at sunset or at wakingtime, or be it at the noon of day, {#27:19}

Or, Asuras, when ye have sheltered the worshipper who goes to sacrifice, at eve
may we, O Vasus, ye possessors of all wealth, come then into the midst of You. {#27:20}

If ye to-day at sunrise, or at noon, or in the gloom of eve,
Lords of all riches, give fair treasure to the man, the wise man who hath sacrificed, {#27:21}

Then we, imperial Rulers, claim of you this boon, your wide protection, as a son.
May we, Ādityas, offering holy gifts, obtain that which shall bring us greater bliss. {#27:22}

* * *

## HYMN XXVIII. Viśvedevas.

THE Thirty Gods and Three besides, whose seat hath been the sacred grass,
From time of old have found and gained. {#28:1}

Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Agnis, with Consorts, sending boons,
To whom our Vaṣaṭ! is addressed: {#28:2}

These are our guardians in the west, and northward here, and in the south,
And on the cast, with all the tribe. {#28:3}

Even as the Gods desire so verily shall it be. None minisheth this power of theirs,
No demon, and no mortal {#28:4}

The Seven carry seven spears; seven are the splendours they possess,
And seven the glories they assume. {#28:5}

* * *

## HYMN XXIX Viśvedevas.

ONE is a youth brown, active, manifold he decks the golden one with ornament. {#29:1}

Another, luminous, occupies the place of sacritice, Sage, among the Gods. {#29:2}

One brandishes in his hand an iron knife, firm, in his seat amid the Deities. {#29:3}

Another holds the thunderbolt, wherewith he slays the Vṛtras, resting in his hand. {#29:4}

Another bears a pointed weapon: bright is he, and strong, with healing medicines. {#29:5}

Another, thief-like, watches well the ways, and knows the places where the treasures lie. {#29:6}

Another with his mighty stride hath made his three steps thither where the Gods rejoice. {#29:7}

Two with one Dame ride on with winged steeds, and journey forth like travellers on their way. {#29:8}

Two, highest, in the heavens have set their seat, worshipped with holy oil, imperial Kings. {#29:9}

Some, singing lauds, conceived the Sāma-hymn, great hymn whereby they caused the Sun to shine. {#29:10}

* * *

## HYMN XXX. Viśvedevas.

NOT one of you, ye Gods, is small, none of you is a feeble child:
All of you, verily, are great. {#30:1}

Thus be ye lauded, ye destroyers of the foe, ye Three-and-Thirty Deities,
The Gods of man, the Holy Ones. {#30:2}

As such defend and succour us, with benedictions speak to us:
Lead us not from our fathers' and from Manu's path into the distance far away. {#30:3}

Ye Deities who stay with us, and all ye Gods of all mankind,
Give us your wide protection, give shelter for cattle and for steed. {#30:4}

* * *

## HYMN XXXI. Various Deities.

THAT Brahman pleases Indra well, who worships, sacrifices, pours Libation, and prepares the meal. {#31:1}

Śakra protects from woe the man who gives him sacrificial cake.
And offers Soma blent with milk. {#31:2}

His chariot shall be glorious, sped by Gods, and mighty shall he be,
Subduing all hostilities. {#31:3}

Each day that passes, in his house flows his libation, rich in milk,
Exhaustless, bringing progeny. {#31:4}

O Gods, with constant draught of milk, husband and wife with one accord
Press out and wash the Soma juice. {#31:5}

They gain sufficient food: they come united to the sacred grass,
And never do they fail in strength. {#31:6}

Never do they deny or seek to hide the favour of the Gods:
They win high glory for themselves. {#31:7}

With sons and daughters by their side they reach their full extent of life,
Both decked with ornaments of gold. {#31:8}

Serving the Immortal One with gifts of sacrificial meal and wealth,
They satisfy the claims of love and pay due honour to the Gods. {#31:9}

We claim protection from the Hills, we claim protection of the Floods,
Of him who stands by Viṣṇu's side. {#31:10}

May Pūṣan come, and Bhaga, Lord of wealth, All-bounteous, for our weal
Broad be the path that leads to bliss: {#31:11}

Aramati, and, free from foes, Visva with spirit of a God,
And the Ādityas’ peerless might. {#31:12}

Seeing that Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa are guarding us,
The paths of Law are fair to tread. {#31:13}

I glorify with song, for wealth, Agni the God, the first of you.
We honour as a well-loved Friend the God who prospereth our fields. {#31:14}

As in all frays the hero, so swift moves his car whom Gods attend.
The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. {#31:15}

Ne’er are ye injured, worshipper, presser of juice, or pious man.
The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. {#31:16}

None in his action equals him, none holds him far or keeps him off.
The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. {#31:17}

Such strength of heroes shall be his, such mastery of fleet-foot steeds.
The man who, sacrificing, strives to win the heart of Deities will conquer those who worship not. {#31:18}

## HYMN XXXII. Indra.

KANVAS, tell forth with song the deeds of Indra, the Impetuous,
Wrought in the Soma's wild delight. {#32:1}

Strong God, he slew Anarsani, Srbinda, Pipru, and the fiend,
Ahīśuva, and loosed the floods. {#32:2}

Thou broughtest down the dwelling-place, the height of lofty Arbuda.
That exploit, Indra, must be famed. {#32:3}

Bold, to your famous Soma I call the fair-visored God for aid,
Down like a torrent from the hill. {#32:4}

Rejoicing in the Soma-draughts, Hero, burst open, like a fort,
The stall of horses and of kine. {#32:5}

If my libation gladdens, if thou takest pleasure in my laud,
Come with thy Godhead from afar. {#32:6}

O Indra, Lover of the Song, the singers of thy praise are we:
O Soma-drinker, quicken us. {#32:7}

And, taking thy delight with us bring us still undiminished food:
Great is thy wealth, O Maghavan. {#32:8}

Make thou us rich in herds of kine, in steeds, in gold: let us exert
Our strength in sacrificial gifts. {#32:9}

Let us call him to aid whose hands stretch far, to whom high laud is due.
Who worketh well to succour us. {#32:10}

He, Śatakratu, even in fight acts as a Vṛtra-slayer s,till:
He gives his worshippers much wealth. {#32:11}

May he, this A;akra, strengthen us, Boon God who satisfies our needs,
Indra, with all lhis saving helps. {#32:12}

To him, the mighty stream of wealth, the Soma-presser's rescuing Friend,
To Indra sing your song of praise; {#32:13}

Who bringeth what is great and firm, who winneth glory in his wars,
Lord of vast wealth through power and might. {#32:14}

There liveth none to cheek or stay his energies and gracious deeds:
None who can say, He giveth not. {#32:15}

No debt is due by Brahmans now, by active men who press the juice:
Well hath each Soma-draught been paid. {#32:16}

Sing ye to him who must be praised, say lauds to him who must be praised,
Bring prayer to him who must be praised. {#32:17}

May be, unchecked, strong, meet for praise, bring hundreds, thousands forth to light,
Indra who aids the worshipper. {#32:18}

Go with thy God-like nature forth, go where the folk are calling thee:
Drink, Indra, of the drops we pour. {#32:19}

Drink milky draughts which are thine own, this too which was with Tugrya once,
This is it, Indra, that is thine. {#32:20}

Pass him who psours libations out in angry mood or after sin:
Here drink the juice we offer thee. {#32:21}

Over the three great distances, past the Five Peoples go thy way,
O Indra, noticing our voice. {#32:22}

Send forth thy ray like Sūrya: let my songs attract thee hitherward,
Like waters gathering to the vale. {#32:23}

Now to the Hero fair of cheek, Adhvaryu, pour the Soma forth:
Bring of the juice that he may drink {#32:24}

Who cleft the water-cloud in twain, loosed rivers for their downward flow,
And set the ripe milk in the kine. {#32:25}

He, meet for praise, slew Vṛtra, slew Ahīśuva, Urnavabha's son,
And pierced th:rough Arbuda with frost. {#32:26}

To him your matchless Mighty One, unconquerable Conqueror,
Sing forth the prayer which Gods have given: {#32:27}

Indra, who in the wild delight of Soma juice considers here
All holy Laws among the Gods. {#32:28}

Hither let these thy Bays who share thy banquet, Steeds with golden manes,
Convey thee to the feast prepared. {#32:29}

Hither, O thou whom many laud, the Bays whom Priyamedha praised,
Shall bring thee to the Soma-draught. {#32:30}

* * *

## HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

WE compass thee like waters, we whose grass is trimmed and Soma pressed.
Here where the filter pours its stream, thy worshippers round thee, O Vṛtra-slayer, sit. {#33:1}

Men, Vasu! by the Soma, with lauds call thee to the foremost place:
When comest thou athirst unto the juice as home, O Indra, like a bellowing bull? {#33:2}

Boldly, Bold Hero, bring us spoil in thousands for the Kaṇvas' sake.
O active Maghavan, with eager prayer we crave the yellow-hued with store ol kine. {#33:3}

Medhyātithi, to Indra sing, drink of the juice to make thee glad.
Close-knit to his Bay Steeds, bolt-armed, beside the juice is he: his chariot is of gold. {#33:4}

He Who is praised as strong of hand both right and left, most wise and hold:
Indra who, rich in hundreds, gathers thousands up, honoured as breaker-down of forts. {#33:5}

The bold of heart whom none provokes, who stands in bearded confidence;
Much-lauded, very glorious, overthrowing foes, strong Helper, like a bull with might. {#33:6}

Who knows what vital ower he wins, drinking beside the flowing juice?
This is the fair-checked God who, joying in the draught, breaks down the castles in his strength. {#33:7}

As a wild elephant rushes on this way and that way, mad with heat,'
None may compel thee, yet come hither to the draught: thou movest mighty in thy power. {#33:8}

When he, the Mighty, ne’er o’erthrown, steadfast, made ready for the fight,
When Indra Maghavan lists to his praiser's call, he will not stand aloof, but come. {#33:9}

Yea, verily, thou art a Bull, with a bull's rush. whom none may stay:
Thou Mighty One, art celebrated as a Bull, famed as a Bull both near and far. {#33:10}

Thy reins are very bulls in strength, bulls' strength is in thy golden whip.
Thy car, O Maghavan, thy Bays are strong as bulls: thou, Śatakratu, art a Bull. {#33:11}

Let the strong presser press for thee. Bring hither, thou straight-rushing Bull.
The mighty makes the mighty run in flowing streams for thee whom thy Bay Horses bear. {#33:12}

Come, thou most potent Indra, come to drink the savoury Soma juice.
Maghavan, very wise, will quickly come to hear the songs, the prayer, the hymns of praise. {#33:13}

When thou hast mounted on thy car let thy yoked Bay Steeds carry thee,
Past other men's libations, Lord of Hundred Powers, thee, Vṛtra-slayer, thee our Friend. {#33:14}

O thou Most Lofty One, accept our laud as nearest to thine heart.
May our libations be most sweet to make thee glad, O Soma-drinker, Heavenly Lord. {#33:15}

Neither in thy decree nor mine, but in another's he delights,—
The man who brought us unto this. {#33:16}

Indra himself hath said, The mind of woman brooks not discipline,
Her intellect hath little weight. {#33:17}

His pair of horses, rushing on in their wild transport, draw his car:
High-lifted is the stallion's yoke. {#33:18}

Cast down thine eyes and look not up. More closely set thy feet. Let none
See what thy garment veils, for thou, a Brahman, hast become a dame. {#33:19}

* * *

## HYMN XXXIV. Indra.

Come hither, Indra, with thy Bays, come thou to Kaṇva's eulogy.
Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven. {#34:1}

May the stone draw thee as it speaks, the Soma-stone with ringing voice.
Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven. {#34:2}

The stones' rim shakes the Soma here like a wolf worrying a sheep.
Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven. {#34:3}

The Kaṇvas call thee hitherward for succour and to win the spoil.
Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven. {#34:4}

I set for thee, as for the Strong, the first draught of the juices shed. {#34:5}

Come with abundant blessings, come with perfect care to succour us. {#34:6}

Come, Lord of lofty thought, who hast infinite wealth and countless aids. {#34:7}

Adorable mid Gods, the Priest good to mankind shall bring thee near. {#34:8}

As wings the falcon, so thy Bays rushing in joy shall carry thee. {#34:9}

Come from the enemy to us, to svaha and the Soma-draught. {#34:10}

Come hither with thine car inclined to hear, take pleasure in our lauds. {#34:11}

Lord of well-nourished Horses, come with well-fed Steeds alike in hue. {#34:12}

Come hither from the mountains, come from regions of the sea of air. {#34:13}

Disclose to us O Hero, wealth in thousands both of kine and steeds. {#34:14}

Bring riches hitherward to us in hundreds, thousands, myriads.
Ye by command of yonder Dyaus, God bright by day! have gone to heaven. {#34:15}

The thousand steeds, the mightiest troop, which we and Indra have received
From Vasurocis as a gift, {#34:16}

The brown that match the wind in speed, and bright bay coursers fleet of foot,
Like Suns, resplendent are they all. {#34:17}

Mid the Pargvata's rich gifts, swift steeds whose wheels run rapidly,
I seemed to stand amid a wood. {#34:18}

## HYMN XXXV. Aśvins.

WITH Agni and with Indra, Viṣṇu. Varuṇa, with the Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus, closely leagued;

Whose worshipper is ne’er o’erthrown. {#43:1}

Wise Agni Jātavedas, I beget a song of praise for thee.
Who willingly receivest it. {#43:2}

Thy sharpened flames, O Agni, like the gleams of light that glitter through,
Devour the forests with their teeth. {#43:3}

Gold-coloured, bannered with the smoke, urged by the wind, aloft to heaven
Rise, lightly borne, the flames of fire. {#43:4}

These lightly kindled fiery flames are all around made visible,
Even as the gleanings of the Dawns. {#43:5}

As Jātavedas speeds along, the dust is black beneath his feet,
When Agni spreads upon the earth. {#43:6}

Making the plants his nourishment, Agni devours and wearies not,
Seeking the tender shrubs again. {#43:7}

Bending him down with all his tongues, he flickers with his fiery glow
Splendid is Agni in the woods. {#43:8}

Agni, thine home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest way,
And as their Child art born anew. {#43:9}

Worshipped with offerings shines thy flame, O Agni, from the sacred oil,
With kisses on the ladle's mouth. {#43:10}

O Agni, to the worshipper. {#43:15}

O Agni, Brother, made by strength, Lord of red steeds and brilliant sway,
Take pleasure in this laud of mine. {#43:16}

My praises, Agni, go to thee, as the cows seek the stall to meet,
The lowing calf that longs for milk. {#43:17}

Agni, best Aṅgiras, to thee all people who have pleasant homes,
Apart, have turned as to their wish. {#43:18}

The sages skilled in holy song and thinkers with their thoughts have urged
Agni to share the sacred feast. {#43:19}

So, Agni, unto thee the Priest, Invoker, strong in forays, pray
Those who spin out the sacrifice. {#43:20}

In many a place, the same in look art thou, a Prince o’er all the tribes
In battles we invoke thine aid. {#43:21}

Pray thou to Agni, pray to him who blazes served with sacred oil:
Let him give ear to this our call. {#43:22}

We call on thee as such, as one who hears, as Jātavedas, one,
Agni! who beats away our foes. {#43:23}

I pray to Agni, King of men, the Wonderful, the President
Of holy Laws: may he give ear. {#43:24}

Him like a bridegroom, him who stirs all people, like a noble horse,
Like a fleet steed, we instigate. {#43:25}

Slaying things deadly, burning up foes, Rākṣasas, on every side,
Shine, Agni, with thy sharpened flame. {#43:26}

Thou whom the people kindle even as Manus did, best Aṅgiras!
O Agni, mark thou this my speech. {#43:27}

O Agni, made by strength! be thou born in the heavens or born in floods,
As such we call on thee with songs. {#43:28}

Yea, all the people, all the folk who have good dwellings, each apart,
Send food for thee to eat thereof. {#43:29}

O Agni, so may we, devout, gazed at by men, throughout our days,
Pass lightly over all distress. {#43:30}

We venerate with cheerful hearts the cheerful Agni, dear to all,
Burning, with purifying flame. {#43:31}

So thou, O Agni rich in light, beaming like Sūrya with thy rays
Boldly demolishest the gloom, {#43:32}

We pray to thee for this thy gift, Victor the gift that faileth not,
O Agni, choicest wealth from thee. {#43:33}

The singer and his ancient hymn. {#44:12}

I invocate the Child of Strength, Agni with purifying flame,
At this well-ordered sacrifice. {#44:13}

With Gods upon our sacred grass. {#44:14}

The mortal man who serves the God Agni within his own abode,
For him he causes wealth to shine. {#44:15}

Agni is head and height of heaven, the Master of the earth is he:

A stately elephant on a hill. {#45:5}

And hear, O Maghavan; to him who craves of thee thou grantest all
Whate’er thou makest firm is firm. {#45:6}

Who for Triśoka clave the hill that formed a wide receptacle,
So that the cows might issue forth. {#45:30}

Whate’er thy plan or purpose be, whate’er, in transport, thou wouldst do,
Do it not, Indra, but be kind. {#45:31}

So come to our libations, Strongest! Excellent! May we obtain a stall of kine. {#46:9}

Responding to our wish for cows, for steeds, and chariots, as of old,
Be gracious, Greatest of the Great {#46:10}

For, Hero, nowhere can I find the bounds of thy munificence.
Still do thou favour us, O Bolt-armed Maghavan: with strength hast thou rewarded hymns. {#46:11}

High, glorifier of his friend, he knows all generations, he whom many praise.
All races of mankind with ladies lifted up invoke that Mighty Indra's aid. {#46:12}

Be he our Champion and Protector in great deeds, rich in all wealth, the Vṛtra-slayer, Maghavan. {#46:13}

In the wild raptures of the juice sing to your Hero with high laud, to him the Wise,
To Indra, glorious in his name, the Mighty One, even as the hymn alloweth it. {#46:14}

Thou givest wealth to me myself, thou givest treasure, Excellent! and the strong steed,
O Much-invoked, in deeds of might, yea, even now. {#46:15}

Him, Sovran Ruler of all precious things, who even hath power o’er this fair form of his,
As now it taketh shape, and afterward, {#46:16}

We praise, so that the Mighty One may speed to you, Pourer of bounties, Traveller, prepared to go.
Thou favourest the Maruts known to all, by song and sacrifice.
With song and praise I sing to thee. {#46:17}

We in the sacrifice perform their will whose voice is lifted high,
The worship of those Thundering Ones who o’er the ridges of these mountains fly in troops. {#46:18}

O Indra, Mightiest, bring us that which crushes men of evil minds,
Wealth suited to our needs, O Stirrer of the thought, best wealth, O thou who stirrest thought. {#46:19}

O Winner, noble winner, strong, wondrous, most splendid, excellent,
Sole Lord of victory, bring all-overpowering wealth, joy-giving, chief in deeds of might. {#46:20}

Now let the godless man approach who hath received reward so great
As Vaśa, Aśvya, when this light of morning dawned, received from Pṛthuśravas, from Kanīta's son. {#46:21}

Steeds sixty thousand and ten thousand kine, and twenty hundred camels I obtained;
Ten hundred brown in hue, and other ten red in three spots: in all, ten thousand kine. {#46:22}

Ten browns that make my wealth increase, fleet steeds whose tails are long and fair,
Turn with swift whirl my chariot wheel; {#46:23}

The gifts which Pṛthuśravas gave, Kanīta's son munificent.
He gave a chariot wrought of gold: the prince was passing bountiful, and won himself most lofty fame. {#46:24}

Come thou to this great rite of ours, Vāyu! to give us vigorous light.
We have served thee that thou mightest give much to us, yea, mightest quickly give great wealth. {#46:25}

Who with thrice seven times seventy horses comes to us, invested with the rays of morn,
Through these our Soma-draughts and those who press, to give, drinker of pure bright Soma Juice. {#46:26}

Who hath inclined this glorious one, bounteous himself, to give me gifts.
Borne on firm chariot with the prosperous Nahuṣa, wise, to a man yet more devout. {#46:27}

Sole Lord in beauty meet for praise, O Vāyu, dropping fatness down,
Hurried along by steeds, by camels, and by hounds, spreads forth thy train: even this it is. {#46:28}

So, as a prize dear to the strong, the sixty thousand have I gained,
Bulls that resemble vigorous steeds. {#46:29}

To me come oxen like a herd, yea, unto me the oxen come. {#46:30}

And in the grazing herd he made a hundred camels bleat for me,
And twenty hundred mid the white. {#46:31}

A hundred has the sage received, Dāsa Balbūtha's and Tarukṣa's gifts.
These are thy people, Vāyu, who rejoice with Indra for their guard, rejoice with Gods for guards. {#46:32}

And now to Vaśa Aśvya here this stately woman is led forth,
Adorned with ornaments of gold. {#46:33}

## HYMN XLVII. Ādityas.

GREAT help ye give the worshipper, Varuṇa, Mitra, Mighty Ones! No sorrow ever reaches him whom ye, Ādityas, keep from harm. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford. {#47:1}

O Gods, Ādityas, well ye know the way to keep all woes afar.
As the birds spread their sheltering wings, spread your protection over us. {#47:2}

As the birds spread their sheltering wings let your protection cover us.
We mean all shelter and defence, ye who have all things for your own. {#47:3}

To whomsoever they, Most Wise, have given a home and means of life,
O'er the whole riches of this man they, the Ādityas, have control. {#47:4}

As drivers of the car avoid ill roads, let sorrows pass us by.
May we be under Indra's guard, in the Ādityas’ favouring grace. {#47:5}

For verily men sink and faint through loss of wealth which ye have given.
Much hath he gained from you, O Gods, whom ye, Ādityas, have approached. {#47:6}

On him shall no fierce anger fall, no sore distress shall visit him,
To whom, Ādityas, ye have lent your shelter that extendeth far. {#47:7}

Resting in you, O Gods, we are like men who fight in coats of mail.
Ye guard us from each great offence, ye guard us from each lighter fault. {#47:8}

May Aditi defend us, may Aditi guard and shelter us,
Mother of wealthy Mitra and of Aryaman and Varuṇa. {#47:9}

The shelter, Gods, that is secure, auspicious, free from malady,
A sure protection, triply strong, even that do ye extend to us. {#47:10}

Look down on us, Ādityas, as a guide exploring from the bank.
Lead us to pleasant ways as men lead horses to an easy ford. {#47:11}

Ill be it for the demons' friend to find us or come near to us.
But for the milch-cow be it well, and for the man who strives for fame. {#47:12}

Each evil deed made manifest, and that which is concealed, O Gods,
The whole thereof remove from us to Trita Āptya far away. {#47:13}

Daughter of Heaven, the dream that bodes evil to us or to our kine,
Remove, O Lady of the Light, to Trita Āptya far away. {#47:14}

Even if, O Child of Heaven, it make a garland or a chain of gold,
The whole bad dream, whate’er it be, to Trita Āptya we consign. {#47:15}

To him whose food and work is this, who comes to take his share therein,
To Trita, and to Dvita, Dawn! bear thou the evil dream away. {#47:16}

As we collect the utmost debt, even the eighth and sixteenth part,
So unto Āptya we transfer together all the evil dream. {#47:17}

Now have we conquered and obtained, and from our trespasses are free.
Shine thou away the evil dream, O Dawn, whereof we are afraid. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford. {#47:18}

## HYMN XLVIII. Soma.

WISELY have I enjoyed the savoury viand, religious-thoughted, best to find out treasure,
The food to which all Deities and mortals, calling it meath, gather themselves together. {#48:1}

Tlou shalt be Aditi as thou hast entered within, appeaser of celestial anger.
Indu, enjoying Indra's friendship, bring us—as a swift steed the car—forward to riches. {#48:2}

We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the light, the Gods discovered.
Now what may foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal man's deception? {#48:3}

Absorbed into the heart, be sweet, O Indu, as a kind father to his son, O Soma,
As a wise Friend to friend: do thou, wide-ruler, O Soma, lengthen out our days for living. {#48:4}

These glorious drops that give me freedom have I drunk. Closely they knit my joints as straps secure a car.
Let them protect my foot from slipping on the way: yea, let the drops I drink preserve me from disease. {#48:5}

Make me shine bright like fire produced by friction: give us a clearer sight and make us better.
For in carouse I think of thee, O Soma, Shall I, as a rich man, attain to comfort? {#48:6}

May we enjoy with an enlivened spirit the juice thou givest, like ancestral riches.
O Soma, King, prolong thou our existence as Sūrya makes the shining days grow longer. {#48:7}

King Soma, favour us and make us prosper: we are thy devotees; of this be mindful.
Spirit and power are fresh in us, O Indu give us not up unto our foeman's pleasure. {#48:8}

For thou hast settled in each joint, O Soma, aim of men's eyes and guardian of our bodies.
When we offend against thine holy statutes, as a kind Friend, God, best of all, be gracious. {#48:9}

May I be with the Friend whose heart is tender, who, Lord of Bays! when quaffed will never harm me-
This Soma now deposited within me. For this, I pray for longer life to Indra. {#48:10}

Our maladies have lost their strength and vanished: they feared, and passed away into the darkness.
Soma hath risen in us, exceeding mighty, and we are come where men prolong existence. {#48:11}

12, Fathers, that Indu which our hearts have drunken, Immortal in himself, hath entered mortals.
So let us serve this Soma with oblation, and rest securely in his grace and favour.

Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself abroad through earth and heaven.
So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become the lords of riches, {#48:13}

Give us your blessing, O ye Gods’ preservers. Never may sleep or idle talk control us.
But evermore may we, as friends of Soma, speak to the synod with brave sons around us. {#48:14}

On all sides,. Soma, thou art our life-giver: aim of all eyes, light-finder, come within us.
Indu, of one accord with thy protections both from behind and from before preserve us. {#48:15}

* * *

## HYMN XLIX. Agni.

AGNI, come hither with thy fires; we choose thee as Invoking Priest.
Let the extended ladle full of oil balm thee, best Priest, to sit on sacred grass. {#49:1}

For unto thee, O Aṅgiras, O Son of Strength, move ladles in the sacrifice.
To Agni, Child of Force, whose locks drop oil, we seek, foremost in sacrificial rites. {#49:2}

Agni, thou art Disposer, Sage, Herald, bright God! and worshipful,
Best offerer, cheerful, to be praised in holy rites, pure Lord! by singers with their hymns. {#49:3}

Most Youthful and Eternal, bring the longing Gods to me, the guileless, for the feast.
Come, Vasu, to the banquet that is well-prepared: rejoice thee, gracious, with our songs. {#49:4}

Famed art thou, Agni, far and wide, Preserver, righteous, and a Sage.
The holy singers, O refulgent kindled God! arrangers, call on thee to come. {#49:5}

Shine, Most Resplendent! blaze, send bliss unto the folk, and to thy worshipper
Great art thou.
So may my princes, with good fires, subduing foes, rest in the keeping of the Gods. {#49:6}

O Agni, as thou burnest down to earth even high-grown underwood,
So, bright as Mitra is, burn him who injures us, him who plots ill against thy friend. {#49:7}

Give us not as a prey to mortal enemy, nor to the wicked friend of fiends.
With conquering guards, auspicious, unassailable, protect us, O Most Youthful God. {#49:8}

Protect us, Agni, through the first, protect us through the second hymn,
Protect us through three hymns, O Lord of Power and Might, through four hymns, Vasu, guard thou us. {#49:9}

Preserve us from each fiend who brings the Gods no gift, preserve thou us in deeds of strength:
For we possess in thee the nearest Friend of all, for service of the Gods and weal. {#49:10}

O Holy Agni, give us wealth renowned with men and strengthening life.
Bestow on us, O Helper, that which many crave, more glorious still by righteousness; {#49:11}

Wherewith we may o’ercome our rivals in the war, o’erpowering the foe's designs.
So wax thou by our food, O Excellent in strength. Quicken our thoughts that find out wealth. {#49:12}

Agni is even as a bull who whets and brandishes his horns.
Well-sharpened are his jaws which may not be withstood: the Child of Strength hath powerful teeth. {#49:13}

Not to be stayed, O Bull, O Agni, are thy teeth when thou art spreading far and wide.
Make our oblations duly offered up, O Priest, and give us store of precious things. {#49:14}

Thou liest in the wood: from both thy Mothers mortals kindle thee.
Unweariedly thou bearest up the offerer's gifts, then shinest bright among the Gods. {#49:15}

And so the seven priests, O Agni, worship thee, Free-giver, Everlasting One.
Thou cleavest through the rock with heat and fervent glow. Agni, rise up above the men. {#49:16}

For you let us whose grass is trimmed call Agni, Agni, restless God.
Let us whose food is offered call to all the tribes Agni the Invoking Priest of men. {#49:17}

Agni, with noble psalm that tells his wish he dwells, thinking on thee who guardest him.
Speedily bring us strength of many varied sorts to be most near to succour us. {#49:18}

Agni, Praise-singer! Lord of men, God burner-up of Rākṣasas,
Mighty art thou, the ever-present Household-Lord, Home-friend and Guardian from the sky. {#49:19}

Let no fiend come among us, O thou rich in light, no spell of those who deal in spells.
To distant pastures drive faint hunger: far away, O Agni, chase the demons’ friends. {#49:20}

* * *

## HYMN L. Indra.

BOTH boons,—may Indra, hitherward turned, listen to this prayer of ours,
And mightiest Maghavan with thought inclined to us come near to drink the Soma juice. {#50:1}

For him, strong, independent Ruler, Heaven and Earth have fashioned forth for power and might.
Thou seatest thee as first among thy peers in place, for thy soul longs for Soma juice. {#50:2}

Fill thyself full, O Lord of wealth, O Indra, with the juice we shed.
We know thee, Lord of Bay Steeds victor in the fight, vanquishing e’en the invincible. {#50:3}

Changeless in truth, O Maghavan Indra, let it be as thou in wisdom willest it.
May we, O fair of check, win booty with thine aid, O Thunderer, swiftly seeking it. {#50:4}

Indra, with all thy saving helps give us assistance, Lord of power.
For after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee, Hero, finder-out of wealth. {#50:5}

Increaser of our steeds and multiplying kine, a golden well, O God, art thou,
For no one may impair the gifts laid up in thee. Bring me whatever thing I ask. {#50:6}

For thou,—come to the worshipper!—wilt find great wealth to make us rich.
Fill thyself full, O Maghavan, for gain of kine, full, Indra, for the gain of steeds. {#50:7}

Thou as thy gift bestowest many hundred herds, yea, many thousands dost thou give.
With singers' hymns have we brought the Fort-render near, singing to Indra for his grace. {#50:8}

Whether the simple or the sage, Indra, have offered praise to thee,
He Śatakratu! by his love hath gladdened thee, ambitious! ever pressing on! {#50:9}

If he the Strong of arm, the breaker-down of forts, the great Destroyer, hear my call,
We, seeking riches cry to Indra, Lord of wealth, to Śatakratu with our lauds. {#50:10}

We count not then as sinners, nor as niggardly or foolish men,
When with the Soma juice which we have shed we make Indra, the Mighty One, our Friend. {#50:11}

Him have we yoked in fight, the powerful Conqueror, debt-claimer, not to be deceived.
Best charioteer, the Victor marks each fault, he knows the strong to whom he will come near. {#50:12}

Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid.
Help us, O Maghavan, let thy succour give us this: drive away foes and enemies. {#50:13}

For thou, O liberal Lord of bounty, strengthenest his ample home who worships thee.
So Indra, Maghavan, thou Lover of the Song, we with pressed Soma call on thee, {#50:14}

Indra is Vṛtra-slayer, guard, our best defender from the foe.
May he preserve our last and middlemost, and keep watch from behind us and before. {#50:15}

Defend us from behind, below, above, in front, on all sides, Indra, shield us well.
Keep far away from us the terror sent from heaven: keep impious weapons far away. {#50:16}

Protect us, Indra, each to-day, each morrow, and each following day.
Our singers, through all days, shalt thou, Lord of the brave, keep safely both by day and night. {#50:17}

A crushing Warrior, passing rich is Maghavan, endowed with all heroic might.
Thine arms, O Śatakratu, are exceeding strong, arms which have grasped the thunderbolt. {#50:18}

* * *

## HYMN LI. Indra.

OFFER ye up as praise to him that wherein Indra takes delight.
The Soma-bringers magnify Indra's great energy with hymns. Good are the gifts that Indra gives. {#51:1}

Sole among chiefs, companionless, impetuous, and peerless, he
Hath waxen great o’er many folk, yea., over all things born, in might. {#51:2}

Lord of swift bounty, he will win e’en with a steed of worthless sort.
This, Indra, must be told of thee who wilt perform heroic deeds. {#51:3}

Come to us hither: let us pay devotions that enhance thy might,
For which, Most Potent! thou wouldst fain bless the man here who strives for fame. {#51:4}

For thou, O Indra, makest yet more bold the spirit of the bold
Who with strong Soma serveth thee, still ready with his reverent prayers. {#51:5}

Worthy of song, he looketh down as a man looketh into wells.
Pleased with the Soma-bringer's skill he maketh him his mate and friend. {#51:6}

In strength and wisdom all the Gods, Indra, have yielded unto thee.
Be thou the Guard of all, O thou whom many praise. {#51:7}

Praised, Indra, is this might of thine, best for the service of the Gods,
That thou with power dost slay Vṛtra, O Lord of Strength. {#51:8}

He makes the races of mankind like synods of the Beauteous One.
Indra knows this his manifest deed, and is renowned. {#51:9}

Thy might, O Indra, at its birth, thee also, and thy mental power,
In thy care, Maghavan rich in kine! they have increased exceedingly. {#51:10}

O Vṛtra-slayer, thou and I will both combine for winning spoil.
Even malignity will consent, O Bolt-armed Hero, unto us. {#51:11}

Let us extol this Indra as truthful and never as untrue.
Dire is his death who pours no gifts great light hath he who offers them. Good are the gifts that Indra gives. {#51:12}

* * *

## HYMN LII. Indra.

WITH powers of Mighty Ones hath he, Ancient, Beloved, been equipped,
Through whom the Father Manu made prayers efficacious with the Gods. {#52:1}

Him, Maker of the sky, let stones wet with the Soma ne’er forsake,
Nor hymns and prayer that must be said. {#52:2}

Indra who knew full well disclosed the kine to the Aṅgirases.
This his great deed must be extolled. {#52:3}

Indra, promoter of the song, the sage's Strengthener as of old,
Shall come to bless and succour us at presentation of this laud. {#52:4}

Now after their desire's intent the pious singers with the cry
Of Hail! have sung loud hymns to thee, Indra, to gain a stall of kine. {#52:5}

With Indra rest all deeds of might, deeds done and yet to be performed,
Whom singers know devoid of guile. {#52:6}

When the Five Tribes with all their men to Indra have sent out their voice,
And when the priest hath strewn much grass, this is the Friend's own dwelling-place. {#52:7}

This praise is verily thine own: thou hast performed these manly deeds,
And sped the wheel upon its way. {#52:8}

At the o’erflowing of this Steer, boldly he strode for life, and took
Soma as cattle take their corn. {#52:9}

Receiving this and craving help, we, who with you are Dakṣa's sons,
Would fain exalt the Maruts’ Lord. {#52:10}

Yea, Hero, with the singers we sing to the duly-coming Band.
Allied with thee may we prevail. {#52:11}

With us are raining Rudras, clouds accordant in call to battle, at the death of Vṛtra, {#52:12}

The strong assigned to him who sings and praises. May Gods with Indra at their head protect us.

## HYMN LIII. Indra.

MAY our hymns give thee great delight. Display thy bounty, Thunderer.
Drive off the enemies of prayer. {#53:1}

Crush with thy foot the niggard churls who bring no gifts. Mighty art thou
There is not one to equal thee. {#53:2}

Thou art the Lord of Soma pressed, Soma impressed is also thine.
Thou art the Sovran of the folk. {#53:3}

Come, go thou forth, dwelling in heaven and listening to the prayers of men:
Thou fillest both the heavens and earth. {#53:4}

Even that hill with rocky heights, with hundreds, thousands, held within.
Thou for thy worshippers brakest through. {#53:5}

We call on thee both night and day to taste the flowing Soma juice:
Do thou fulfil our heart's desire. {#53:6}

Where is that ever-youthful Steer, strong. necked and never yet bent down?
What Brahman ministers to him? {#53:7}

To whose libation doth the Steer, betake him with delight therein?
Who takes delight in Indra now? {#53:8}

Whom, Vṛtra-slayer, have thy gift and hero powers accompanied?
Who is thy dearest in the laud? {#53:9}

For thee among mankind, among the Pūrus is this Soma shed.
Hasten thou hither: drink thereof. {#53:10}

This, growing by Soma and by Śaryaṇāvān, dear to thee,
In Ārjīkīya, cheers thee best. {#53:11}

Hasten thou hitherward, and drink this for munificence to-day,
Delightful for thine eager draught. {#53:12}

## HYMN LIV. Indra.

THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men from east and west, from north and south,
Come hither quickly with fleet steeds {#54:1}

If in the effluence of heaven, rich in its light, thou takest joy,
Or in the sea in Soma juice. {#54:2}

With songs I call thee, Great and Wide, even as a cow to profit us,
Indra, to drink the Soma-draught. {#54:3}

Hither, O Indra, let thy Bays bear up and, bring upon thy car
Thy glory, God! and majesty. {#54:4}

Thou, Indra, wouldst be sung and praised as great, strong, lordly in thy deeds
Come hither, drink our Soma juice. {#54:5}

We who have shed the Soma and prepared the feast are calling thee.
To sit on this our sacred grass. {#54:6}

As, Indra, thou art evermore the common Lord of all alike,
As such we invocate thee now. {#54:7}

The men with stones have milked for thee this nectar of the Soma juice:
Indra, be pleased with it, and drink. {#54:8}

Neglect all pious men with skill in sacred song: come hitherward,
With speed, and give us high renown. {#54:9}

Gods, may the mighty rest unharmed, the King who gives me spotted kine,
Kine decked with golden ornaments. {#54:10}

Beside a thousand spotted kine I have received a gift of gold,
Pure, brilliant, and exceeding great. {#54:11}

Durgaha's grandsons, giving me a thousand kine, munificent,
Have won renown among the Gods. {#54:12}

LOUD singing at the sacred rite where Soma flows we priests invoke
With haste, that he may help, as the bard's Cherisher, Indra who findeth wealth for you. {#55:1}

Whom with fair helm, in rapture of the juice, the firm resistless slayers hinder not:
Giver of glorious wealth to him who sing a his praise, honouring him who toils and pours: {#55:2}

Śakra, who like a curry-comb for horses or a golden goad,
Indra, the Vṛtra-slayer, urges eagerly the opening of the stall of kine: {#55:3}

Who for the worshipper scatters forth ample wealth, even though buried, piled in heaps:
May Indra, Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed Thunderer, act at his pleasure, as he lists. {#55:4}

Hero whom many praise, what thou hast longed for, oven of old, from men.
All that we offer unto thee, O Indra, now, sacrifice, laud, effectual speech. {#55:5}

To Soma, Much-invoked, Bolt-armed! for thy carouse, Celestial, Soma-drinker come.
Thou to the man who- prays and pours the juice hast been best giver of delightful wealth. {#55:6}

Here, verily, yesterday we let the Thunder-wielder drink his fill.
So in like manner offer him the juice today. Now range you by the Glorious One. {#55:7}

Even the wolf, the savage beast that rends the sheep, follows the path of his decrees.
So graciously accepting, Indra, this our praise, with wondrous thought come forth to us. {#55:8}

What manly deed of vigour now remains that Indra hath not done?
Who hath not heard his glorious title and his fame, the Vṛtra-slayer from his birth? {#55:9}

'How great his power resistless! how invincible the Vṛtra-slayer's matchless might!
Indra excels all usurers who see the day, excels all traffickers in strength. {#55:10}

O Indra, Vṛtra-slayer, we, thy very constant worshippers,
Bring prayers ne’er heard before to thee, O Much-invoked, O Thunder-armed, to be thy meed. {#55:11}

O thou of mighty acts, the aids that are in thee call forward many an eager hope.
Past the drink-offerings, Vasu, even of the good, hear my call, Strongest God, and come. {#55:12}

Verily, Indra, we are thine, we worshippers depend on thee.
For there is none but only thou to show us race, O Maghavan, thou much invoked. {#55:13}

From this our misery and famine set us free, from this dire curse deliver us.
Succour us with thine help and with thy wondrous thought. Most Mighty, finder of the way. {#55:14}

Now pray we to these Ksatriyas, to the Ādityas for their aid,
These who are gracious to assist. {#56:1}

May Mitra bear us o’er distress, and Varuṇa and Aryaman,
Yea, the Ādityas, as they know. {#56:2}

For wonderful and meet for praise is these Ādityas’ saving help
To him who offers and prepares. {#56:3}

The mighty aid of you, the Great, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,
We claim to be our sure defence. {#56:4}

Are yc not they who hear our call? {#56:5}

Graciously bless ye us therewith. {#56:6}

Ādityas, Gods, from sorrow there is freedom; for the sinless, wealth,
O ye in whom no fault is seen. {#56:7}

For strong is Indra and renowned. {#56:8}

O Gods who fain would lend your aid, destroy not us as ye destroy
Your enemies who go astray. {#56:9}

And thee too, O Great Aditi, thee also, Goddess, I address,
Thee very gracious to assist. {#56:10}

Save us in depth and shallow from the foe, thou Mother of Strong Sons
Let no one of our seed be harmed. {#56:11}

Far-spread! wide-ruling! grant that we, unharmed by envy, may expand
Grant that our progeny may live. {#56:12}

Those who, the Princes of the folk, in native glory, ne’er deceived,
Maintain their statutes, void of guile— {#56:13}

As such, from mouth of ravening wolves, O ye Ādityas, rescue us,
Like a bound thief, O Aditi. {#56:14}

Ādityas, let this arrow, yea, let this malignity depart
From us or e’er it strike us dead. {#56:15}

For, Bountiful Ādityas, we have evermore enjoyed your help,
Both now and in die days of old. {#56:16}

To every one, O ye Most Wise, who turneth even from sin to you,
Ye Gods vouchsafe that he may live. {#56:17}

May this new mercy profit us, which, ye Ādityas, frees like one,
Bound from his bonds, O Aditi. {#56:18}

O ye Ādityas, this your might is not to be despised by us:
So be ye graciously inclined. {#56:19}

Let not Vivasvān's weapon nor the shaft, Ādityas, wrought with skill,
Destroy us ere old age be nigh. {#56:20}

On every side dispel all sin, Ādityas, all hostility,
Indigence, and combined attack. {#56:21}

Strong in thy deeds, checking assault, Lord, Mightiest Indra, of the brave! {#57:1}

Great in thy power and wisdom, Strong, with thought that comprehendeth all
Thou hast filled full with majesty. {#57:2}

Thou very Mighty One, whose hands by virtue of thy greatness grasp,
The golden bolt that breaks its way. {#57:3}

Your Lord of might that ne’er hath bent, that ruleth over all mankind,
I call, that he, as he is wont, may aid the chariots and the men. {#57:4}

Whom, ever furthering, in frays that win the light, in both the hosts
Men call to succour and to help. {#57:5}

Indra, the Strong, the measureless, worthy of praise, Most Bountiful,
Sole Ruler even over wealth. {#57:6}

Him, for his ample bounty, him, this Indra do I urge to drink,
Who, as his praise was sung of old, the Dancer, is the Lord of men. {#57:7}

Thou Mighty One, whose friendship none of mortals ever hath obtained
None will attain unto thy might. {#57:8}

Aided by thee, with thee allied, in frays for water and for sun,
Bolt-armed! may we win ample spoil. {#57:9}

So seek we thee with sacrifice and songs, chief Lover of the Song,
As, in our battles Indra, thou to Purumayya gavest help. {#57:10}

O Thunderer, thou whose friendship and whose onward guidance both are sweet,
Thy sacrifice must be prepared. {#57:11}

To us, ourselves, give ample room, give for our dwelling ample room
Give ample room to us to live. {#57:12}

We count the banquet of the Gods a spacious pathway for the men,
And for the cattle, and the car. {#57:13}

Six men, yea, two and two, made glad with Soma juice, come near to me
With offerings pleasant to the taste. {#57:14}

Two brown-hued steeds, Indrota's gift, two bays from Rksa's son were mine,
From Asvamedha's son two red. {#57:15}

From Atithigva good car-steeds; from Arksa rein-obeying steeds,
From Asvamedha beauteous ones. {#57:16}

Indrota, Atithigva's son, gave me six horses matched with mares
And Patakratu gave besides. {#57:17}

Marked above all, amid the brown, is the red mare Vṛṣanvati,
Obedient to the rein and whip. {#57:18}

O bound to me by deeds of might, not even the man who loves to blame.
Hath found a single fault in you. {#57:19}

* * *

## HYMN LVIII. Indra.

I SEND you forth the song of praise for Indu, hero-gladdener.
With hymn and plenty he invites you to complete the sacrifice. {#58:1}

Thou wishest for thy kine a bull, for those who long for his approach,
For those who turn away from him, lord of thy cows whom none may kill. {#58:2}

The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught of Soma juice:
Clans in the birth-place of the Gods, in the three luminous realms of heaven. {#58:3}

Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the kine,
The Son of Truth, Lord of the brave. {#58:4}

Hither his Bay Steeds have been sent, red Steeds are on the sacred grass,,
Where we in concert sing our songs. {#58:5}

For Indra Thunder-armed the kine have yielded mingled milk and meath,
What time he found them in the vault. {#58:6}

When I and Indra mount on high up to the Bright One's place and home,
We, having drunk of meath, will reach his seat whose Friends are three times seven. {#58:7}

Sing, sing ye forth your songs of praise, ye Briyamedhas, sing your songs:
Yea, let young children sing their lauds as a strong castle praise ye him. {#58:8}

Now loudly let the viol sound, the lute send out its voice with might,
Shrill be, the music of the string. To Indra. is the hymn up-raised. {#58:9}

When hither speed the dappled cows, unflinching, easy to be milked,
Seize quickly, as it bursts away, the Soma juice for Indra's drink. {#58:10}

Indra hath drunk, Agni hath drunk. all Deities have drunk their fill.
Here Varuṇa shall have his home, to whom the floods have sung aloud as mother-kine unto their calves. {#58:11}

Thou, Varuṇa, to whom belong Seven Rivers, art a glorious God.
The waters flow into thy throat as ’twere a pipe with ample mouth. {#58:12}

He who hath made the fleet steeds spring, well-harnessed, to the worshipper,
He, the swift Guide, is that fair form that loosed the horses near at hand. {#58:13}

Indra, the very Mighty, holds his enemies in utter scorn.
He, far away, and yet a child, cleft the cloud smitten by his voice. {#58:14}

He, yet a boy exceeding small, mounted his newly-fashioned car.
He for his Mother and his Sire cooked the wild mighty buffalo. {#58:15}

Lord of the home, fair-helmeted, ascend thy chariot wrought of gold.
We will attend the Heavenly One, the thousand-footed, red of hue, matchless, who blesses where he goes. {#58:16}

With reverence they come hitherward to him as to. a Sovran lord,
That they may bring him near for this man's good success, to prosper and bestow his gifts. {#58:17}

The Priyamedhas have observed the offering of the men of old,
Of ancient custom, while they strewed the sacred grass, and spread their sacrificial food. {#58:18}

* * *

## HYMN LIX. Indra.

HE who, as Sovran Lord of men, moves with his chariots unrestrained,
The Vṛtra-slayer vanquisher, of fighting hosts, preeminent, is praised with song. {#59:1}

Honour that Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustaining hand of old,
The splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun was set in heaven. {#59:2}

No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens evermore:
No, not by sacrifice, to Indra. praised o all, resistless, daring, bold in might. {#59:3}

The potent Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth the Mighty Ones,
The Kine who spread afar, sent their loud voices out, heavens, earths seat their loud voices out, {#59:4}

O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were thine—
No, not a thousand Suns could match thee at thy birth, not both the worlds, O Thunderer. {#59:5}

Thou, Hero, hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all with strength, O Strongest One.
Maghavan, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with wondrous aids. {#59:6}

Let not a godless mortal gain this food, O thou whose life is long!
But one who yokes the bright-hued steeds, the Etasas, even Indra yoker of the Bays. {#59:7}

Urge ye the Conqueror to give, your Indra greatly to be praised,
To be invoked in shallow waters and in depths, to be invoked in deeds of might. {#59:8}

O Vasu, O thou Hero, raise us up to ample opulence.
Raise us to gain of mighty wealth, O Maghavan, O Indra, to sublime renown. {#59:9}

Indra, thou justifiest us, and tramplest down thy slanderers.
Guard thyself, valiant Hero, in thy vital parts: strike down the Dāsa with thy blows. {#59:10}

The man who brings no sacrifice, inhuman, godless, infidel,
Him let his friend the mountain cast to rapid death, the mountain cast the Dasyu down. {#59:11}

O Mightiest Indra, loving us, gather thou up, as grains of corn,
Within thine hand, of these their kine, to give away, yea, gather twice as loving us. {#59:12}

O my companions, wish for power. How may we perfect Sara's praise,
The liberal princely patron, never to be harmed? {#59:13}

By many a sage whose grass is trimmed thou art continually praised,
That thou, O Sara, hast bestowed here one and here another calf. {#59:14}

The noble, Suradeva's son, hath brought a calf, led by the car to three of us.
As a chief brings a goat to milk. {#59:15}

* * *

## HYMN LX. Agni.

O AGNI, with thy mighty wealth guard us from all malignity,
Yea, from all hate of mortal man. {#60:1}

For over thee, O Friend from birth, the wrath of man hath no control:
Nay, Guardian of the earth art thou. {#60:2}

As such, with all the Gods, O Son of Strength, auspicious in thy flame.
Give us wealth bringing all things good. {#60:3}

Malignities stay not from wealth the mortal man whom, Agni, thou
Protectest while he offers gifts. {#60:4}

Sage Agni, be whom thou dost urge, in worship of the Gods, to wealth,
With thine assistance winneth kine. {#60:5}

Riches with many heroes thou hast for the man who offers gifts:
Lead thou us on to higher bliss. {#60:6}

Save us, O Jātavedas, nor abandon us to him who sins,
Unto the evil-hearted man. {#60:7}

O Agni, let no godless man avert thy bounty as a God:
Over all treasures thou art Lord. {#60:8}

So, Son of Strength, thou aidest us to what is great and excellent.
Those, Vasu! Friend! who sing thy praise. {#60:9}

Let our songs come anear to him beauteous and bright with piercing flame
Our offerings, with our homage, to the
Lord of wealth, to him whom many praise, for help: {#60:10}

To Agni Jātavedas, to the Son of Strength, that he may give us precious gifts,
Immortal, from of old Priest among mortal men, the most delightful in the house. {#60:11}

Agni, made yours by sacrifice, Agni, while holy rites advance;
Agni, the first in songs, first with the warrior steed; Agni to win the land for us. {#60:12}

May Agni who is Lord of wealth vouchsafe us food for friendship sake.
Agni we ever seek for seed and progeny, the Vasu who protects our lives. {#60:13}

Solicit with your chants, for help, Agni the God with piercing flame,
For riches famous Agni, Purumīlha and ye men! Agni to light our dwelling well. {#60:14}

Agni we laud that he may keep our foes afar, Agni to give us health and strength.
Let him as Guardian be invoked in all the tribes, the lighter-up of glowing brands. {#60:15}

* * *

## HYMN LXI. Agni.

PREPARE oblation: let him come; and let the minister serve again
Who knows the ordering thereof, {#61:1}

Rejoicing in his friendship, let the priest be seated over man,
Beside the shoot of active power. {#61:2}

Him, glowing bright beyond all thought, they seek among the race of man;
With him for tongue they seize the food. {#61:3}

He hath inflamed the twofold plain: life-giving, he hath climbed the wood,
And with his tongue hath struck the rock. {#61:4}

Wandering here the radiant Calf finds none to fetter him, and seeks
The Mother to declare his praise. {#61:5}

And now that great and mighty team, the team of horses that are his,
And traces of his car, are seen. {#61:6}

The seven milk a single cow; the two set other five to work,
On the stream's loud-resounding bank. {#61:7}

Entreated by Vivasvān's ten, Indra cast down the water-jar
With threefold hammer from the sky. {#61:8}

Three times the newly-kindled flame proceeds around the sacrifice:
The priests anoint it with the meath. {#61:9}

With reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel above,
Exhaustless, with the mouth below. {#61:10}

The pressing-stones are set at work: the meath is poured into the tank,
At the out-shedding of the fount. {#61:11}

Ye cows, protect the fount: the two Mighty Ones bless the sacrifice.
The handles twain are wrought of gold. {#61:12}

Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the heaven and earth
Supply the liquid to the Bull. {#61:13}

These know their own abiding-place: like calves beside the mother cows
They meet together with their kin. {#61:14}

Devouring in their greedy jaws, they make sustaining food in heaven,
To Indra, Agni light and prayer. {#61:15}

The Pious One milked out rich food, sustenance dealt in portions seven,
Together with the Sun's seven rays. {#61:16}

I took some Soma when the Sun rose up, O Mitra, Varuṇa.
That is the sick man's medicine. {#61:17}

From where oblations must be laid, which is the Well-beloved's home,
He with his tongue hath compassed heaven. {#61:18}

* * *

## HYMN LXII. Aśvins.

ROUSE ye for him who keeps the Law, yoke your steeds, Aśvins, to your car
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:1}

Come, Aśvins, with your car more swift than is the twinkling of an eye
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:2}

Aśvins, ye overlaid with cold the fiery pit for Atri's sake:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:3}

Where are ye? whither are ye gone? whither, like falcons, have ye flown?
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:4}

If ye at any time this day are listening to this my call,
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:5}

The Aśvins, first to hear our prayer, for closest kinship I approach:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:6}

For Atri ye, O Aśvins, made a dwelling-place to shield him well,
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:7}

Ye warded off the fervent heat for Atri when he sweetly spake:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:8}

Erst Saptavadhri by his prayer obtained the trenchant edge of fire:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:9}

Come hither, O ye Lords of wealth, and listen to this call of mine:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:10}

What is this praise told forth of you as Elders in the ancient way?
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:11}

One common brotherhood is yours, Aśvins your kindred is the same:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:12}

This is your chariot, Aśvins, which speeds through the regions, earth and heaven
Let your protecting aid be near. {#62:13}

Approach ye hitherward to us with thousands both of steeds and kine:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:14}

Pass us not by, remember us with thousands both of kine and steeds:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:15}

The purple-tinted Dawn hath risen, and true to Law hath made the light
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:16}

He looked upon the Aśvins, as an axe-armed man upon a tree:
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:17}

By the black band encompassed round, break it down, bold one, like a fort.
Let your protecting help be near. {#62:18}

* * *

## HYMN LXIII. Agni.

EXERTING all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in speech
Agni your dear familiar Friend, the darling Guest in every home. {#63:1}

Whom, served with sacrificial oil like Mitra, men presenting gifts
Eulogize with their songs of praise {#63:2}

Much-lauded Jātavedas, him who bears oblations up to heaven
Prepared in service of the Gods. {#63:3}

To noblest Agni, Friend of man, best Vṛtra-slayer, are we come,
Him in whose presence Rksa's son, mighty Srutarvan, waxes great; {#63:4}

To deathless Jātavedas, meet for praise, adored, with sacred oil,
Visible through the gloom of night {#63:5}

Even Agni whom these priestly men worship with sacrificial gifts,
With lifted ladles offering them. {#63:6}

O Agni, this our newest hymn hath been addressed from us to thee,
O cheerful Guest, well-born, most wise, worker of wonders, ne’er deceived. {#63:7}

Agni, may it be dear to thee, most grateful, and exceeding sweet:
Grow mightier, eulogized therewith. {#63:8}

Splendid with splendours may it be, and in the battle with the foe
Add loftier glory to thy fame. {#63:9}

Steed, cow, a lord of heroes, bright like Indra, who shall fill the car.
Whose high renown ye celebrate, and people praise each glorious deed. {#63:10}

Thou whom Gopavana made glad with song, O Agni Aṅgiras,
Hear this my call, thou Holy One. {#63:11}

Thou whom the priestly folk implore to aid the gathering of the spoil,
Such be thou in the fight with foes. {#63:12}

I, called to him who reels with joy, Srutarvan, Rksa's son, shall stroke
The heads of four presented steeds, like the long wool of fleecy rams. {#63:13}

Four coursers with a splendid car, Savistha's horses, fleet of foot,
Shall bring me to the sacred feast, as flying steeds brought Tugra's son. {#63:14}

The very truth do I declare to thee, Paruṣṇī, mighty flood.
Waters! no man is there who gives more horses than Savistha gives. {#63:15}

* * *

## HYMN LXIV. Agni.

YOKE, Agni, as a charioteer, thy steeds who best invite the Gods: As ancient Herald seat thyself. {#64:1}

And, God, as skilfullest of all, call for us hitherward the Gods:
Give all our wishes sure effect. {#64:2}

For thou, Most Youthful, Son of Strength, thou to whom sacrifice is paid,
Art holy, faithful to the Law. {#64:3}

This Agni, Lord of wealth and spoil hundredfold, thousandfold, is head
And chief of riches and a Sage. {#64:4}

As craftsmen bend the felly, so bend at our general call: come nigh,
Aṅgiras, to the sacrifice. {#64:5}

Now, O Virūpa, rouse for him, Strong God who shines at early morn,
Fair praise with voice that ceases not. {#64:6}

With missile of this Agni, his who looks afar, will we lay low
The thief in combat for the kine. {#64:7}

Let not the Companies of Gods fail us, like Dawns that float away,
Like cows who leave the niggardly. {#64:8}

Let not the sinful tyranny of any fiercely hating foe
Smite us, as billows smite a ship. {#64:9}

O Agni, God, the people sing reverent praise to thee for strength:
With terrors trouble thou the foe. {#64:10}

Wilt thou not, Agni, lend us aid in winning cattle, winning wealth?
Maker of room, make room for us. {#64:11}

In this great battle cast us not aside as one who bears a load:
Snatch up the wealth and win it all. {#64:12}

O Agni, let this plague pursue and fright another and not us:
Make our impetuous strength more strong. {#64:13}

The reverent or unwearied man whose holy labour he accepts,
Him Agni favours with success. {#64:14}

Abandoning the foeman's host pass hither to this company:
Assist the men with whom I stand. {#64:15}

As we have known thy gracious help, as of a Father, long ago,
So now we pray to thee for bliss. {#64:16}

* * *

## HYMN LXV. Indra.

NOT to forsake me, I invoke this Indra girt by Maruts,
Lord Of magic power who rules with might. {#65:1}

This Indra with his Marut Friends clave into pieces Vṛtra's bead
With hundred-knotted thunderbolt. {#65:2}

Indra, with Marut Friends grown strong, hath rent asunder Vṛtra, and
Released the waters of the sea. {#65:3}

This is that Indra who, begirt by Maruts, won the light of heaven
That he might drink the Soma juice. {#65:4}

Mighty, impetuous, begirt by Maruts, him who loudly roars,
Indra we invocate with songs. {#65:5}

Indra begirt by Maruts we invoke after the ancient plan,
That he may drink the Soma juice. {#65:6}

O liberal Indra, Marut-girt, much-lauded Śatakratu, drink
The Soma at this sacrifice. {#65:7}

To thee, O Indra, Marut-girt, these Soma juices, Thunderer!
Are offered from the heart with lauds. {#65:8}

Drink, Indra, with thy Marut Friends, pressed Soma at the morning rites,
Whetting thy thunderbolt with strength. {#65:9}

Arising in thy might, thy jaws thou shookest, Indra, having quaffed
The Soma which the mortar pressed. {#65:10}

Indra, both worlds complained to thee when uttering thy fearful roar,
What time thou smotest Dasyus dead. {#65:11}

From Indra have I measured out a song eight-footed with nine parts,
Delicate, faithful. to the Law. {#65:12}

* * *

## HYMN LXVI. Indra.

SCARCELY was Śatakratu, born when of his Mother he inquired,
Who are the mighty? Who are famed? {#66:1}

Then Śavasī declared to him Aurṇavābha, Ahīśuva:
Son, these be they thou must o’erthrow {#66:2}

The Vṛtra-slayer smote them all as spokes are hammered into naves:
The Dasyu-killer waxed in might. {#66:3}

Then Indra at a single draught drank the contents of thirty pails,
Pails that were filled with Soma juice. {#66:4}

Indra in groundless realms of space pierced the Gandharva through, that he
Might make Brahmans' strength increase. {#66:5}

Down from the mountains Indra shot hither his well-directed shaft:
He gained the ready brew of rice. {#66:6}

One only is that shaft of thine, with thousand feathers, hundred barbs,
Which, Indra, thou hast made thy friend. {#66:7}

Strong as the Ṛbhus at thy birth, therewith to those who praise thee, men,
And women, bring thou food to eat. {#66:8}

By thee these exploits were achieved, the mightiest deeds, abundantly:
Firm in thy heart thou settest them. {#66:9}

All these things Viṣṇu brought, the Lord of ample stride whom thou hadst sent-
A hundred buffaloes, a brew of rice and milk: and Indra, slew the ravening boar {#66:10}

Most deadly is thy bow, successful, fashioned well: good is thine arrow, decked with gold.
Warlike and well equipped thine arms are, which increase sweetness for him who drinks the sweet. {#66:11}

* * *

## HYMN LXVII. Indra.

BRING us a thousand, Indra, as our guerdon for the Soma juice:
Hundreds of kine, O Hero, bring. {#67:1}

Bring cattle, bring us ornament, bring us embellishment and steeds,
Give us, besides, two rings of gold. {#67:2}

And, Bold One, bring in ample store rich jewels to adorn the ear,
For thou, Good Lord, art far renowned. {#67:3}

None other is there for the priest, Hero! but thou, to give him gifts,
To win much spoil and prosper him. {#67:4}

Indra can never be brought low, Śakra can never be subdued:
He heareth and beholdeth all. {#67:5}

He spieth out the wrath of man, he who can never be deceived:
Ere blame can come he marketh it. {#67:6}

He hath his stomach full of might, the Vṛtra-slayer, Conqueror,
The Soma-drinker, ordering all. {#67:7}

In thee all treasures are combined, Soma all blessed things in thee,
Uninjured, easy to bestow. {#67:8}

To thee speeds forth my hope that craves the gift of corn, and kine and gold,
Yea, craving horses, speeds to thee. {#67:9}

Indra, through hope in thee alone even this sickle do I grasp.
Fill my hand, Maghavan, with all that it can hold of barley cut or gathered up. {#67:10}

* * *

## HYMN LXVIII. Soma.

THIS here is Soma, ne’er restrained, active, all-conquering bursting forth,
Ṛṣi and Sage by sapience, {#68:1}

All that is bare he covers o’er, all that is sick he medicines;
The blind man sees, the cripple walks. {#68:2}

Thou, Soma, givest wide defence against the hate of alien men,
Hatreds that waste and weaken us. {#68:3}

Thou by thine insight and thy skill, Impetuous One, from heaven and earth
Drivest the sinner's enmity. {#68:4}

When to their task they come with zeal, may they obtain the Giver's grace,
And satisfy his wish who thirsts. {#68:5}

So may he find what erst was lost, so may be speed the pious man,
And lengthen his remaining life. {#68:6}

Gracious, displaying tender love, unconquered, gentle in thy thoughts,
Be sweet, O Soma, to our heart. {#68:7}

O Soma, terrify us not; strike us not with alarm, O King:
Wound not our heart with dazzling flame. {#68:8}

When in my dwelling-place I see the wicked enemies of Gods,
King, chase their hatred far away, thou Bounteous One, dispel our foes. {#68:9}

* * *

## HYMN LXIX. Indra

O Sarakratu! truely I have made none else my Comforter.
Indra; be gracious unto us. {#69:1}

Thou who hast ever aided us kindly of old to win the spoil,
As such, O Indra, favour us. {#69:2}

What now? As prompter of the poor thou helpest him who sheds the juice.
Wilt thou not, Indra, strengthen us? {#69:3}

O Indra, help our chariot on, yea, Thunderer, though it lag behind:
Give this my car the foremost place. {#69:4}

Ho there! why sittest thou at case? Make thou my chariot to be first
And bring the fame of victory near. {#69:5}

Assist our car that seeks the prize. What can be easier for thee?
So make thou us victorious. {#69:6}

Indra, be firm: a fort art thou. To thine appointed place proceeds
The auspicious hymn in season due. {#69:7}

Let not our portion be disgrace. Broad is the course, the prize is set,
The barriers are opened wide. {#69:8}

This thing we wish. that thou mayst take thy fourth, thy sacrificial name.
So art thou held to be our Lord. {#69:9}

Ekadyu hath exalted you, Immortals: both Goddesses and Gods hath he delighted.
Bestow upon him bounty meet for praises. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early. {#69:10}

* * *

## HYMN LXX. Indra.

INDRA, God of the mighty arm, gather for us with thy right hand
Manifold and nutritious spoil. {#70:1}

We know thee mighty in thy deeds, of mighty bounty, mighty wealth,
Mighty in measure, prompt to aid. {#70:2}

Hero, when thou art fain to give, neither may Gods nor mortal men
Restrain thee like a fearful Bull. {#70:3}

Come, let us glorify Indra, Lord supreme of wealth, Self-ruling King:
In bounty may he harm us not. {#70:4}

Let prelude sound and following chant so let him hear the Sāman sung,
And with his bounty answer us. {#70:5}

O Indra, with thy right hand bring, and with thy left remember us.
Let us not lose our share of wealth. {#70:6}

Come nigh, O Bold One, boldly bring hither the riches of the churl
Who giveth least of all the folk. {#70:7}

Indra, the booty which thou hast with holy singers to receive,
Even that booty win with us. {#70:8}

Sounds quick in concert with our hopes. {#70:9}

HASTE forward to us from afar, or, Vṛtra-slayer, from anear,
To meet the offering to the meath. {#71:1}

Thyself with juices blent with milk. {#71:6}

The Soma, Indra, which is shed in chalices and vats for thee,
Drink thou, for thou art Lord thereof. {#71:7}

WE choose unto ourselves that high protection of the Mighty Gods
That it may help and succour us. {#72:1}

May they be ever our allies, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,
Far-seeing Gods who prosper us. {#72:2}

Ye furtherers of holy Law, transport us safe o’er many woes,
As over water-floods in ships. {#72:3}

Dear wealth be Aryaman to us, Varuṇa dear wealth meet for praise:
Dear wealth we choose unto ourselves. {#72:4}

For Sovrans of dear wealth are ye, Ādityas, not of sinner's wealth,
Ye sapient Gods who slay the foe. {#72:5}

We in our homes, ye Bounteous Ones, and while we journey on the road,

Drink thou this Soma pressed with teeth, accompanied with grain and curds, with cake of meal and song of praise. {#80:2}

Still slowly and in gradual drops, O Indu, unto Indra flow. {#80:3}

With food that gives a thousand powers. {#81:10}

We sought the wisdom of the wise. Śakra, Kine-giver, Thunder-armed!
May we with steeds o’ercome in fight. {#81:11}

We make thee, Śatakratu, find enjoyment in the songs we sing.

Thy might which no one may resist. {#82:12}

Thou in the black cows and the red and in the cows with spotted skin
This white milk hast deposited. {#82:13}

Fear of the monster fell on them. {#82:14}

The Vṛtra-slayer showed his might. {#82:15}

Him your best Vṛtra-slayer, him the famous Champion of mankind
I urge to great munificence, {#82:16}

Whene’er the Soma juice is shed. {#82:17}

The foe, to drink the Soma juice? {#82:20}

With might, onto the cleansing bath. {#82:23}

Neither might God nor mortal man accomplish what the Strong Hero wrought in full-grown vigour. {#85:2}

His head and mouth have powers that pass all others, and all his people hasten near to listen. {#85:3}

1 count thee as the Holiest of the Holy, the caster-down of what hath ne’er been shaken.
I count thee as the Banner of the heroes, I count thee as the Chief of all men living. {#85:4}

What time, O Indra, in thine arms thou tookest thy wildly rushing bolt to Slay the Dragon,
The mountains roared, the cattle loudly bellowed, the Brahmans with their hymns drew nigh to Indra. {#85:5}

Let us praise him who made these worlds and creatures, all things that after him sprang into being.
May we win Mitra with our songs, and Indra, and. wait upon our Lord with adoration. {#85:6}

Flying in terror from the snort of Vṛtra, all Deities who were thy friends forsook thee.
So, Indra, be thy friendship with the Maruts: in all these battles thou shalt be the victor. {#85:7}

Thrice-sixty Maruts, waxing strong, were with thee, like piles of beaming light, worthy of worship.
We come to thee: grant us a happy portion. Let us adore thy might with this oblation. {#85:8}

A sharpened weapon is the host of Maruts. Who, Indra, dares withstand thy bolt of thunder?
Weaponless are the Asuras, the godless: scatter them with thy wheel, Impetuous Hero. {#85:9}

Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted laid aside his weapons. {#85:13}

1 saw the Drop in the far distance moving, on the slope bank of Amsumati's river,
Like a black cloud that sank into the water. Heroes, I send you forth. Go, fight in battle. {#85:14}

And then the Drop in Amsumati's bosom, splendid with light, assumed its proper body;
And Indra, with Bṛhaspati to aid him, conquered the godless tribes that came against him. {#85:15}

Then, at thy birth, thou wast the foeman, Indra, of those the seven who ne’er had met a rival.
The hidden Pair, the Heaven and Earth, thou foundest, and to the mighty worlds thou gavest pleasure. {#85:16}

So, Thunder-armed! thou with thy bolt of thunder didst boldly smite that power which none might equal;
With weapons broughtest low the migbt of Śuṣṇa, and, Indra, foundest by thy strength the cattle. {#85:17}

Then wast thou, Chieftain of all living mortals, the very mighty slayer of the Vṛtras.
Then didst thou set the obstructed rivers flowing, and win the floods that were enthralled by Dāsas. {#85:18}

Most wise is he, rejoicing in libations, splendid as day, resistless in his anger.
He only doth great deeds, the only Hero, sole Vṛtra-slayer he, with none beside him. {#85:19}

Bards joined in song to Indra so that he might drink the Soma juice,
The Lord of Light, that he whose laws stand fast might aid with power and with the help he gives. {#86:11}

Tle holy sages form a ring, looking and singing to the Ram.
Inciters, full of vigour, not to he deceived, are with the chanters, nigh to bear. {#86:12}

As rivers swell the ocean, so, Hero, our prayers increase thy might,
Though of thyself, O Thunderer, waxing day by day. {#87:8}

With holy song mey bind to the broad wide-yoked car the Bay Steeds of the rapid God,
Bearers of Indra, yoked by word. {#87:9}

O Indra, bring great strength to us, bring valour, Śatakratu, thou most active, bring
A hero conquering in war. {#87:10}

For, gracious Śatakratu, thou hast ever been a Mother and a Sire to us,
So now for bliss we pray to thee. {#87:11}

To thee, Strong, Much-invoked, who showest forth thy strength, O Śatakratu, do I speak:
So grant thou us heroic strength. {#87:12}

## HYMN LXXXVIII. Indra.

O THUNDERER, zealous worshippers gave thee drink this time yesterday.
So, Indra, listen here to those who bring the laud: come near unto our dwellingplace. {#88:1}

Lord of Bay Steeds, fair-helmed, rejoice thee: this we crave. Here the disposers wait on thee.
Thy loftiest glories claim our lauds beside the juice, O Indra, Lover of the Song. {#88:2}

Turning, as ’twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good things.
When he who will be born is born with power we look to treasures as our heritage. {#88:3}

Praise him who sends us wealth, whose bounties injure none: good are the gifts which Indra. grants.
He is not worth with one who satisfies his wish: he turns his mind to giving boons. {#88:4}

Thou in thy battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.
Father art thou, aIl-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor of the vanquisher. {#88:5}

The Earth and Heaven clung close to thy victorious might as to their calf two mother-cows.
When thou attackest Vṛtra all the hostile bands shrink and faint, Indra, at thy wrath. {#88:6}

Bring to your aid the Eternal One, who shoots and none may shoot at him,
Inciter, swift, victorious, best of Charioteers. Tugrya's unvanquished Strengthener; {#88:7}

Arranger of things unarranged, e’en Śatakratu, source of might,
Indra, the Friend of all, for succour we invoke, Guardian of treasure, sendjng wealth. {#88:8}

* * *

## HYMN LXXXIX Indra. Vāk.

I MOVE before thee here present in person, and all the Deities follow behind me.
When, Indra, thou securest me my portion, with me thou shalt perform heroic actions. {#89:1}

The food of meath in foremost place I give thee, thy Soma shall be pressed, thy share appointed.
Thou on my right shalt be my friend and comrade: then shall we two smite dead full many a foeman. {#89:2}

Striving for strength bring forth a laud to Indra, a truthful hymn if he in truth existeth.
One and another say, There is no Indra. Who hath beheld him? Whom then shall we honour? {#89:3}

Here am I, look upon me here, O singer. All that existeth 1 surpass in greatness.
The Holy Law's commandments make me mighty. Rending with strength I rend the worlds asunder. {#89:4}

When the Law's lovers mounted and ap. proached me as 1 sate lone upon the dear sky's summit.
Then spake my spirit to the heart within me, My friends have cried unto me with their children. {#89:5}

All these thy deeds must be declared at Soma-feasts, wrought, Indra, Bounteous Lord, for him who sheds the juice,
When thou didst open wealth heaped up by many, brought from far away to Sarablia, the Ṛṣi's kin. {#89:6}

Now run ye forth your several ways: he is not here who kept you back.
For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in Vṛtra's vital part? {#89:7}

On-rushing with the speed of thought within the iron fort he pressed:
The Falcon went to heaven and brought the Soma to the Thunderer. {#89:8}

Deep in the ocean lies the bolt with waters compassed round about,
And in continuous onward flow the floods their tribute bring to it. {#89:9}

When, uttering words which no one comprehended, Vāk, Queen of Gods, the Gladdener, was seated,
The heaven's four regions drew forth drink and vigour: now whither hath her noblest portion vanished? {#89:10}

The Deities generated Vāk the Goddess, and animals of every figure speak her.
May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour, the Milch-cow Vāk, approach us meetly lauded. {#89:11}

Step forth with wider stride, my comrade Viṣṇu; make room, Dyaus, for the leaping of the lightning.
Let us slay Vṛtra, let us free the rivers let them flow loosed at the command of Indra. {#89:12}

* * *

YEA, specially that mortal man hath toiled for service of the Gods,
Who quickly hath brought near Mitra and Varuṇa. to share his sacrificial gifts. {#90:1}

Both of you, furthering our eastward-offcred praise, come, Chiefs whom Jamadagni lauds! {#90:8}

Poured on the middle of the strainingcloth, and cooked, this bright drink hath been offered ilice. {#90:9}

He comes by straightest paths, as ministering Priest, to taste the sacrificial gifts.
Then, Lord of harnessed teams I drink of the twofold draught, bright Soma mingled with the milk. {#90:10}

Verily, Sūrya, thou art great; truly, Āditya, thou art great.
As thou art great indeed, thy greatness is admired: yea, verily, thou, God, art great. {#90:11}

Yea, Sūrya, thou art great in fame thou evermore, O God, art great.
Thou by thy greatness art the Gods’ High Priest, divine, far-spread unconquerable light. {#90:12}

She yonder, bending lowly down, clothed in red hues and rich in rays,
Is seen, advancing as it were with various tints, amid the ten surrounding arms. {#90:13}

Past and gone are three mortal generations: the fourth and last into the Sun hath entered.
He mid the worlds his lofty place hath taken. Into green plants is gone the Purifying. {#90:14}

The Rudras' Mother, Daughter of the Vasus, centre of nectar, the Ādityas’ Sister-
To folk who understand will 1 proclaim it-injure not Aditi, the Cow, the sinless. {#90:15}

Weak-minded men have as a cow adopted me who came hither from the Gods, a Goddess,
Who, skilled in eloquence, her voice uplifteth, who standeth near at hand with all devotions. {#90:16}

Yet what is here I bring to thee. {#91:19}

O Agni, whatsoever be the fuel that we lay for thee,
Be pleased therewith, Most Youthful God {#91:20}

That which the white-ant cats away, that over which the emmet crawls-
May all of this be oil to thee. {#91:21}

I with the priests have kindled him. {#91:22}

## HYMN XCII. Agni

THAT noblest Furtherer hath appeared, to whom men bring their holy works.
Our songs of praise have risen aloft to Agni who was barn to give the Ārya strength. {#92:1}

Agni of Divodāsa turned, as ’twere in majesty, to the Gods.
Onward he sped along the mother earth, and took his station in the height of heaven. {#92:2}

Him before whom the people shrink when he performs his glorious deeds,
Him who wins thousands at the worship of the Gods, himself, that Agni, serve with son s. {#92:3}

The mortal man whom thou wouldst lead to opulence, O Vasu, he who brings thee gifts.
He, Agni, wins himself a hero singing lauds, yea, one who feeds a thousand men. {#92:4}

He with the steed wins spoil even in the fenced fort, and gains imperishable fame.
In thee, O Lord of wealth, continually we lay all precious offerings to the Gods. {#92:5}

To him who dealeth out all wealth, who is the cheerful Priest of men,
To him, like the first vessels filled with savoury juice, to Agni go the songs of praise. {#92:6}

On both, Strong Lord of men! on child and grandson pour the bounties which our nobles give. {#92:7}

Sing forth to him, the Holy, most munificent, sublime with his refulgent glow,
To Agni, ye Upastutas. {#92:8}

Priest, presser of the juice! praise now the dearest Guest of all our friends,
Agni, the driver of the cars. {#92:10}

## HYMN I. Indra.

TO you will I sing Indra's praise who gives good gifts as well we know;
The praise of Maghavan who, rich in treasure, aids his singers with wealth thousandfold. {#1:1}

As with a hundred hosts, he rushes boldly on, and for the offerer slays his foes.
As from a mountain flow the water-brooks, thus flow his gifts who feedeth many a one. {#1:2}

The drops effused, the gladdening draughts, O Indra, Lover of the Son
As waters seek the lake where they are wont to rest, fill thee, for bounty, Thunderer. {#1:3}

The matchless draught that strengthens and gives eloquence, the sweetest of the meath drink thou,
That in thy joy thou maysi scatter thy gifts o’er us, plenteously, even as the dust. {#1:4}

Come quickly to our laud, urged on by Soma-pressers like a horse-
Laud, Godlike Indra, which milch-kine make sweet for thee: with Kaṇva's sons are gifts for thee. {#1:5}

With homage have we sought thee as a Hero, strong, preeminent, with unfailing wealth.
O Thunderer, as a plenteous spring pours forth its stream, so, Indra, flow our songs to thee. {#1:6}

If now thou art at sacrifice, or if thou art upon the earth,
Come thence, high-thoughted! to our sacrifice with the Swift, come, Mighty with the Mighty Ones. {#1:7}

The active, fleet-foot, tawny Coursers that are thine are swift to victory, like the Wind,
Wherewith thou goest round to visit Manus' seed, wherewith all heaven is visible. {#1:8}

Indra, from thee so great we crave prosperity in wealth of kine,
As, Maghavan, thou favouredst Medhyātithi, and, in the fight, Nipatithi. {#1:9}

As, Indra, to Gosarya and Ṛjiśvan, thou vouchsafedst wealth in kine and gold. {#1:10}

## HYMN II. Indra.

SAKRA I praise, to win his aid, far-famed, exceeding bountiful,
Who gives, as ’twere in thousands, precious wealth to him who sheds the juice and worships him. {#2:1}

Arrows with hundred points, unconquerable, are this Indra's n-dghty arms in war.
He streams on liberal worshippers like a hill with springs, when juices poured have gladdened him. {#2:2}

What time the flowing Soma-drops have gladdened with their taste the Friend,
Like water, gracious Lord! were my libations made, like milch-kine to the worshipper. {#2:3}

To him the peerless, who is calling you to give you aid, forth flow the drops of pleasant meath.
The Soloa-drops which call on thee, O gracious Lord, have brought thee to our hymn of praise. {#2:4}

He rushes hurrying like a steed to Soma that adorns our rite,
Which hymns make sweet to thee, lover of pleasant food. The call to Paura thou dost love. {#2:5}

Praise the strong, grasping Hero, winner of the spoil, ruling supreme oer mighty wealth.
Like a full spring, O Thunderer, from thy store hast thou poured on the worshipper evermore. {#2:6}

Now whether thou be far away, or in the heavens, or on the earth,
O Indra, mighty- thoughted, harnessing thy Bays, come Lofty with the Lofty Ones. {#2:7}

The Bays who draw thy chariot, Steeds who injure none, surpass the wind's impetuous strength-
With whom thou silencest the enemy of man, with whon; thou goest round the sky. {#2:8}

O gracious Hero, may we learn anew to know thee as thou art:
As in decisive fight thou holpest Etaśa, or Vaśa 'gainst Dasavraja, {#2:9}

As, Maghavan, to Kaṇva at the sacred feast, to Dirghanitha thine home-friend,
As to Gosarya thou, Stone-darter, gavest wealth, give me a gold-bright stall of kine. {#2:10}

* * *

## HYMN III. Indra.

As with Manu Samvarani, Indra, thou drankest Soma juice,
And, Maghavan, with Nipatithi, Medbyatithi, with Pustigu and Srustigu,— {#3:1}

T'he son of Prsadvana was Praskaniva's host, who lay decrepit and forlorn.
Aided by thee the Ṛṣi Dasyave-vrka strove to obtain thousands of kine. {#3:2}

Call hither with thy newest song Indra who lacks not hymns of praise,
Him who observes and knows, inspirer of the sage, him who seems eager to enjoy. {#3:3}

He unto whom they sang the seven-headed hymn, three-parted, in the loftiest place,
He sent his thunder down on all these living things, and so displayed heroic might. {#3:4}

We invocate that Indra who bestoweth precious things on us.
Now do we know his newest favour; may we gain a stable that is full of kine. {#3:5}

He whom thou aidest, gracious Lord, to give again, obtains great wealth to nourish him.
We with our Soma ready, Lover of the Song! call, Indra Maghavan, on thee. {#3:6}

Ne’er art thou fruitless, Indra ne’er dost thou desert the worshipper
But now, O Maghavan, thy bounty as a God is poured forth ever more and more. {#3:7}

He who hath. overtaken Krvi with his might, and silenced Śuṣṇa with deathbolts,—
When he supported yonder heaven and spread it out, then first the son of earth was born. {#3:8}

Good Lord of wealth is he to whom all Āryas, Dāsas here belong.
Directly unto thee, the pious Ruśama Paviru, is that wealth brought nigh. {#3:9}

In zealous haste the singers have sung forth a song distilling oil and rich in sweets.
Riches have spread among us and heroic strength, with us are flowing Soma-drops. {#3:10}

## HYMN IV. Indra.

As, Śakra, thou with Manu called Vivasvān drankest Soma juice,
As, Indra, thou didst love the hymn by Trita's side, so dost thou joy with Āyu now. {#4:1}

As thou with Mātariśvan, Medhya, Prsadhra, hast cheered thee Indra, with pressed juice,
Drunk Soma with Rjunas, Syūmaraśmi, by Dasonya's Dasasipra's side. {#4:2}

’Tis he who made the lauds his own and boldly drank the Soma juice,
He to whom Viṣṇu came striding his three wide steps, as Mitra's statutes ordered it. {#4:3}

In whose laud thou didst joy, Indra, at the great deed, O Śatakratu, Mighty One!
Seeking renown we call thee as the milkers call the cow who yields abundant milk. {#4:4}

He is our Sire who gives to us, Great, Mighty, ruling as he wills.
Unsought, may he the Strong, Rich, Lord of ample wealth, give us of horses and of kine. {#4:5}

He to whom thou, Good Lord, givest that he may give increases wealth that nourishes.
Eager for wealth we call on Indra, Lord of wealth, on Śatakratu with our lauds. {#4:6}

Never art thou neglectful: thou guardest both races with thy care.
The call on Indra, fourth Āditya! is thine own. Amṛta is stablished in the heavens. {#4:7}

The offercr whom thou, Indra, Lover of the Song, liberal Maghavan, favourest,—
As at the call of Kaṇva so, O gracious Lord, hear, thou our songs and eulogy. {#4:8}

Sung is the song of ancient time: to Indra have ye said the prayer.
They have sung many a Brhati of sacrifice, poured forth the worshipper's many thoughts. {#4:9}

Indra hath tossed together mighty stores of wealth, and both the worlds, yea, and the Sun.
Pure, brightly-shining, mingled with the milk, the draughts of Soma have made Indra glad. {#4:10}

## HYMN V. Indra.

As highest of the Maghavans, preeminent among the Bulls,
Best breaker-down of forts, kine-winner, Lord of wealth, we seek thee, Indra Maghavan. {#5:1}

Thou who subduedst Āyu, Kutsa, Atithigva, waxing daily in thy might,
As such, rousing thy power, we invocate thee now, thee Śatakratu, Lord of Bays. {#5:2}

The pressing-stones shall pour for us the essence of the meath of all,
Drops that have been pressed out afar among the folk, and those that have been pressed near us. {#5:3}

Repel all enmities and keep thern far away: let all win treasure for their own.
Even among Sistas are the stalks that make thee glad, where thou with Soma satest thee. {#5:4}

Come, Indra, very near to us with aids of firmly-based resolve;
Come, most auspicious, with thy most auspicious help, good Kinsman, with good kinsmen, come! {#5:5}

Bless thou with progeny the chief of men, the lord of heroes, victor in the fray.
Aid with thy powers the men who sing thee lauds and keep their spirits ever pure and bright. {#5:6}

May we be such in battle as are surest to obtain thy grace:
With holy offerings and invocations of the Gods, we mean, that we may win the spoil. {#5:7}

Thine, Lord of Bays, am I. Prayer longeth for the spoil. Still with thy help I seek the fight.
So, at the raiders' head, I, craving steeds and kine, unite myself with thee alone. {#5:8}

## HYMN VI. Indra.

INDRA, the poets with. their hymns extol this hero might of thine:
They strengthened, loud in song, thy power that droppeth oil. With hymns the Pauras came to thee. {#6:1}

Through piety they came to Indra for his aid, they whose libations give theejoy.
As thou with, Krsa and Samvarta hast rejoiced, so, Indra, be thou glad with us. {#6:2}

Agreeing in your spirit, all ye Deities, come nigh to us.
Vasus and Rudras shall come near to give us aid, and Maruts listen to our call. {#6:3}

May Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, and Sarasvatī befriend, and the Seven Streams, this call of mine:
May Waters, Wind, the Mountains, and the Forest-Lord, and Earth give ear unto my cry. {#6:4}

Indra, with thine own bounteous gift, most liberal of the Mighty Ones,
Be our boon benefactor, Vṛtra-slayer, be our feast-companion for our weal. {#6:5}

Leader of heroes, Lord of battle, lead thou us to combat, thou Most Sapient One.
High fame is theirs who win by invocations, feasts and entertainment of the Gods. {#6:6}

Our hopes rest on the Faithful One: in Indra is the people's life.
O Maghavan, come nigh that thou mayst give us aid: make plenteous food stream forth for us. {#6:7}

Thee would we worship, Indra, with our songs of praise: O Śatakratu, be thou ours.
Pour down upon Praskaṇva bounty vast and firm, exuberant, that shall never fail. {#6:8}

## HYMN VII. Praskaṇva's Gift.

GREAT, verily, is Indra's might. I have beheld, and hither comes
Thy bounty, Dasyave-vrka! {#7:1}

A hundred oxen white of hue are shining like the stars in heaven,
So tall, they seem to prop the sky. {#7:2}

Bamboos a hundred, a hundred dogs, a hundred skins of beasts well-tanned,
A hundred tufts of Balbaja, four hundred red-hued mares are mine. {#7:3}

Blest by the Gods, Kinvayanas! be ye who spread through life on life:
Like horses have ye stridden forth. {#7:4}

Then men extolled the team of seven not yet full-grown, its fame is great.
The dark mares rushed along the paths, so that no eye could follow them. {#7:5}

* * *

## HYMN VIII Praskaṇva's Go.

THY bounty, Dasyave-vrka, exhaustless hath displayed itself:
Its fulness is as broad as heaven. {#8:1}

Ten thousand Dasyave-vrka, the son of Putakrata, hath
From his own wealth bestowed on me. {#8:2}

A hundred asses hath he given, a hundred head of fleecy sheep,
A hundred slaves, and wreaths besides. {#8:3}

There also was a mare led forth, picked out for Putakrata's sake,
Not of the horses of the herd. {#8:4}

Observant Agni hath appeared, oblation-bearer with his car.
Agni with his resplendent flame hath shone on high as shines the Sun, hath shone like Sūrya in theheavens. {#8:5}

* * *

## HYMN IX. Aśvins.

ENDOWED, O Gods, with your primeval wisdom, come quickly with your chariot, O ye Holy.
Come with your mighty powers, O ye Nāsatyas; come hither, drink ye this the third libation. {#9:1}

The truthful Deities, the Three-and-Thirty, saw you approach before the Ever-Truthful.
Accepting this our worship and libation, O Aśvins bright with fire, drink ye the Soma. {#9:2}

Aśvins, that work of yours deserves our wonder,—the Bull of heaven and earth and air's mid region;
Yea, and your thousand promises in battle, -to all of these come near and drink beside us. {#9:3}

Here is your portion laid for you, ye Holy: come to these songs of ours, O ye Nāsatyas.
Drink among us the Soma full of sweetness, and with your powers assist the man who worships. {#9:4}

## HYMN X. Viśvedevas.

HE whom the priests in sundry ways arranging the sacrifice, of one accord, bring hither,
Who was appointed as a learned Brahman, -what is the sacrificer's knowledge of him? {#10:1}

Kindled in many a spot, still One is Agni; Silrya is One though high o’er all he shineth.
Illumining this All, still One is usas. That which is One hath into All developed. {#10:2}

The chariot bright and radiant, treasure-laden, three-wheeled, with easy seat, and lightly rolling,
Which She of Wondrous Wealth was born to harness,—this car of yours I call. Drink what remaineth. {#10:3}

* * *

## HYMN XI. Indra-Varuṇa.

IN offerings poured to you, O Indra-Varuṇa, these shares of yours stream forth to glorify your state.
Ye haste to the libations at each sacrifice when ye assist the worshipper who sheds the juice. {#11:1}

The waters and the plants, O Indra-Varuṇa, had efficacious vigour, and attained to might:
Ye who have gone beyond the path of middle air,—no godless man is worthy to be called your foe. {#11:2}

True is your Krsa's word, Indra and Varuṇa: The seven holy voices pour a wave of meath.
For their sake, Lords of splendour! aid the pious man who, unbewildered, keeps you ever in his thoughts. {#11:3}

Dropping oil, sweet with Soma, pouring forth their stream, are the Seven Sisters in the seat of sacrifice.
These, dropping oil, are yours, O Indra-Varuṇa: with these enrich with gifts and help the worshipper. {#11:4}

To our great happiness have we ascribed to these Two Bright Ones truthfulness, great strength, and majesty.
O Lords of splendour, aid us through the Three-times-Seven, as we pour holy oil, O Indra-Varuṇa. {#11:5}

What ye in time of old Indra and Varuṇa, gave Ṛṣis revelation, thought, and power of song,
And places which the wise made, weaving sacrifice,—these through my spirit's fervid glow have I beheld., {#11:6}

O Indra-Varuṇa, grant to the worshippers cheerfulness void of pride, and wealth to nourish them. {#11:7}
