## HYMN I. Agni

Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch-cow.
Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of heaven. {#1:1}

For worship of the Gods the Priest was wakened: at morning gracious Agni hath arisen.
Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set free from darkness. {#1:2}

When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk pure Agni is anointed.
The strength-bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front, with tongues, erect, he drinketh. {#1:3}

The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to Sūrya.
He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at daybreak as a strong white charger. {#1:4}

The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the well-laid fuel.
Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Priest most skilled in worship. {#1:5}

Agni hath sat him down, a Priest most skilful, on a sweet-smelling place, his Mother's bosom.
Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o’er many, kindled among the folk whom he sustaineth. {#1:6}

This Singer excellent at sacrifices, Agni the Priest, they glorify with homage.
Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong Steed who never faileth. {#1:7}

He, worshipful House-Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own auspicious guest, lauded by sages.
That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni, thou excellest others. {#1:8}

Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast appeared most lovely,
Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of the people. {#1:9}

To thee, Most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the people bring their tribute.
Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high, auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter. {#1:10}

Ascend to-day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy Ones around it.
Knowing the paths by mid-air's spacious region bring hither Gods to feast on our oblation. {#1:11}

To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song of praise and homage.
Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far-reaching, like gold light to heaven. {#1:12}

* * *

## HYMN II. Agni.

THE youthful Mother keeps the Boy in secret pressed to her close, nor yields him to the Father.
But, when he lies upon the arm, the people see his unfading countenance before them. {#2:1}

What child is this thou carriest as handmaid, O Youthful One? The Consort-Queen hath borne him.
The Babe unborn increased through many autumns. I saw him born what time his Mother bare him. {#2:2}

I saw him from afar gold-toothed, bright-coloured, hurling his weapons from his habitation,
What time I gave him Amṛta free from mixture. How can the Indraless, the hymnless harm me? {#2:3}

I saw him moving from the place he dwells in, even as with a herd, brilliantly shining.
These seized him not: he had been born already. They who were grey with age again grow youthful. {#2:4}

Who separate my young bull from the cattle, they whose protector was in truth no stranger?
Let those whose hands have seized upon them free them. May he, observant, drive the herd to us-ward. {#2:5}

Mid mortal men godless have secreted the King of all who live, home of the people.
So may the prayers of Atri give him freedom. Reproached in turn be those who now reproach him. {#2:6}

Thou from the stake didst loose e’en Śunaḥśepa bound for a thousand; for he prayed with fervour.
So, Agni, loose from us the bonds that bind us, when thou art seated here, O Priest who knowest. {#2:7}

Thou hast sped from me, Agni, in thine anger: this the protector of Gods’ Laws hath told me.
Indra who knoweth bent his eye upon thee: by him instructed am I come, O Agni. {#2:8}

Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his greatness makes all things apparent.
He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens both his horns to gore the Rakṣas. {#2:9}

Loud in the heaven above be Agni's roarings with keen-edged weapons to destroy the demons.
Forth burst his splendours in the Soma's rapture. The godless bands press round but cannot stay him. {#2:10}

As a skilled craftsman makes a car, a singer I, Mighty One! this hymn for thee have fashioned.
If thou, O Agni, God, accept it gladly, may we obtain thereby the heavenly Waters. {#2:11}

May he, the strong-necked Steer, waxing in vigour, gather the foeman's wealth with none to check him.
Thus to this Agni have the Immortals spoken. To man who spreads the grass may he grant shelter, grant shelter to the man who brings oblation. {#2:12}

* * *

## HYMN III. Agni.

THOU at thy birth art Varuṇa, O Agni; when thou art kindled thou becomest Mitra.
In thee, O Son of Strength, all Gods are centred. Indra art thou to man who brings oblation. {#3:1}

Aryaman art thou as regardeth maidens mysterious, is thy name, O Self-sustainer.
As a kind friend with streams of milk they balm thee what time thou makest wife and lord one-minded. {#3:2}

The Maruts deck their beauty for thy glory, yea, Rudra! for thy birth fair, brightly-coloured.
That which was fixed as Viṣṇu's loftiest station—therewith the secret of the Cows thou guardest. {#3:3}

Gods through thy glory, God who art so lovely! granting abundant gifts gained life immortal.
As their own Priest have men established Agni; and serve him fain for praise from him who liveth. {#3:4}

There is no priest more skilled than thou in worship; none Self-sustainer pass thee in wisdom.
The man within whose house as guest thou dwellest, O God, by sacrifice shall conquer mortals. {#3:5}

Aided by thee, O Agni may we conquer through our oblation, fain for wealth, awakened:
May we in battle, in the days’ assemblies, O Son of Strength, by riches conquer mortals. {#3:6}

He shall bring evil on the evil-plotter whoever turns against us sin and outrage.
Destroy this calumny of him, O Agni, whoever injures us with double-dealing. {#3:7}

At this dawn's flushing, God! our ancient fathers served thee with offerings, making thee their envoy,
When, Agni, to the store of wealth thou goest, a God enkindled with good things by mortals. {#3:8}

Save, thou who knowest, draw thy father near thee, who counts as thine own son, O Child of Power.
O sapient Agni, when wilt thou regard us? When, skilled in holy Law, wilt thou direct us? {#3:9}

Adoring thee he gives thee many a title, when thou, Good Lord! acceptest this as Father.
And doth not Agni, glad in strength of Godhead, gain splendid bliss when he hath waxen mighty? {#3:10}

Most Youthful Agni, verily thou bearest thy praiser safely over all his troubles.
Thieves have been seen by us and open foemen: unknown have been the plottings of the wicked. {#3:11}

To thee these eulogies have been directed: or to the Vasu hath this sin been spoken.
But this our Agni, flaming high, shall never yield us to calumny, to him who wrongs us. {#3:12}

* * *

## HYMN IV. Agni.

O AGNI, King and Lord of wealth and treasures, in thee is my delight at sacrifices.
Through thee may we obtain the strength we long for, and overcome the fierce attacks of mortals. {#4:1}

Agni, Eternal Father, offering-bearer, fair to behold, far-reaching, far-refulgent,
From well-kept household fire beam food to feed us, and measure out to us abundant glory. {#4:2}

The Sage of men, the Lord of human races, pure, purifying Agni, balmed with butter,
Him the Omniscient as your Priest ye stablish: he wins among the Gods things worth the choosing. {#4:3}

Agni, enjoy, of one accord with Iḷā, striving in rivalry with beams of Sūrya,
Enjoy, O Jātavedas, this our fuel, and bring the Gods to us to taste oblations. {#4:4}

As dear House-Friend, guest welcome in the dwelling, to this our sacrifice come thou who knowest.
And, Agni, having scattered all assailants, bring to us the possessions of our foemen. {#4:5}

Drive thou away the Dasyu with thy weapon. As, gaining vital power for thine own body,
O Son of Strength, the Gods thou satisfiest, so in fight save us, most heroic Agni. {#4:6}

May we, O Agni, with our lauds adore thee, and with our gifts, fair-beaming Purifier!
Send to us wealth containing all things precious: bestow upon us every sort of riches. {#4:7}

Son of Strength, Agni, dweller in three regions, accept our sacrifice and our oblation.
Among the Gods may we be counted pious: protect us with a triply-guarding shelter. {#4:8}

Over all woes and dangers, Jātavedas, bear us as in a boat across a river.
Praised with our homage even as Atri praised thee, O Agni, be the guardian of our bodies. {#4:9}

As I, remembering thee with grateful spirit, a mortal, call with might on thee Immortal,
Vouchsafe us high renown, O Jātavedas, and may I be immortal by my children. {#4:10}

The pious man, O Jātavedas Agni, to whom thou grantest ample room and pleasure,
Gaineth abundant wealth with sons and horses, with heroes and with kine for his well-being. {#4:11}

* * *

## HYMN V. Āprīs.

To Agni, Jātavedas, to the flame, the well-enkindled God,
Offer thick sacrificial oil. {#5:1}

He, Narāśaṁsa, ne’er beguiled, inspiriteth this sacrifice:
For sage is he, with sweets in hand. {#5:2}

Adored, O Agni, hither bring Indra the Wonderful, the Friend,
On lightly-rolling car to aid. {#5:3}

Spread thyself out, thou soft as wool The holy hymns have sung to thee.
Bring gain to us, O beautiful! {#5:4}

Open yourselves, ye Doors Divine, easy of access for our aid:
Fill, more and more, the sacrifice. {#5:5}

Fair strengtheners of vital power, young Mothers of eternal Law,
Morning and Night we supplicate. {#5:6}

On the wind's flight come, glorified, ye two celestial Priests of man
Come ye to this our sacrifice. {#5:7}

Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Mahī, three Goddesses who bring us weal,
Be seated harmless on the grass. {#5:8}

Rich in all plenty, Tvaṣṭar, come auspicious of thine own accord
Help us in every sacrifice. {#5:9}

Vanaspati, wherever thou knowest the Gods’ mysterious names,
Send our oblations thitherward. {#5:10}

To Agni and to Varuṇa, Indra, the Maruts, and the Gods,
With Svāhā be oblation brought. {#5:11}

* * *

## HYMN VI. Agni.

I VALUE Agni that good Lord, the home to which the kine return:
Whom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring steeds as home. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:1}

’Tis Agni whom we laud as good, to whom the milch-kine come in herds,
To whom the chargers swift of foot, to whom our well-born princes come. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:2}

Agni the God of all mankind, gives, verily, a steed to man.
Agni gives precious gear for wealth, treasure he gives when he is pleased. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:3}

God, Agni, we will kindle thee, rich in thy splendour, fading not,
So that this glorious fuel may send forth by day its light for thee. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:4}

To thee the splendid, Lord of flame, bright, wondrous, Prince of men, is brought.
Oblation with the holy verse, O Agni, bearer of our gifts.
Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:5}

These Agnis in the seats of the fire nourish each thing most excellent.
They give delight, they spread abroad, they move themselves continually. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:6}

Agni, these brilliant flames of thine wax like strong chargers mightily,
Who with the treadings of their hoofs go swiftly to the stalls of kine. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:7}

To us who laud thee, Agni, bring fresh food and safe and happy homes.
May we who have sung hymns to thee have thee for envoy in each house. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:8}

Thou, brilliant God, within thy mouth warmest both ladles of the oil.
So fill us also, in our hymns, abundantly, O Lord of Strength. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:9}

Thus Agni have we duly served with sacrifices and with hymns.
So may he give us what we crave, store of brave sons and fleet-foot steeds. Bring food to those who sing thy praise. {#6:10}

* * *

## HYMN VII. Agni.

OFFER to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly praise;
To him supremest o’er the folk, the Son of Strength, the mighty Lord: {#7:1}

Him in whose presence, when they meet in full assembly, men rejoice;
Even him whom worthy ones inflame, and living creatures bring to life. {#7:2}

When we present to him the food and sacrificial gifts of men,
He by the might of splendour grasps the holy Ordinance's rein. {#7:3}

He gives a signal in the night even to him who is afar,
When he, the Bright, unchanged by eld, consumes the sovrans of the wood. {#7:4}

He in whose service on the ways they offer up their drops of sweat,
On him is their high kin have they mounted, as ridges on the earth. {#7:5}

Whom, sought of many, mortal man hath found to be the Stay of all;
He who gives flavour to our food, the home of every man that lives. {#7:6}

Even as a herd that crops the grass he shears the field and wilderness,
With flashing teeth and beard of gold, deft with his unabated might. {#7:7}

For him, to whom, bright as an axe he, as to Atri, hath flashed forth,
Hath the well-bearing Mother borne, producing when her time is come. {#7:8}

Agni to whom the oil is shed by him thou lovest to support,
Bestow upon these mortals fame and splendour and intelligence. {#7:9}

Such zeal hath he, resistless one: he gained the cattle given by thee.
Agni, may Atri overcome the Dasyus who bestow no gifts, subdue the men who give no food. {#7:10}

* * *

## HYMN VIII. Agni.

O AGNI urged to strength, the men of old who loved the Law enkindled thee,
the Ancient, for their aid,
Thee very bright, and holy, nourisher of all, most excellent, the Friend and Master of the home. {#8:1}

Thee, Agni, men have stablished as their guest of old, as Master of the household, thee, with hair of flame;
High-bannered, multiform, distributor of wealth, kind helper, good protector, drier of the floods. {#8:2}

The tribes of men praise thee, Agni, who knowest well burnt offerings, the Discerner, lavishest of wealth,
Dwelling in secret, Blest One! visible to all, loud-roaring, skilled in worship, glorified with oil. {#8:3}

Ever to thee, O Agni, as exceeding strong have we drawn nigh with songs and reverence singing hymns.
So be thou pleased with us, Aṅgiras! as a God enkindled by the noble with man's goodly light. {#8:4}

Thou, Agni! multiform, God who art lauded much! givest in every house subsistence as of old.
Thou rulest by thy might o’er food of many a sort: that light of thine when blazing may not be opposed. {#8:5}

The Gods, Most Youthful Agni, have made thee, inflamed, the bearer of oblations and the messenger.
Thee, widely-reaching, homed in sacred oil, invoked, effulgent, have they made the Eye that stirs the thought. {#8:6}

Men seeking joy have lit thee worshipped from of old, O Agni, with good fuel and with sacred oil.
So thou, bedewed and waxing mighty by the plants, spreadest thyself abroad over the realms of earth. {#8:7}

* * *

## HYMN IX. Agni.

BEARING; oblations mortal men, O Agni, worship thee the God.
I deem thee Jātavedas: bear our offerings, thou, unceasingly. {#9:1}

In the man's home who offers gifts, where grass is trimmed, Agni is Priest,
To whom all sacrifices come and strengthenings that win renown. {#9:2}

Whom, as an infant newly-born, the kindling-sticks have brought to life,
Sustainer of the tribes of men, skilled in well-ordered sacrifice. {#9:3}

Yea, very hard art thou to grasp, like offspring of the wriggling snakes,
When thou consumest many woods like an ox, Agni, in the mead. {#9:4}

Whose flames, when thou art sending forth the smoke, completely reach the mark,
When Tṛta in the height of heaven, like as a smelter fanneth thee, e’en as a smelter sharpeneth thee. {#9:5}

O Agni, by thy succour and by Mitra's friendly furtherance,
May we, averting hate, subdue the wickedness of mortal men. {#9:6}

O Agni, to our heroes bring such riches, thou victorious God.
May he protect and nourish us, and help in gaining strength: be thou near us in fight for our success. {#9:7}

* * *

## HYMN X. Agni.

BRING us most mighty splendour thou, Agni, resistless on thy way.
With overflowing store of wealth mark out for us a path to strength. {#10:1}

Ours art thou, wondrous Agni, by wisdom and bounteousness of power.
The might of Asuras rests on thee, like Mitra worshipful in act. {#10:2}

Agni, increase our means of life, increase the house and home of these,
The men, the princes who have won great riches through our hymns of praise. {#10:3}

Bright Agni, they who deck their songs for thee have horses as their meed.
The men are mighty in their might, they whose high laud, as that of heaven, awakes thee of its own accord. {#10:4}

O Agni, those resplendent flames of thine go valorously forth,
Like lightnings flashing round us, like a rattling car that seeks the spoil. {#10:5}

Now, Agni, come to succour us; let priests draw nigh to offer gifts;
And let the patrons of our rites subdue all regions of the earth. {#10:6}

Bring to us, Agni, Aṅgiras, lauded of old and lauded now,
Invoker! wealth to quell the strong, that singers may extol thee. Be near us in fight for our success. {#10:7}

* * *

## HYMN XI. Agni.

THE watchful Guardian of the people hath been born, Agni, the very strong, for fresh prosperity.
With oil upon his face, with high heaven-touching flame, he shineth splendidly, pure, for the Bharatas. {#11:1}

Ensign of sacrifice, the earliest Household-Priest, the men have kindled Agni in his threefold seat,
With Indra and the Gods together on the grass let the wise Priest sit to complete the sacrifice. {#11:2}

Pure , unadorned, from thy two Mothers art thou born: thou camest from Vivasvān as a charming Sage.
With oil they strengthened thee, O Agni, worshipped God: thy banner was the smoke that mounted to the sky. {#11:3}

May Agni graciously come to our sacrifice. The men bear Agni here and there in every house.
He hath become an envoy, bearer of our gifts: electing Agni, men choose one exceeding wise. {#11:4}

For thee, O Agni, is this sweetest prayer of mine: dear to thy spirit be this product of my thought.
As great streams fill the river so our song of praise fill thee, and make thee yet more mighty in thy strength. {#11:5}

O Agni, the Aṅgirases discovered thee what time thou layest hidden, fleeing back from wood to wood.
Thou by attrition art produced as conquering might, and men, O Aṅgiras, call thee the Son of Strength. {#11:6}

* * *

## HYMN XII. Agni.

To Agni, lofty Asura, meet for worship, Steer of eternal Law, my prayer I offer;
I bring my song directed to the Mighty like pure oil for his mouth at sacrifices. {#12:1}

Mark the Law, thou who knowest, yea, observe it: send forth the full streams of eternal Order.
I use no sorcery with might or falsehood the sacred Law of the Red Steer I follow. {#12:2}

How hast thou, follower of the Law eternal, become the knower of a new song, Agni?
The God, the Guardian of the seasons, knows me: the Lord of him who won this wealth I know not. {#12:3}

Who, Agni, in alliance with thy foeman, what splendid helpers won for them their riches?
Agni, who guard the dwelling-place of falsehood? Who are protectors of the speech of liars? {#12:4}

Agni, those friends of thine have turned them from thee: gracious of old, they have become ungracious.
They have deceived themselves by their own speeches, uttering wicked words against the righteous. {#12:5}

He who pays sacrifice to thee with homage, O Agni, keeps the Red Steer's Law eternal;
Wide is his dwelling. May the noble offspring of Nahuṣa who wandered forth come hither. {#12:6}

* * *

## HYMN XIII. Agni.

WITH songs of praise we call on thee, we kindle thee with songs of praise,
Agni, with songs of praise, for help. {#13:1}

Eager for wealth, we meditate Agni's effectual praise to-day,
Praise of the God who touches heaven. {#13:2}

May Agni, Priest among mankind, take pleasure in our songs of praise,
And worship the Celestial Folk. {#13:3}

Thou, Agni, art spread widely forth, Priest dear and excellent; through thee
Men make the sacrifice complete. {#13:4}

Singers exalt thee, Agni, well lauded, best giver of our strength:
So grant thou us heroic might. {#13:5}

Thou Agni, as the felly rings the spokes, encompassest the Gods.
I yearn for bounty manifold. {#13:6}

* * *

## HYMN XIV. Agni.

ENKINDLING the Immortal, wake Agni with song of praise: may he bear our oblations to the Gods. {#14:1}

At high solemnities mortal men glorify him the Immortal, best
At sacrifice among mankind. {#14:2}

That he may bear their gifts to heaven, all glorify him Agni, God,
With ladle that distilleth oil. {#14:3}

Agni shone bright when born, with light killing the Dasyus and the dark:
He found the Kine, the Floods, the Sun. {#14:4}

Serve Agni, God adorable, the Sage whose back is balmed with oil:
Let him approach, and hear my call. {#14:5}

They have exalted Agni, God of all mankind, with oil and hymns
Of praise, devout and eloquent. {#14:6}

* * *

## HYMN XV. Agni.

To him, the far-renowned, the wise Ordainer, ancient and glorious, a song I offer.
Enthroned in oil, the Asura, bliss-giver, is Agni, firm support of noble, riches. {#15:1}

By holy Law they kept supporting Order, by help of sacrifice, in loftiest heaven,—
They who attained with born men to the unborn, men seated on that stay, heaven's firm sustainer. {#15:2}

Averting woe, they labour hard to bring him, the ancient, plenteous food as power resistless.
May he, born newly, conquer his assailants: round him they stand as round an angry lion. {#15:3}

When, like a mother, spreading forth to nourish, to cherish and regard each man that liveth,—
Consuming all the strength that thou hast gotten, thou wanderest round, thyself, in varied fashion. {#15:4}

May strength preserve the compass of thy vigour, God! that broad stream of thine that beareth riches.
Thou, like a thief who keeps his refuge secret, hast holpen Atri to great wealth, by teaching. {#15:5}

* * *

## HYMN XVI. Agni.

GREAT power is in the beam of light, sing praise to, Agni, to the God
Whom men have set in foremost place like Mitra with their eulogies. {#16:1}

He by the splendour of his arms is Priest of every able man.
Agni conveys oblation straight, and deals, as Bhaga deals, his boons. {#16:2}

All rests upon the laud and love of him the rich, high-flaming God,
On whom, loud-roaring, men have laid great strength as on a faithful friend. {#16:3}

So, Agni, be the Friend of these with liberal gift of hero strength.
Yea, Heaven and Earth have not surpassed this Youthful One in glorious fame. {#16:4}

O Agni, quickly come to us, and, glorified, bring precious wealth.
So we and these our princes will assemble for the good of all. Be near in fight to prosper us. {#16:5}

* * *

## HYMN XVII. Agni.

GOD, may a mortal call the Strong hither, with solemn rites, to aid,
A man call Agni to protect when sacrifice is well prepared. {#17:1}

Near him thou seemest mightier still in native glory, set to hold
Apart yon flame-hued vault of heaven, lovely beyond the thought of man. {#17:2}

Yea, this is by the light of him whom powerful song hath bound to act,
Whose beams of splendour flash on high as though they sprang from heavenly seed. {#17:3}

Wealth loads the Wonder-Worker's car through his, the very wise One's power.
Then, meet to be invoked among all tribes, is Agni glorified. {#17:4}

Now, too, the princes shall obtain excellent riches by our lips.
Protect us for our welfare: lend thy succour, O thou Son of Strength. Be near in fight to prosper us. {#17:5}

* * *

## HYMN XVIII. Agni.

AT dawn let Agni, much-beloved guest of the house, be glorified;
Immortal who delights in all oblations brought by mortal men. {#18:1}

For Dvita who receives through wealth of native strength maimed offerings,
Thy praiser even gains at once the Soma-drops, Immortal Gods! {#18:2}

Nobles, with song I call that car of yours that shines with lengthened life,
For, God who givest steeds! that car hither and thither goes unharmed. {#18:3}

They who have varied ways of thought, who guard the lauds within their lips,
And strew the grass before the light, have decked themselves with high renown. {#18:4}

Immortal Agni, give the chiefs, heroes who institute the rite,
Heroes’ illustrious, lofty fame, who at the synod met for praise presented me with fifty steeds. {#18:5}

* * *

## HYMN XIX. Agni.

ONE state begets another state: husk is made visible from husk:
Within his Mother's side he speaks. {#19:1}

Discerning, have they offered gifts: they guard the strength that never wastes.
To a strong fort have they pressed in. {#19:2}

Śvaitreya's people, all his men, have gloriously increased in might.
A gold chain Bṛhaduktha wears, as, through this Soma, seeking spoil. {#19:3}

I bring, as ’twere, the longed-for milk, the dear milk of the Sister-Pair.
Like to a caldron filled with food is he, unconquered, conquering all. {#19:4}

Beam of light, come to us in sportive fashion, finding thyself close to the wind that fans thee.
These flames of his are wasting flames, like arrows keen-pointed, sharpened, on his breast. {#19:5}

* * *

## HYMN XX. Agni.

AGNI, best winner of the spoil, cause us to praise before the Gods
As our associate meet for lauds, wealth which thou verily deemest wealth. {#20:1}

Agni, the great who ward not off the anger of thy power and might
Stir up the wrath and hatred due to one who holds an alien creed. {#20:2}

Thee, Agni, would we choose as Priest, the perfecter of strength and skill;
We who bring sacred food invoke with song thee Chief at holy rites. {#20:3}

Here as is needful for thine aid we toil, O Conqueror, day by day,
For wealth, for Law. May we rejoice, Most Wise One! at the feast, with kine, rejoice, with heroes, at the feast. {#20:4}

* * *

## HYMN XXI. Agni.

WE stablish thee as Manus used, as Manus used we kindle thee.
Like Manus, for the pious man , Aṅgiras, Agni, worship Gods. {#21:1}

For well, O Agni, art thou pleased when thou art kindled mid mankind.
Straight go the ladles unto thee, thou highborn God whose food is oil. {#21:2}

Thee have all Gods of one accord established as their messenger.
Serving at sacrifices men adore thee as a God, O Sage. {#21:3}

Let mortal man adore your God, Agni, with worship due to Gods.
Shine forth enkindled, Radiant One. Sit in the chamber of the Law, sit in the chamber of the food. {#21:4}

* * *

## HYMN XXII. Agni.

LIKE Atri, Viśvasāman! sing to him of purifying light,
Who must be praised in holy rites, the Priest most welcome in the house. {#22:1}

Set Jātavedas in his place, Agni the God and Minister.
Let sacrifice proceed to-day duly, comprising all the Gods. {#22:2}

All mortals come to thee for aid, the God of most observant mind.
Of thine excelling favour we bethink us as we long for it. {#22:3}

Mark with attention this our speech, O Agni, thou victorious One.
Thee, Strong-jawed! as the homestead's Lord, the Atris with their lauds exalt, the Atris beautify with songs. {#22:4}

* * *

## HYMN XXIII. Agni.

Protect Tryaruna, as thou art waxing strong and art highly praised, Vaiśvānara Agni!
Who granteth me a hundred kine and twenty, and two bay horses, good at draught, and harnessed. {#27:2}

So Trasadasyu served thee, God Most Youthful, craving thy favour for the ninth time, Agni;
Tryaruya who with attentive spirit accepteth many a song from me the mighty. {#27:3}

The gifts of Asvamedha, like thrice-mingled draughts of Soma juice. {#27:5}

## HYMN XXIX. Agni.

MAN'S worship of the Gods hath three great lustres, and three celestial lights have they established
The Maruts gifted with pure strength adore thee, for thou, O Indra, art their sapient Ṛṣi. {#29:1}

What time the Maruts sang their song to Indra, joyous when he had drunk of Soma juices,
He grasped his thunderbolt to slay the Dragon, and loosed, that they might flow, the youthful Waters. {#29:2}

And, O ye Brahmans, Maruts, so may Indra drink draughts of this my carefully pressed Soma;
For this oblation found for man the cattle, and Indra, having quaffed it, slew the Dragon. {#29:3}

Then heaven and earth he sundered and supported: wrapped even in these he struck the Beast with terror.
So Indra forced the Engulfer to disgorgement, and slew the Dānava. panting against him. {#29:4}

Thus all the Gods, O Maghavan, delivered to thee of their free will the draught of Soma;
When thou for Etaśa didst cause to tarry the flying mares of Sūrya racing forward. {#29:5}

When Maghavan with the thunderbolt demolished his nine-and-ninety castles all together,
The Maruts, where they met, glorified Indra: ye with the Tṛṣṭup hymn obstructed heaven. {#29:6}

As friend to aid a friend, Agni dressed quickly three hundred buffaloes, even as he willed it.
And Indra, from man's gift, for Vṛtra's slaughter, drank ofr at once three lakes of pressed-out Soma. {#29:7}

When thou three hundred buffaloes' flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as Maghavan, three lakes of Soma,
All the Gods raised as ’twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because he slew the Dragon. {#29:8}

What time ye came with strong steeds swiftly speeding, O Uśanā and Indra, to the dwelling,
Thou camest thither -conquering together with Kutsa and the Gods: thou slewest Śuṣṇa. {#29:9}

One car-wheel of the Sun thou rolledst forward, and one thou settest free to move for Kutsa.
Thou slewest noseless Dasyus with thy weapon, and in their home o’erthrewest hostile speakers. {#29:10}

The lauds of Gauriviti made thee mighty to Vidathin's son, as prey, thou gavest Pipru.
Rjisivan drew thee into friendship dressing the sacred food, and thou hast drunk his Soma. {#29:11}

Navagvas and Dasgvas with libations of Soma juice sing hymns of praise to Indra.
Labouring at their task the men laid open the stall of Kine though firmly closed and fastened. {#29:12}

How shall I serve thee, Maghavan, though knowing full well what hero deeds thou hast accomplished?
And the fresh deeds which thou wilt do, Most Mighty! these, too, will we tell forth in sacred synods. {#29:13}

Resistless from of old through hero courage, thou hast done all these many acts, O Indra.
What thou wilt do in bravery, Thunder-wielder! none is there who may hinder this thy prowess. {#29:14}

Indra, accept the prayers which now are offered, accept the new prayers, Mightiest! which we utter.
Like fair and well-made robes, I, seeking riches, as a deft craftsman makes a car, have wrought them. {#29:15}

* * *

## HYMN XXX. Indra.

WHERE is that Hero? Who hath looked on Indra borne on light-rolling car by Tawny Coursers,
Who, Thunderer, seeks with wealth the Soma-presser, and to his house goes, much-invoked, to aid him? {#30:1}

I have beheld his strong and secret dwelling, longing have sought the Founder's habitation.
I asked of others, and they said in answer, May we, awakened men, attain to Indra. {#30:2}

We will tell, Indra, when we pour libation, what mighty deeds thou hast performed to please us.
Let him who knows not learn, who knows them listen: hither rides Maghavan with all his army. {#30:3}

Indra, when born, thou madest firm thy spirit: alone thou seekest war to fight with many.
With might thou clavest e’en the rock asunder, and foundest out the stable of the Milch-kine. {#30:4}

When thou wast born supremest at a distance, bearing a name renowned in far-off regions,
Since then e’en Gods have been afraid of Indra: he conquered all the floods which served the Dāsa. {#30:5}

These blissful Maruts sing their psalm to praise thee, and pour to thee libation of the Soma.
Indra with wondrous powers subdued the Dragon, the guileful lurker who beset the waters. {#30:6}

Thou, Maghavan, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver.
There, seeking man's prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dāsa. {#30:7}

Pounding the head of Namuci the Dāsa, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra!
Yea, and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Maruts. {#30:8}

Women for weapons hath the Dāsa taken, What injury can his feeble armies To me?
Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu. {#30:9}

Divided from their calves the Cows went lowing around, on every side, hither and thither.
These Indra re-united with his helpers, what time the well-pressed Soma made him joyful. {#30:10}

What time the Somas mixed by Babhru cheered him, loud the Steer bellowed in his habitations.
So Indra drank thereof, the Fort-destroyer, and gave him guerdon, in return, of milch-kine. {#30:11}

This good deed have the Rusamas done, Agni! that they have granted me four thousand cattle.
We have received Rnancaya's wealth, of heroes the most heroic, which was freely offered. {#30:12}

The Rusamas, O Agni, sent me homeward with fair adornment and with kine in thousands.
The strong libations have made Indra joyful, when night, whose course was ending, changed to morning. {#30:13}

Night, well-nigh ended, at Rnancaya's coming, King of the Rusamas, was changed to morning.
Like a strong courser, fleet of foot, urged onward, Babhru hath gained four thousand as his guerdon. {#30:14}

We have received four thousand head of cattle presented by the Rusamas, O Agni.
And we, the singers, have received the caldron of metal which was heated for Pravargya. {#30:15}

* * *

## HYMN XXXI. Indra.

MAGHAVAN Indra turns his chariot downward, the strength-displaying car which he hath mounted.
Even as a herdsman driveth forth his cattle, he goeth, first, uninjured, fain for treasure. {#31:1}

Haste to us, Lord of Bays; be not ungracious: visit us, lover of gold-hued oblation.
There is naught else better than thou art, Indra: e’en to the wifeless hast thou given spouses. {#31:2}

When out of strength arose the strength that conquers, Indra displayed all powers that he possesses.
Forth from the cave he drove the milky mothers, and with the light laid bare investing darkness. {#31:3}

Anus have wrought a chariot for thy Courser, and Tvaṣṭar, Much-invoked! thy bolt that glitters.
The Brahmans with their songs exalting Indra increased his strength that he might slaughter Ahi. {#31:4}

When heroes sang their laud to thee the Hero, Indra! and stones and Aditi accordant,
Without or steed or chariot were the fellies which, sped by Indra, rolled upon the Dasytis. {#31:5}

I will declare thine exploits wrought aforetime, and, Maghavan, thy deeds of late achievement,
When, Lord of Might, thou sunderedst earth and heaven, winning for man the moistly-gleaming waters. {#31:6}

This is thy deed, e’en this, Wonderful! Singer! that, slaying Ahi, here thy strength thou showedst,
Didst check and stay e’en gusna's wiles and magic, and, drawing nigh, didst chase away the Dasytis. {#31:7}

Thou, Indra, on the farther bank forYadu and Turvaga didst stay the gushing waters.
Ye both assailed the fierce: thou barest Kutsa: when Gods and Uśanā came to you together. {#31:8}

Let the steeds bring you both, Indra and Kutsa, borne on the chariot within hearing-distance.
Ye blew him from the waters, from his dwelling, and chased the darkness from the noble's spirit. {#31:9}

Even this sage hath come looking for succour even to Vāta's docile harnessed horses.
Here are the Maruts, all, thy dear companions: prayers have increased thy power and might, O Indra. {#31:10}

When night was near its close he carried forward e’en the Sun's chariot backward in its running.
Etaga brought his wheel and firmly stays it: setting it eastward he shall give us courage. {#31:11}

This Indra, O ye men, hath come to see you, seeking a friend who hath expressed the Soma.
The creaking stone is laid upon the altar, and the Adhvaryus come to turn it quickly. {#31:12}

Let mortals who were happy still be happy; let them not come to sorrow, O Immortal.
Love thou the pious, and to these thy people-with whom may we be numbered-give thou vigour. {#31:13}

## HYMN XXXII. Indra.

THE well thou clavest, settest free the fountains, and gavest rest to floods that were obstructed.
Thou, Indra, laying the great mountain open, slaying the Dānava, didst loose the torrents. {#32:1}

The fountain-depths obstructed in their seasons, thou, Thunderer! madest flow, the mountain's udder.
Strong Indra, thou by slaying e’en the Dragon that lay extended there hast shown thy vigour. {#32:2}

Indra with violence smote down the weapon,
yea, even of that wild and mighty creature.
Although he deemed himself alone unequalled, another had been born e’en yet more potent. {#32:3}

Him, whom the heavenly food of these delighted, child of the mist, strong waxing, couched in darkness,
Him the bolt-hurling Thunderer with his lightning smote down and slew, the Dānava's wrath-fire, Śuṣṇa. {#32:4}

Though he might ne’er be wounded still his vitals felt that, the God's bolt, which his powers supported,
When, after offered draughts, Strong Lord, thou laidest him, fain to battle, in the pit in darkness. {#32:5}

Him as he lay there huge in length extended, still waxing in the gloom which no sun lightened,
Him, after loud-voiced threats, the Hero Indra, rejoicing in the poured libation, slaughtered. {#32:6}

When 'gainst the mighty Dānava his weapon Indra uplifted, power which none could combat,
When at the hurling of his bolt he smote him, he made him lower than all living creatures. {#32:7}

The fierce God seized that huge and restless coiler, insatiate, drinker of the sweets, recumbent,
And with his mighty weapon in his dwelling smote down the footless evil-speaking ogre. {#32:8}

Who may arrest his strength or cheek his vigour? Alone, resistless, he bears off all riches.
Even these Twain, these Goddesses, through terror of Indra's might, retire from his dominion. {#32:9}

E’en the Celestial Axe bows down before him, and the Earth, lover-like, gives way to Indra.
As he imparts all vigour to these people, straightway the folk bend them to him the Godlike. {#32:10}

I hear that thou wast born sole Lord of heroes of the Five Races, famed among the people.
As such my wishes have most lately grasped him, invoking Indra both at eve and morning. {#32:11}

So, too, I hear of thee as in due season urging to action and enriching singers.
What have thy friends received from thee, the Brahmans who, faithful, rest their hopes on thee, O Indra? {#32:12}

* * *

## HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

GREAT praise to Indra, great and strong mid heroes, I ponder thus, the feeble to the Mighty,
Who with his band shows favour to this people, when lauded, in the fight where spoil is gathered. {#33:1}

So made attentive by our hymns, Steer! Indra! thou fastenedst the girth of thy Bay Coursers,
Which, Maghavan, at thy will thou drivest hither. With these subdue for us the men who hate us. {#33:2}

They were not turned to us-wtrd, lofty Indra! while yet through lack of prayer they stood unharnessed.
Ascend this chariot, thou whose hand wields thunder, and draw the rein, O Lord of noble horses. {#33:3}

Thou, because many lauds are thine, O Indra, wast active warring in the fields
for cattle.
For Sūrya in his own abode thou, Hero, formedst in fights even a Dāsa's nature. {#33:4}

Thine are we, Indra; thine are all these people, conscious of might, whose cars are set in motion.
Some hero come to us, O Strong as Ahi beauteous in war, to be invoked like Bhaga. {#33:5}

Strength much to be desired is in thee, Indra: the Immortal dances forth his hero exploits.
Such, Lord of Treasure, give us splendid riches. I praise the Friend's gift, his whose wealth is mighty. {#33:6}

Thus favour us, O Indra, with ihy succour; Hero, protect the bards who sing thy praises.
Be friendly in the fray to those who offer the skin of beautiful and well-pressed Soma. {#33:7}

And these ten steeds which Trasadasyu gives me, the goldrich chief, the son of Purukutsa,
Resplendent in their brightness shall convey me. Gairiksita willed it and so came I hither. {#33:8}

And these, bestowed as sacrificial guerdon, the powerful tawny steeds of Marutasva;
And thousands which kind Cyavatana gave me, abundantly bestowed for my adornment. {#33:9}

And these commended horses, bright and active, by Dhvanya son of Laksmana presented,
Came unto me, as cows into the Ṛṣi Samvarana's stall, with magnitude of riches. {#33:10}

* * *

## HYMN XXXIV. Indra.

BOUNDLESS and wasting not, the heavenly food of Gods goes to the foeless One, doer of wondrous deeds.
Press out, make ready, offer gifts with special zeal to him whom many laud, accepter of the prayer. {#34:1}

He who filled full his belly with the Soma's juice, Maghavan, was delighted with the meath's sweet draught,
When Uśanā, that he might slay the monstrous beast, gave him the mighty weapon with a thousand points. {#34:2}

Illustrious is the man whoever presseth out Soma for him in sunshine or in cloud and rain.
The mighty Maghavan who is the sage's Friend advanceth more and more his beauteous progeny. {#34:3}

The Strong God doth not flee away from him whose sire, whose mother or whose brother he hath done to death.
He, the Avenger, seeketh this man's offered gifts: this God, the source of riches, doth not flee from sin. {#34:4}

He seeks no enterprise with five or ten to aid, nor stays with him who pours no juice though prospering well.
The Shaker conquers or slays in this way or that, and to the pious gives a stable full of kine. {#34:5}

Exceeding strong in war he stays the chariot wheel, and, hating him who pours not, prospers him who pours.
Indra the terrible, tamer of every man, as Ārya leads away the Dāsa at his will. {#34:6}

He gathers up for plunder all the niggard’s gear: excellent wealth he gives to him who offers gifts.
Not even in wide stronghold may all the folk stand firm who have provoked to anger his surpassing might. {#34:7}

When Indra Maghavan hath marked two wealthy men fighting for beauteous cows with all their followers,
He who stirs all things takes one as his close ally, and, Shaker, with his Heroes, sends the kine to him. {#34:8}

Agni! I laud the liberal Agnivesi, Satri the type and standard of the pious.
May the collected waters yield him plenty, and his be powerful and bright dominion. {#34:9}

* * *

## HYMN XXXV. Indra.

INDRA, for our assistance bring that most effectual power of thine,
Which conquers men for us, and wins the spoil, invincible in fight. {#35:1}

Indra, whatever aids be thine, four be they, or, O Hero, three,
Or those of the Five Tribes of men, bring quickly all that help to us. {#35:2}

The aid most excellent of thee the Mightiest hitherward we call,
For thou wast born with hero might, conquering, Indra, with the Strong. {#35:3}

Mighty to prosper us wast thou born, and mighty is the strength thou hast.
In native power thy soul is firm: thy valour, Indra, slays a host. {#35:4}

O Śatakratu, Lord of Strength, O Indra, Caster of the Stone.
With all thy chariot's force assail the man who shows himself thy foe. {#35:5}

For, Mightiest Vṛtra-slayer, thee, fierce, foremost among many, folk
Whose sacred grass is trimmed invite to battle where the spoil is won. {#35:6}

Indra, do thou protect our car that mingles foremost in the fights,
That bears its part in every fray, invincible and seeking spoil. {#35:7}

Come to us, Indra, and protect our car with thine intelligence.
May we, O Mightiest One, obtain excellent fame at break of day, and meditate our hymn at dawn. {#35:8}

* * *

## HYMN XXXVI. Indra.

MAY Indra come to us, he who knows rightly to give forth treasures from his store of riches.
Even as a thirsty steer who roams the deserts may he drink eagerly the milked-out Soma. {#36:1}

Lord of Bay Horses, Hero, may the Soma rise to thy cheeks and jaws like mountain-ridges.
May we, O King, as he who driveth coursers, all joy in thee with hymns, invoked of many! {#36:2}

Invoked of many, Caster of the Stone my heart quakes like a rolling wheel for fear of penury.
Shall not Puruvasu the singer give thee praise, O ever-prospering Maghavan, mounted on thy car? {#36:3}

Like the press-stone is this thy praiser, Indra. Loudly he lifts his voice with strong endeavour.
With thy left hand, O Maghavan, give us riches: with thy right, Lord of Bays, be not reluctant. {#36:4}

May the strong Heaven make thee the Strong wax stronger: Strong, thou art borne by thy two strong Bay Horses.
So, fair of cheek, with mighty chariot, mighty, uphold us, strong-willed, thunderarmed, in battle. {#36:5}

Maruts, let all the people in obeisance bow down before this youthful Srutaratha,
Who, rich in steeds, gave me two dark red horses together with three hundred head of cattle. {#36:6}

* * *

## HYMN XXXVII. Indra.

BEDEWED with holy oil and meetly worshipped, the Swift One vies with Sūrya's beam in splendour.
For him may mornings dawn without cessation who saith, Let us press Soma out for Indra. {#37:1}

With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser, sing with stones adjusted:
And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with his oblation to the river. {#37:2}

This wife is coming near who loves her husband who carries to his home a vigorous consort.
Here may his car seek fame, here loudly thunder, and his wheel make a thousand revolutions. {#37:3}

No troubles vex that King in whose home Indra drinks the sharp Soma juice with milk commingled.
With heroes he drives near, he slays the foeman: Blest, cherishing that name, he guards his people. {#37:4}

May he support in peace and win in battle: he masters both the hosts that meet together.
Dear shall he be to Sūrya, dear to Agni, who with pressed Soma offers gifts to India. {#37:5}

## HYMN XXXVIII. Indra.

WIDE, Indra Śatakratu, spreads the bounty of thine ample grace:
So, Lord of fair dominion, Friend of all men, give us splendid wealth. {#38:1}

The food which, Mightiest Indra, thou possessest worthy of renown
Is bruited as most widely famed, invincible, O Golden-hued! {#38:2}

O Darter of the Stone, the powers which readily obey thy will,—
Divinities, both thou and they, ye rule, to guard them, earth and heaven. {#38:3}

And from whatever power of thine, O Vṛtra-slayer, it may be,
Bring thou to us heroic strength: thou hast a man's regard for us. {#38:4}

In thy protection, with these aids of thine, O Lord of Hundred Powers,
Indra, may we be guarded well, Hero, may we be guarded well. {#38:5}

* * *

## HYMN XXXIX. Indra.

STONE-DARTING Indra. Wondrous One, what wealth is richly given from thee,
That bounty, Treasure-Finder! bring filling both thy hands, to us. {#39:1}

Bring what thou deemest worth the wish, O Indra, that which is in heaven.
So may we know thee as thou art, boundless in thy munificence. {#39:2}

Thy lofty spirit, far-renowned as fain to give and prompt to win,—
With this thou rendest e’en the firm, Stone-Darter! so to gain thee strength. {#39:3}

Singers with many songs have made Indra propitious to their fame,
Him who is King of human kind, most liberal of your wealthy ones. {#39:4}

To him, to Indra must be sung the poet's word, the hymn of praise.
To him, accepter of the prayer, the Atris raise their songs on high, the Atris beautify their songs. {#39:5}

## HYMN XL. Indra. Sūrya. Atri.

COME thou to what the stones have pressed, drink Soma, O thou Soma's Lord,
Indra best Vṛtra-slayer Strong One, with the Strong. {#40:1}

Strong is the stone, the draught is strong, strong is this Soma that is pressed,
Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong. {#40:2}

As strong I call on thee the Strong, O Thunder-armed, with various aids,
Indra, best Vṛtra-slayer, Strong One with the Strong. {#40:3}

Impetuous, Thunderer, Strong, quelling the mighty, King, potent, Vṛtra-slayer, Soma-drinker,
May he come hither with his yoked Bay Horses; may Indra gladden him at the noon libation. {#40:4}

O Sūrya, when the Asura's descendant Svarbhanu, pierced thee through and through with darkness,
All creatures looked like one who is bewildered, who knoweth not the place where he is standing. {#40:5}

What time thou smotest down Svarbhanu's magic that spread itself beneath the sky, O Indra,
By his fourth sacred prayer Atri disoovered Sūrya concealed in gloom that stayed his function. {#40:6}

Let not the oppressor with this dread, through anger swallow me up, for I am thine, O Atri.
Mitra art thou, the sender of true blessings: thou and King Varuṇa be both my helpers. {#40:7}

The Brahman Atri, as he set the press-stones, serving the Gods with praise and adoration,
Established in the heaven the eye of Sūrya, and caused Svarbhanu's magic arts to vanish. {#40:8}

The Atris found the Sun again, him whom Svarbhanu of the brood
Of Asuras had pierced with gloom. This none besides had power to do. {#40:9}

Or also to the Asura of heaven, Worshipful, bring a hymn as ’twere libation. {#41:3}

The heavenly Victor, he whose priest is Kaṇva, Tṛta with Dyaus accordant, Vāta, Agni,
All-feeding Pūṣan, Bhaga sought the oblation, as they whose steeds are fleetest seek the contest. {#41:4}

Bring ye your riches forward borne on horses: let thought be framed for help and gain of treasure.
Blest he the priest of Auśija through courses, the courses which are yours the fleet, O Maruts. {#41:5}

Bring hither him who yokes the car, your Vāyu, who praises with his songs, the God and Singer;
And, praying and devout, noble and prudent, may the Gods’ Spouses in their thoughts retain us. {#41:6}

I speed to you with powers that should be honoured, with songs distinguishing Heaven's mighty Daughters,
Morning and Night, the Two, as ’twere all-knowing: these bring the sacrifice unto the mortal. {#41:7}

You I extol, the nourishers of heroes bringing you gifts, Vastospati and Tvaṣṭar-
Rich Dhiṣaṇā accords through our obeisance - andTrees and Plants, for the swift gain of riches. {#41:8}

Ours be the Parvatas, even they, for offspring, free-moving, who are Heroes like the Vasus.
May holy Āptya, Friend of man, exalted, strengthen our word for ever and be near us. {#41:9}

Tṛta praised him, germ of the earthly hero, with pure songs him the Offspring of the Waters.
Agn; with might neighs loudly like a charger: he of the flaming hair destroys the forests. {#41:10}

How shall we speak to the great might of Rudra? How speak to Bhaga who takes thought for riches?
May Plants, the Waters, and the Sky preserve us, and Woods and Mountains with their trees for tresses. {#41:11}

May the swift Wanderer, Lord of refreshments listen to our songs, who speeds throuih cloudy heaven:
And may the Waters, bright like castles, hear us, as they flow onward from the cloven mountain. {#41:12}

We know your ways, ye Mighty Ones receiving choice meed, ye Wonderful, we will proclaim it.
Even strong birds descend not to the mortal who strives to reach them with swift blow and weapons. {#41:13}

Celestial and terrestrial generations, and Waters will I summon to the feasting.
May days with bright dawns cause my songs to prosper, and may the conquered streams increase their waters. {#41:14}

Duly to each one hath my laud been offered. Strong be Varūtrī with her powers to succour.
May the great Mother Rasā here befriend us, straight-handed, with the princes, striving forward. {#41:15}

How may we serve the Liberal Ones with worship, the Maruts swift of course in invocation, the Maruts far-renowned in invocation?
Let not the Dragon of the Deep annoy us, and gladly may he welcome our addresses. {#41:16}

Thus thinking, O ye Gods, the mortal wins you to give him increase of his herds of cattle: the mortal wins him, O ye Gods, your favour.
Here he wins wholesome food to feed this body: as for mine old age, Nirrti consume it {#41:17}

O Gods, may we obtain from you this favour, strengthening food through the Cow's praise, ye Vasus.
May she who gives good gifts, the gracious Goddes. s, come speeding nigh to us for our well-being. {#41:18}

May Iḷā, Mother of the herds of cattle, and Urvasi with all the streams accept us;
May Urvasi in lofty heaven accepting, as she partakes the oblation of the living, {#41:19}

Visit us while she shares Urjavya's food. {#41:20}

Now may our sweetest song with deep devotion reach Varuṇa, Mitra, Aditi, and Bhaga.
May the Five Priests' Lord, dwelling in oblations, bliss-giving Asura, hear, whose paths are open. {#42:1}

May Aditi welcome, even as a mother her dear heart-gladdening son, my song that lauds her.
The prayer they love, bliss-giving, God-appointed, I offer unto Varuṇa and Mitra. {#42:2}

In spirit him, the Sagest of the Sages; with sacrificial oil and meath bedew him
So then let him, God Savitar, provide us excellent, ready, and resplendent treasures. {#42:3}

With willing mind, Indra, vouchsafe us cattle, prosperity, Lord of Bays! and pious patrons;
And, with the sacred prayer by Gods appointed, give us the holy Deities' lovingkindness. {#42:4}

God Bhaga, Savitar who deals forth riches, Indra, and they who conquer Vṛtra's treasures,
And Vāja and Ṛbhukṣan and Purandhi, the Mighty and Immortal Ones, protect us! {#42:5}

Let us declare his deeds, the undecaying unrivalled Victor whom the Maruts follow.
None of old times, O Maghavan, nor later, none of these days hath reached thy hero prowess. {#42:6}

Praise him the Chief who gives the boon of riches, Bṛhaspati distributor of treasures,
Who, blessing most the man who sings and praises, comes with abundant wealth to his invoker. {#42:7}

Tended, Bṛhaspati, with thy protections, the princes are unharmed and girt by heroes.
Wealth that brings bliss is found among the givers of horses and of cattle and of raiment. {#42:8}

Make their wealth flee who, through our hymns enjoying their riches, yield us not an ample guerdon.
Far from the sun keep those who hate devotion, the godless, prospering in their vocation. {#42:9}

With wheelless chariots drive down him, O Maruts, who at the feasts of Gods regards the demons.
May he, though bathed in sweat, form empty wishes, who blames his sacred rite who toils to serve you. {#42:10}

Praise him whose bow is strong and sure his arrow, him who is Lord of every balm that bealeth.
Worship thou Rudra for his great good favour: adore the Asura, God, with salutations. {#42:11}

May the House-friends, the cunning-handed Artists, may the Steer's Wives, the streams carved out by Vibhvan,
And may the fair Ones honour and befriend us, Sarasvatī, Brhaddiva, and Rākā. {#42:12}

My newest song, thought that now springs within me, I offer to the Great, the Sure Protector,
Who made for us this All, in fond love laying each varied form within his Daughter's bosom. {#42:13}

Now, even now, may thy fair praise, O Singer, attain Idaspati who roars and thunders,
Who, rich in clouds and waters with his lightning speeds forth bedewing both the earth and heaven. {#42:14}

May this my laud attain the troop of Maruts, those who are youths in act, the Sons of Rudra.
The wish calls me to riches and well-being: praise the unwearied Ones whose steeds are dappled. {#42:15}

May this my laud reach earth and air's mid-region, and forest trees and plants to win me riches.
May every Deity be swift to listen, and Mother Earth with no ill thought regard me. {#42:16}

Gods, may we dwell in free untroubled bliss. {#42:17}

May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.

MAY the Milch-cows who hasten to their object come harmless unto us with liquid sweetness.
The Singer, lauding, calls, for ample riches, the Seven Mighty Ones who bring enjoyment. {#43:1}

With reverence and fair praise will I bring hither, for sake of strength, exhaustless Earth and Heaven.
Father and Mother, sweetof speech, fairhanded, may they, far-famed, in every fight protect us. {#43:2}

Adhvaryus, make the sweet libations ready, and bring the beautiful bright juice to Vāyu.
God, as our Priest, be thou the first to drink it: we give thee of the mead to make thee joyful. {#43:3}

Two arms-the Soma's dexterous immo. lators-and the ten fingers set and fix the press-stone.
The stalk hath poured, fair with its spreading branches, the mead's bright glittering juice that dwells on mountains. {#43:4}

The Soma hath been pressed for thee, its lover, to give thee power and might and high enjoyment.
Invoked, turn hither in thy car, O Indra, at need, thy two well-trained and dear Bay Horses. {#43:5}

Bring by God-traversed paths, accordant, Agni, the great Aramati, Celestial Lady,
Exalted, worshipped with our gifts and homage, who knoweth holy Law, to drink sweet Soma. {#43:6}

As on his father's lap the son, the darling, so on the fire is set the sacred caldron,
Which holy singers deck, as if extending and heating that which holds the fatty membrane. {#43:7}

Hither, as herald to invite the Aśvins, come the great lofty song, most sweet and pleasant!
Come in one car, joy-givers! to the banquet, like the bolt binding pole and nave, come hither. {#43:8}

I have declared this speech of adoration to mightiest Pūṣan and victorious Vāyu,
Who by their bounty are the hymns' inspirers, and of themselves give power as a possession. {#43:9}

Invoked by us bring hither, jatavedas the Maruts all under their names and figures.
Come to the sacrifice with aid all Maruts, all to the songs and praises of the singer! {#43:10}

From high heaven may Sarasvatī the Holy visit our sacrifice, and from the mountain.
Eager, propitious, may the balmy Goddess hear our effectual speech, our invocation. {#43:11}

Set in his seat the God whose back is dusky, Bṛhaspati the lofty, the Disposer.
Him let us worship, set within the dwelling, the red, the golden-hued, the allresplendent. {#43:12}

May the Sustainer, high in heaven, come hither, the Bounteous One, invoked, with all his favours,
Dweller with Dames divine, with plants, unwearied, the Steer with triple horn, the life-bestower. {#43:13}

The tuneful eloquent priests of him who liveth have sought the Mother's bright and loftiest station.
As living men, with offered gifts and homage they deck the most auspicious Child to clothe him. {#43:14}

Agni, great vital power is thine, the mighty: pairs waxing old in their devotion seek thee.
May every Deity be swift to listen, and Mother Earth with no ill thought regard me. {#43:15}

Gods, may we dwell in free untroubled bliss. {#43:16}

May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their health-bestowing happy guidance.

## HYMN XLIV. Viśvedevas.

As in the first old times, as all were wont, as now, he draweth forth the power turned hitherward with song,
The Princedom throned on holy grass, who findeth light, swift, conquering in the' plants wherein he waxeth strong. {#44:1}

Shining to him who leaves heaven's regions undisturbed, which to his sheen who is beneath show fair in light,
Good guardian art thou, not to be deceived, Most Wise! Far from deceits thy name dwelleth in holy Law. {#44:2}

Truth waits upon oblation present and to come: naught checks him in his way, this vic tory- bringing Priest:
The Mighty Child who glides along the sacred grass, the undecaying Youth set in the midst of plants. {#44:3}

These come, well-yoked, to you for furtherance in the rite: down come the twinborn strengtheners of Law for him,
With reins easily guided and commanding all. In the deep fall the hide stealeth away their names. {#44:4}

Thou, moving beauteously in visibly pregnant ones, snatching with trees the branching plant that grasps the juice,
Shinest, true Singer! mid the upholders of the voice. Increase thy Consorts thou, lively at sacrifice. {#44:5}

Like as he is beheld such is he said to be.
They with effectual splendour in the floods have made
Earth yield us room enough and amply wide extent, great might invincible, with store of hero sons. {#44:6}

Sūrya the Sage, as if unwedded, with a Spouse, in battle-loving spirit moveth o’er the foes.
May he, self-excellent, grant us a sheltering home, a house that wards the fierce heat off on every side. {#44:7}

Thy name, sung forth by Ṛṣis in these hymns of ours, goes to the loftier One with this swift mover's light.
By skill he wins the boon whereon his heart is set: he who bestirs himself shall bring the thing to pass. {#44:8}

The chief and best of these abideth in the sea, nor doth libation fail wherein it is prolonged.
The heart of him who praiseth trembleth not in fear there where the hymn is found connected with the pure. {#44:9}

For it is he: with though to of Ksatra, Manasa, of Yajata, and Sadhri, and Evavada,
With Avatsara's sweet songs will we strive to win the mightiest strength which even he who knows should gain. {#44:10}

The Hawk is their full source, girth-stretching rapturous drink of Visvavara, of Mayin, and Yajata.
They ever seek a fresh draught so that they may come, know when thy time to halt and drink thy fill is near. {#44:11}

Sadaprna the holy, Tarya, Srutavit, and Bahuvrkta, joined with you, have slain the foes.
He gains his wish in both the worlds and brightly shines-when he adores the host with well-advancing steeds. {#44:12}

The worshipper's defender is Sutambhara, producer and uplifter of all holy thoughts.
The milch-cow brought, sweet-flavoured milk was dealt around. Who speaks the bidding text knows this, not he who sleeps. {#44:13}

The sacred hymns love him who wakes and watches: to him who watches come the Sāma verses.
This Soma saith unto the man who watches, I rest and have my dwelling in thy friendship. {#44:11}

Agni is watchful, and the gcas love him; Agni is watchful, Sāma verses seek him.
Agni is watchful, to him saith this Soma, I rest and have my dwelling in thy friendship. {#44:15}

## HYMN XLV. Viśvedevas.

BARDS of approaching Dawn who know the heavens are come with hymns to throw the mountain open.
The Sun hath risen and oped the stable portals: the doors of men, too, hath the God thrown open. {#45:1}

Sūrya hath spread his light as splendour: hither came the Cows' Mother, conscious, from the stable,
To streams that flow with biting waves to deserts; and heaven is stablished like a firm-set pillar. {#45:2}

This laud hath won the burden of the mountain. To aid the ancient birth of mighty waters
The mountain parted, Heaven performed his office. The worshippers were worn with constant serving. {#45:3}

With hymns and God-loved words will I invoke you, Indra and Agni, to obtain your favour,
For verily sages, skilled in sacrificing, worship the Maruts and with lauds invite them. {#45:4}

This day approach us: may our thoughts be holy, far from us let us cast away misfortune.
Let us keep those who hate us at a distance, and haste to meet the man who sacrifices. {#45:5}

Come, let us carry out, O friends, the purpose wherewith the Mother threw the Cow's stall open,
That wherewith Manu conquered Visisipra, wherewith the wandering merchant gained heaven's water. {#45:6}

Here, urged by hands, loudly hath rung the press-stone wherewith Navagvas through ten months sang praises.
Saramā went aright and found the cattle. Aṅgiras gave effect to all their labours. {#45:7}

When at the dawning of this mighty Goddess, Aṅgirases all sang forth with the cattle,—
Their spring is in the loftiest place of meeting,—Saramā found the kine by Order's pathway. {#45:8}

Borne by his Coursers Seven may Sūrya visit the field that spreadeth wide for his long journey.
Down on the Soma swooped the rapid Falcon. Bright was the young Sage moving mid his cattle. {#45:9}

Sūrya hath mounted to the shining ocean when he hath yoked his fair-backed Tawny Horses.
The wise have drawn him like a ship through water: the floods obedient have descended hither. {#45:10}

I lay upon the Floods your hymn, lightwinning, wherewith Navagvas their ten months completed.
Through this our hymn may we have Gods to guard us: through this our hymn pass safe beyond affliction. {#45:11}

## HYMN XLVI. Viśvedevas.

WELL knowing I have bound me, horselike, to the pole: I carry that which bears as on and gives us help.
I seek for no release, no turning back therefrom. May he who knows the way, the Leader, guide me straight. {#46:1}

O Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, and Mitra, give, O ye Gods, and Marut host, and Viṣṇu.
May both Nāsatyas, Rudra, heavenly Matrons, Pūṣan, Sarasvatī, Bhaga, accept us. {#46:2}

Indra and Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Aditi, the Waters, Mountains, Maruts, Sky, and Earth and Heaven,
Viṣṇu I call, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, and Bhaga, Samsa, Savitar that they may help. {#46:3}

May Viṣṇu also and Vāta who injures none, and Soma granter of possessions give us joy;
And may the Ṛbhus and the Aśvins, Tvaṣṭar and Vibhvan remember us so that we may have wealth. {#46:4}

So may the band of Maruts dwelling in the sky, the holy, come to us to sit on sacred grass;
Bṛhaspati and Pūṣan grant us sure defence, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman guard and shelter us. {#46:5}

And may the Mountains famed in noble eulogies, and the fair-gleaming Rivers keep us safe from harm.
May Bhaga the Dispenser come with power and grace, and far-pervading Aditi listen to my call. {#46:6}

May the Gods’ Spouses aid us of their own freewill, aid us to offspring and the winning of the spoil.
Grant us protection, O ye gracious Goddesses, ye who are on the earth or in the waters' realm. {#46:7}

May the Dames, wives of Gods, enjoy our presents, Rat, Aśvini, Agnāyī, and Indrāṇī.
May Rodasī and Varuṇānī hear us, and Goddesses come at the Matrons' season. {#46:8}

## HYMN XLVII. Viśvedevas.

URGING to toil and making proclamation, seeking Heaven's Daughter comes the Mighty Mother:
She comes, the youthful Hymn, unto the Fathers, inviting to her home and loudly calling. {#47:1}

Swift in their motion, hasting to their duty, reaching the central point of life immortal,
On every side about the earth and heaven go forth the spacious paths without a limit. {#47:2}

Steer, Sea, Red Bird with strong wings, he hath entered the dwelling-place of the Primeval Father.
A gay-hued Stone set in the midst of heaven, he hath gone forth and guards mid-air's two limits. {#47:3}

Four bear him up and give him rest and quiet, and ten invigorate the Babe for travel.
His kine most excellent, of threefold nature, pass swiftly round the boundaries of heaven. {#47:4}

Wondrous, O people, is the mystic knowledge that while the waters stand the streams are flowing:
That, separate from his Mother, Two support him, closely-united, twins, here made apparent. {#47:5}

For him they lenghten prayers and acts of worship: the Mothers weave garments for him their offspring.
Rejoicing, for the Steer's impregning contact, his Spouses move on paths or heaven to meet him. {#47:6}

Be this our praise, O Varuṇa and Mitra may this be health and force to us, O Agni.
May we obtain firm ground and room for resting: Glory to Heaven, the lofty habitation! {#47:7}

* * *

## HYMN XLVIII. Viśvedevas.

WHAT may we meditate for the beloved Power, mighty in native strength and glorious in itself,
Which as a magic energy seeking waters spreads even to theimmeasurable middle region's cloud? {#48:1}

O'er all the region with their uniform advance these have spread out the lore that giveth heroes strength.
Back, with their course reversed, the others pass away: the pious lengthens life with those that are before. {#48:2}

With pressing-stones and with the bright beams of the day he hurls his broadest bolt against the Guileful One.
Even he whose hundred wander in his own abode, driving the days afar and bringing them again. {#48:3}

I, to enjoy the beauty of his form, behold that rapid rush of his as ’twere an axe's edge,
What time he gives the man who calls on him in fight wealth like a dwelling-house filled full with store of food. {#48:4}

Four-faced and nobly clad, Varuṇa, urging on the pious to his task, stirs himself with the tongue.
Naught by our human nature do we know of him, him from whom Bhaga Savitar bestows the boon. {#48:5}

## HYMN XLIX. Viśvedevas.

THIS day I bring God Savitar to meet you, and Bhaga who allots the wealth of mortals.

Knowing full well the Asura's time of coming, worship God Savitar with hymns and praises.
Let him who rightly knoweth speak with homage to him who dealeth out man's noblest treasure. {#49:2}

Not for reward doth Pūṣan send his blessings, Bhaga, or Aditi: his garb is splendour.
May Indra, Visniu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni produce auspicious days, the Wonder-Workers. {#49:3}

Sending the shelter which we ask, the foeless Savitar and the Rivers shall approach us.
When I, the sacrifice's priest, invite them, may we he lords of wealth and rich possessions. {#49:4}

They who devote such worship to the Vasus, singing their hymns to Varuṇa and Mitra,
Vouchsafe them ample room, far off be danger. Through grace of Heaven and Earth may we be happy. {#49:5}

## HYMN L. Viśvedevas.

LET every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding God.
Each one solicits him for wealth and seeks renown to prosper him. {#50:1}

These, leading God, are thine, and these here ready to speak after us.
As such may we attain to wealth and wait with services on thee. {#50:2}

So further honour as our guests the Hero Gods and then the Dames.
May he remove and keep afar our foes and all who block our path. {#50:3}

Where fire is set, and swiftly runs the victim dwelling in the trough,
He wins, with heroes in his home, friendly to man, like constant streams. {#50:4}

May these thy riches, Leader God! that rule the car, be blest to us,
Yea, blest to us for wealth and weal. This will we ponder praising strength, this ponder as we praise the God. {#50:5}

To Indra and to Vāyu dear, this Soma, by the mortar pressed,
Is now poured forth to fill the jar. {#51:4}

Vāyu, come hither to the feast, wellpleased unto our sacred gifts:
Drink of the Soma juice effused come to the food. {#51:5}

Ye, Indra, Vāyu, well deserve to drink the juices pressed by us.
Gladly accept them, spotless Pair come to the food. {#51:6}

For Indra and for Vāyu pressed are Soma juices blent with curd,
As rivers to the lowland flow: come to the food. {#51:7}

Associate with all the Gods, come, with the Aśvins and with Dawn,
Agni, as erst with Atri, so enjoy the juice. {#51:8}

Associate with Varuṇa, with Mitra, Soma, Viṣṇu, come,

For weal Bṛhaspati with all his company. May the Ādityas bring us health and happiness. {#51:12}

## HYMN LII Maruts.

SING boldly forth, Śyāvāśva, with the Maruts who are loud in song,
Who, holy, as their wont is, joy in glory that is free from guile. {#52:1}

For in their boldness they are friends of firm and sure heroic strength.
They in their course, bold-spirited, guard all men of their own accord. {#52:2}

Like steers in rapid motion they advance and overtake the nights;
And thus the Maruts’ power in heaven and on the earth we celebrate. {#52:3}

With boldness to your Maruts let us offer laud and sacrifice:
Who all, through ages of mankind, guard mortal man from injury. {#52:4}

Praiseworthy, givers of good gifts, Heroes with full and perfect strength -
To Maruts, Holy Ones of heaven, will I extol the sacrifice. {#52:5}

The lofty Heroes cast their spears and weapons bright with gleaming gold.
After these Maruts followed close, like laughing lightning from the sky, a splendour of its own accord. {#52:6}

They who waxed mighty, of the earth, they who are in the wide mid-air,
Or in the rivers’ compass, or in the abode of ample heaven. {#52:7}

Praise thou the Maruts’ company, the valorous and truly strong,
The Heroes, hasting, by themselves have yoked their deer for victory. {#52:8}

Fair-gleaming, on Paruṣṇī they have clothed themselves in robes of wool,
And with their chariot tires they cleave the rock asunder in their might. {#52:9}

Whether as wanderers from the way or speeders on or to the path,
Under these names the spreading band tend well the sacrifice for me. {#52:10}

To this the Heroes well attend, well do their teams attend to this.
Visible are their varied forms. Behold, they are Paravatas. {#52:11}

Hymn-singing, seeking water, they, praising, have danced about the spring.
What are they unto me? No thieves, but helpers, splendid to behold. {#52:12}

Sublime, with lightnings for their spears, Sages and Orderers are they.
Ṛṣi, adore that Marut host, and make them happy with thy song. {#52:13}

Ṛṣi, invite the Marut band with offerings, as a maid her friend.
From heaven, too, Bold Ones, in your might haste hither glorified with songs. {#52:14}

Thinking of these now let him come, as with the escort of the Gods,
And with the splendid Princes, famed for rapid courses, to the gifts. {#52:15}

Princes, who, when I asked their kin, named Pṛśni as their Mother-cow,
And the impetuous Rudra they, the Mighty Ones, declared their Sire. {#52:16}

The mighty ones, the seven times seven, have singly given me hundred gifts.
I have obtained on Yamuna famed wealth in kine and wealth in steeds. {#52:17}

## HYMN LIII. Maruts.

Who knows the birth of these, or who lived in the Maruts’ favour in the days of old
What time their spotted deer were yoked? {#53:1}

Who, when they stood upon their cars, hath heard them tell the way they went?
Who was the bounteous man to whom their kindred rains flowed down with food of sacrifice? {#53:2}

To me they told it, and they came with winged steeds radiant to the draught,
Youths, Heroes free from spot or stain: Behold us here and praise thou us; {#53:3}

Who shine self-luminous with ornaments and swords, with breastplates, armlets, and with wreaths,
Arrayed on chariots and with bows. {#53:4}

O swift to pour your bounties down, ye Maruts, with delight I look upon your cars,
Like splendours coming through the rain. {#53:5}

Munificent Heroes, they have cast heaven's treasury down for the worshipper's behoof:
They set the storm-cloud free to stream through both the worlds, and rainfloods flow o’er desert spots. {#53:6}

The bursting streams m billowy flood have spread abroad, like milch-kine, o’er the firmament.
Like swift steeds hasting to their journey's resting-place, to every side run glittering brooks. {#53:7}

Hither, O Maruts, come from heaven, from mid-air, or from near at hand
Tarry not far away from us. {#53:8}

So let not Rasā, Krumu, or Anitabha, Kubha, or Sindhu hold you back.
Let not the watery Sarayti obstruct your way. With us be all the bliss ye give. {#53:9}

That brilliant gathering of your cars, the company of Maruts, of the Youthful Ones,
The rain-showers, speeding on, attend. {#53:10}

With eulogies and hymns may we follow your army, troop by troop, and band by band,
And company by company. {#53:11}

To what oblation-giver, sprung of noble ancestry, have sped
The Maruts on this course to-day? {#53:12}

Vouchsafe to us the bounty, that which we implore, through which, for child and progeny,
Ye give the seed of corn that wasteth not away, and bliss that reacheth to all life. {#53:13}

May we in safety pass by those who slander us, leaving behind disgrace and hate.
Maruts, may we be there when ye, at dawn, in rest and toil, rain waters down and balm. {#53:14}

Favoured by Gods shall he the man, O Heroes, Marutr! and possessed of noble sons,
Whom ye protect. Such may we be. {#53:15}

Praise the Free-givers. At this liberal patron's rite they joy like cattle in the mead.
So call thou unto them who come as ancient Friends: hymn those who love thee with a song. {#53:16}

## HYMN LIV. Maruts.

THIS hymn will I make for the Marut host who bright in native splendour cast the mountains down.
Sing the great strength of those illustrious in renown, who stay the heat, who sacrifice on heights of heaven. {#54:1}

O Maruts, rich in water, strengtheners of life are your strong bands with harnessed steeds, that wander far.
Trita roars out at him who aims the lightning-flash. The waters sweeping round are thundering on their way. {#54:2}

They gleam with lightning, Heroes, Casters of the Stone, wind-rapid Maruts, overthrowers of the bills,
Oft through desire to rain coming with storm of hail, roaring in onset, violent and exceeding strong. {#54:3}

When, mighty Rudras, through the nights and through the days, when through the sky and realms of air, shakers of all,
When over the broad fields ye drive along like ships, e’en to strongholds ye come, Maruts, but are not harmed. {#54:4}

Maruts, this hero strength and majesty of yours hath, like the Sun, extended o’er a lengthened way,
When in your course like deer with splendour unsubdued ye bowed the hill that gives imperishable rain. {#54:5}

Bright shone your host, ye Sages, Maruts, when ye smote the waving tree as when the worm consumeth it.
Accordant, as the eye guides him who walks, have ye led our devotion onward by an easy path. {#54:6}

Never is he, O Maruts, slain or overcome, never doth he decay ne’er is distressed or harmed;
His treasures, his resources, never waste away, whom. whether he be prince or Ṛṣi, ye direct. {#54:7}

With harnessed team like heroes overcoming troops, the friendly Maruts, laden with their water-casks,
Let the spring flow, and when impetuous' they roar they inundate the earth with floods of pleasant meath. {#54:8}

Free for the Maruts is the earth with sloping ways, free for the rushing Ones is heaven with steep descents.
The paths of air's mid-region are precipitous, precipitous the mountains with their running streams. {#54:9}

When, as the Sun hath risen up, ye take delight, O bounteous radiant Maruts, Heroes of the sky,
Your coursers weary not when speeding onṭheir way, and rapidly ye reach the end of this your path. {#54:10}

Lances are on your shoulders, anklets on your feet, gold chains are on your breasts, gems, Maruts, on your car.
Lightnings aglow with flame are flashing in your hands, and visors wroughtof gold are laid upon your heads. {#54:11}

Maruts, in eager stir ye shake the vault of heaven, splendid beyond conception, for its shining fruit.
They gathered when they let their deeds of might flash forth. The Pious Ones send forth a far-resounding shout. {#54:12}

Sage Maruts, may we be the drivers of the car of riches ful I of life that have been given by you.
O Maruts, let that wealth in thousands dwell with us which never vanishes like Tisya from the sky. {#54:13}

Maruts, ye further wealth with longedfor heroes, further the Ṛṣi skilled in chanted verses.
Ye give the Bhārata as his strength, a charger, and ye bestow a king who quickly listens. {#54:14}

Of you, most swift to succour! I solicit wealth wherewith we may spread forth mid men like as the Sun.
Accept, O Maruts, graciously this hymn of mine that we may live a hundred winters through its power. {#54:15}

When, armed with lances, ye are sporting, Maruts, and rush along together like the waters. {#60:3}

O HEROES lordliest of all, who are ye that have singly come
Forth from a region most remote? {#61:1}

Rein was on nose and seat on back. {#61:2}

The whip is laid upon the flank. The heroes stretch their thighs apart,
Like women when the babe is born. {#61:3}

Go ye, O Heroes, far away, ye bridegrooms with a lovely Spouse
That ye may warm you at the fire. {#61:4}

May she gain cattle for her meed, hundreds of sheep and steeds and kine,
Who threw embracing arms around the hero whom gyavaiva praised. {#61:5}

Yea, many a woman is more firm and better than the man who turns
Away from Gods, andoffers not. {#61:6}

She who discerns the weak and worn, the man who thirsts and is in want
She sets her mind upon the Gods. {#61:7}

And yet full many a one, unpraised, mean niggard, is entitled man:
Only in weregild is he such. {#61:8}

A hundred cows in liberal gift. {#61:10}

Moving to victory, checked by none. {#61:13}

Who knoweth, verily, of these where the All-shakers take delight,
Born, spotless, after sacred Law? {#61:14}

Guides are ye, lovers of the song to mortal man through holy hymn,
And hearers when he cries for help. {#61:15}

Do ye, destroyers of the foe, worshipful and exceeding bright,
Send down the treasures that we crave. {#61:16}

OUrmya, bear thou far away to Darbhya this my hymn of praise,
Songs, Goddess, as if chariot-borne. {#61:17}

From me to Rathaviti say, when he hath pressed the Soma juice,
The wish I had departeth not. {#61:18}

This wealthy Rathaviti dwells among the people rich in kine,
Among the mountains, far withdrawn. {#61:19}
