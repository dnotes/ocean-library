So flow thou onward through the fleece, for Indra flow, to be his drink,
Finding thine home in vats of wood. {#62:8}

As giving room and freedom, as most sweet, pour butter forth and milk,
O Indu, for the Aṅgirases. {#62:9}

Most active and benevolent, this Pavamana, sent to us
For lofty friendship, meditates. {#62:10}

Queller of curses, mighty, with strong sway, this Pavamana shall
Bring treasures to the worshipper. {#62:11}

Pour thou upon us thousandfold possessions, both of kine and steeds,
Exceeding glorious, much-desired. {#62:12}

Wandering far, with wise designs, the juice here present is effused,
Made beautiful by living men. {#62:13}

For Indra flows the gladdening drink, the measurer of the region, Sage,
With countless wealth and endless help. {#62:14}

Born on the inountain, lauded here, Indu for Indra is set down,
As in her sheltering nest a bird. {#62:15}

Pressed by the men, as ’twere to war hath Soma Pavamana sped,
To test with might within the vats. {#62:16}

That he may move, they yoke him to the three-backed triple-seated car
By the Seven Ṛṣis’ holy songs. {#62:17}

Drive ye that Tawny Courser, O ye pressers, on his way to war,
Swift Steed who carries off the spoil. {#62:18}

Pouring all glories hither, he, effused and entering the jar,
Stands like a hero mid the kine. {#62:19}

Indu, the living men milk out the juice to make the rapturous draught:
Gods for the Gods milk out the meath. {#62:20}

Pour for the Gods into the sieve our Soma very rich in sweets,
Him whom the Gods most gladly hear. {#62:21}

Into his stream who gladdens best these Soma juices have been poured,
Lauded with songs for lofty fame. {#62:22}

Thou flowest to enjoy the milk, and bringest valour, being cleansed:
Winning the spoil flow hitherward. {#62:23}

And, hymned by Jamadagnis, let all nourishment that kine supply,
And general praises, flow to us. {#62:24}

Soma, as leader of the song flow onward with thy wondrous aids,
For holy lore of every kind. {#62:25}

Do thou as leader of the song, stirring the waters of the sea,
Flow onward, thou who movest all. {#62:26}

O Soma, O thou Sage, these worlds stand ready to attest thy might:
For thy behoof the rivers flow. {#62:27}

Like showers of rain that fall from heaven thy streams perpetually flow
To the bright fleece spread under them. {#62:28}

For potent Indra purify Indu effectual and strong,
Enjoyment-giver, Mighty Lord. {#62:29}

Soma, true, Pavamana, Sage, is seated in the cleansing sieve,
Giving his praiser hero strength. {#62:30}

POUR hitherward, O Soma, wealth in thousands and heroic strength,
And keep renown secure for us. {#63:1}

Thou makest food and vigour swell for Indra, best of gladdeners!
Within the cups thou seatest thee. {#63:2}

For Indra and for Viṣṇu poured, Soma hath flowed into the jar:
May Vāyu find it rich in sweets. {#63:3}

These Somas swift and brown of hue, in stream of solemn sacrifice
Have flowed through twisted obstacles, {#63:4}

Performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength,
Driving away the godless ones. {#63:5}

Brown Soma-drops, effused that seek Indra, to their appropriate place
Flow through the region hitherward. {#63:6}

Flow onward with that stream of thine wherewith thou gavest Sūrya light,
Urging on waters good to men. {#63:7}

He, Pavamana, high o’er man yoked the Sun's courser Etaśa
To travel through the realm of air. {#63:8}

And those ten Coursers, tawny-hued, he harnessed that the Sun might come
Indu, he said, is Indra's self. {#63:9}

Hence, singers, pour the gladdeningjuice to Vāyu and to Indra, pour
The drops upon the fleecy cloth. {#63:10}

Send spoil of war and high renown. {#63:12}

Pouring the juice within the jar. {#63:13}

These brilliant drops have poured for us, in stream of solemn sacrifice,
Worshipful laws and strength in kine. {#63:14}

Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Somas, blent with curdled milk,
Effused for Indra Thunder-armed. {#63:15}

Soma, do thou most rich in sweets, a gladdening drink most dear to Gods,
Flow to the sieve to bring us wealth. {#63:16}

Pour for us, Soma, wealth in gold, in horses and heroic sons,
Bring hither strength in herds of kine. {#63:18}

For Indra pour ye on the fleece him very sweet to taste, who longs.
For battle as it were in war. {#63:19}

The singers, seeking help, adorn the Sage who must be decked with songs:
Loud bellowing the Steer comes on, {#63:20}

The singers with their thoughts and hymns have, in the stream of sacrifice,
Caused Soma, active Steer, to roar. {#63:21}

God, working with mankind, flow on; to Indra go thy gladdening juice:
To Vāyu mount as Law commands {#63:22}

O Soma, Pavamana, thou pourest out wealth that brings renown:
Enter the lake, as one we love. {#63:23}

Soma thou flowest chasing foes and bringing wisdom and delight:
Drive off the folk who love not Gods. {#63:24}

The Pavamanas have been poured, the brilliant drops of Soma juice,
For holy lore of every kind. {#63:25}

The Pavamanas have been shed, the beautiful swift Soma-drops,
Driving all enemies afar. {#63:26}

From, heaven, from out the firmament, hath Pavamana been effused
Upon the summit of the earth. {#63:27}

O Soma, Indu, very wise, drive, being purified, with thy stream
All foes, all Rākṣasas away. {#63:28}

Driving the Rākṣasas afar, O Soma, bellowing, pour for us
Most excellent and splendid strength. {#63:29}

Soma, do thou secure for us the treasures of the earih and heaven,
Indu, all boons to be desired. {#63:30}

From heaven and earth and firmament. {#64:6}

The streams of Pavamana, thine, Finder of all, have been effused,
Even as Sūrya's rays of light. {#64:7}

Making the light that shines from heaven thou flowest on to every form

Urged on thou sendest out thy voice, O Pavamana; thou hast moved,
Like the God Sūrya, to the sieve. {#64:9}

Accelerated by the hymn, the rapid drops of Soma juice
Have flowed, urged onward, to the lake. {#64:16}

Guard, hero like, our sheltering home. {#64:18}

Loud neighs the Courser Etaśa, with singers, harnessed for the place,
Guided for travel to the lake. {#64:19}

What time the Swift One resteth in the golden place of sacrifice,
He leaves the foolish far away. {#64:20}

The friends have sung in unison, the prudent wish to sacrifice:
Down sink the unintelligent. {#64:21}

For Indra girt by Maruts, flow, thou Indu, very rich in sweets,
To sit in place of sacrifice. {#64:22}

Of thee the winner of all wealth. {#65:9}

Or pressed among the Races Five- {#65:23}

May these celestial drops, expressed, pour forth upon us, as they flow,
Rain from the heavens apd hero strength. {#65:24}

Urged forward o’er the ox-hide flows the Lovely One of tawny hue,
Lauded by Jamadagni's song. {#65:25}

With milk, are beautified in streams. {#65:26}

So they who toil with juices send thee forward for the Gods’ repast:
So with this splendour flow thou on. {#65:27}

We choose to-day that chariot-steed of thine, the Strong, that brings us bliss,
The Guardian, the desire of all, {#65:28}

The Excellent, the Gladdener, the Sage with heart that understands,
The Guardian, the desire of all; {#65:29}

The Guardian, the desire of all. {#65:30}

THE drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One,
And, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering robe wherewith the udders stream. {#68:1}

He bellows with a roar arourd the highest twigs: the Tawny One is sweetened as he breaks them up.
Then passing through the sieve into the ample room, the God throws off the dregs according to his wish. {#68:2}

The gladdening drink that measured out the meeting Twins fills full with milk the Eternal Ever-waxing Pair.
Bringing to light the Two great Regions limitless, moving above them he gained sheen that never fades. {#68:3}

Wandering through, the Parents, strengthening the floods, the Sage makes his place swell with his own native might.
The stalk is mixed with grain: he comes led by the men together with the sisters, and preserves the Head. {#68:4}

With energetic intellect the Sage is born, deposited as germ of Law, far from the Twins.
They being young at first showed visibly distinct the Creature that is half-concealed and half-exposed. {#68:5}

The sages knew the form of him the Gladdener, what time the Falcon brought the plant from far away.
Him who assures success they beautified in streams, the stalk who yearned therefor, mighty and meet for praise. {#68:6}

Led by the men, with invocations of the Gods, through the fleece, thou hast given us strength to win the spoil. {#68:7}

With milk and waters is he decked when pressed with stones: Indu, when purified, shall find sweet rest and room. {#68:9}

## HYMN LXIX. Soma Pavamana.

LAID like an arrow on the bow the hymn hath been loosed like a young calf to the udder of its dam.
As one who cometh first with full stream she is milked the Soma is impelled to this man's holy rites. {#69:1}

The thought is deeply fixed; the savoury juice is shed; the tongue with joyous sound is stirring in the mouth;
And Pavamana, like the shout of combatants, the drop rising in sweet juice, is flowing through the fleece. {#69:2}

He flows about the sheep-skin, longing for a bride: he looses Aditi's Daughters for the worshipper.
The sacred drink hath come, gold-tinted, well-restrained: like a strong Bull he shines, whetting his manly might. {#69:3}

The Bull is bellowing; the Cows are coming nigh: the Goddesses approach the God's own resting-place.
Onward hath Soma passed through the sheep's fair bright fleece, and hath, as ’twere, endued a garment newly washed. {#69:4}

The golden-hued, Immortal, newly bathed, puts on a brightly shining vesture that is never harmed.
He made the ridge of heaven to be his radiant robe, by sprinkling of the bowls from moisture of the sky. {#69:5}

Even as the beams of Sūrya, urging men to speed, that cheer and send to sleep, together rush they forth,
These swift outpourings in long course of holy rites: no form save only Indra shows itself so pure. {#69:6}

As down the steep slope of a river to the vale, drawn from the Steer the swift strong draughts have found a way.
Well be it with the men and cattle in our home. May powers, O Soma, may the people stay with us. {#69:7}

Pour out upon us wealth in goods, in gold, in steeds, in cattle and in corn, and great heroic strength.
Ye, Soma, are my Fathers, lifted up on high as heads of heaven and makers of the strength of life. {#69:8}

These Pavamanas here, these drops of Soma, to Indra have sped forth like cars to booty.
Effused, they pass the cleansing fleece, while, gold-hued, they cast their covering off to pour the rain down. {#69:9}

O Indu, flow thou on for lofty Indra, flow blameless, very gracious, foe-destroyer.
Bring splendid treasures to the man who lauds thee. O Heaven and Earth, with all the Gods protect. us. {#69:10}

He gladly wrapped himself in the most lucid floods, when through their glory they found the God's resting-place. {#70:2}

May those his brilliant rays he ever free from death, inviolate, for both classes of created things,—
Rays wherewith powers of men and Gods are purified. Yea, even for this have sageswelcomed him as King. {#70:3}

While he is watching o’er the lovely Amṛta's ways, looks on both races as Beholder of mankind. {#70:4}

He, while he is adorned to stream forth mighty strength, rejoices in his place between the earth and heaven.
The Steer dispels the evil-hearted with his might, aiming at offerings as an archer at the game. {#70:5}

Beholding, as it were, Two Mother Cows, the Steer goes roaring on his way even as the Maruts roar.
Knowing Eternal Law, the earliest light of heaven, he, passing wise, was chosen out to tell it forth. {#70:6}

The fearful Bull is bellowing with violent might, far-sighted, sharpening his yellowcoloured horns.
Soma assumes his seat in the well-fashioned place: the cowhide and the sheepskin are his ornament. {#70:7}

Bright, making pure his body free from spot and stain, on the sheep's back the Golden-coloured hath flowed down.
Acceptable to Mitra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, he is prepared as threefold meal by skilful men. {#70:8}

Flow on for the God's banquet, Soma, as a Steer, and enter Indra's heart, the Soma's reservoir.
Bear us beyond misfortune ere we be oppres. sed. the man who knows the land directs the man who asks. {#70:9}

THE guerdon is bestowed: the Mighty takes his Seat, and, ever-Watchful, guards from fiend and evil sprite.
Gold-hued, he makes the cloud his diadem, the milk his carpet in both worlds, and prayer his robe of state. {#71:1}

Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who slays the folk; he lets this hue of Asuras flow off from him,
Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes. {#71:2}

STREAM on us riches that are sought by many, best at winning strength
Riches, O Indu, thousandfold, glorious, conquering the great. {#98:1}

Effused, he hath, as on a car, invested him in fleecy mail:
Onward hath Indu flowed in streams, impelled, surrounded by the wood. {#98:2}

Effused, this Indu hath flowed on, distilling rapture, to the fleece:
He goes erect, as seeking kine in stream, with light, to sacrifice. {#98:3}

For thou thyself, O Indu, God, to every mortal worshipper
Attractest riches thousandfold, made manifest in hundred forms. {#98:4}

Good Vṛtra-slayer, may we be still nearest to this wealth of thine
Which many crave, nearest to food and happiness, Resistless One! {#98:5}

Whom, bright with native splendour, crushed between the pair of pressingstones-
The wavy Friend whom Indra loves-the twice-five sisters dip and bathe, {#98:6}

Him with the fleece they purify, brown, golden-hued, beloved of all,
Who with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the Deities. {#98:7}

Through longing for this sap of yours ye drink what brings ability,
Even him who, dear as heaven's own light, gives to our princes high renown. {#98:8}

Indu at holy rites produced you, Heaven and Earth, the Friends of men,
Hill-haunting God the Goddesses. They bruised him where the roar was loud. {#98:9}

For Vṛtra-slaying Indra, thou, Soma, art poured that he may drink,
Poured for the guerdon-giving man, poured for the God who sitteth there. {#98:10}

These ancient Somas, at the break of day, have flowed into the sieve,
Snorting away at early morn these foolish evil-hearted ones. {#98:11}

Friends, may the princes, ye and we, obtain this Most Resplendent One.
Gain him who hath the smell of strength, win him whose home is very strength. {#98:12}

And he, made beautiful by night, dips forward into strengthening food',
What time the sacrificer's thoughts speed on his way the Golden-hued. {#99:2}

We cleanse this gladdening drink of his the juice which Indra chiefly drinks—-
That which kine took into their mouths, of old, and princes take it now. {#99:3}

And sacred songs which bear the names of Gods have supplicated him. {#99:4}

They purify him as he drops, courageous, in the fleecy sieve.
Him they instruct as messenger to bear the sage's morning prayer. {#99:5}

He penetrates the mighty floods collecting all he knows therein. {#99:7}

Striving within the votary's house thou drivest all the glooms away. {#100:8}

Thou, Pavamana hast assumed thy coat of mail in majesty. {#100:9}

Seven regions have their several Suns; the ministering priests are seven;
Seven are the Āditya Deities,—with these, O Soma, guard thou us. Flow, Indu, flow for Indra's sake. {#114:3}

Guard us with this oblation which, King Soma, hath been dressed for thee. {#114:4}
