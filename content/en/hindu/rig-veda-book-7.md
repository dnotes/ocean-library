## HYMN I. Agni.

THE men from fire-sticks, with their hands' swift movement, have, in deep thought, engendered glorious Agni,
Far-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the homestead. {#1:1}

The Vasus set that Agni in the dwelling, fair to behold, for help from every quarter:
Who, in the home for ever, must be honoured. {#1:2}

Shine thou before us, Agni, well-enkindled, with flame, Most Youthful God, that never fadeth.
To thee come all our sacrificial viands. {#1:3}

Among all fires these fires have shone most brightly, splendid with light, begirt by noble heroes,
Where men of lofty birth sit down together. {#1:4}

Victorious Agni, grant us wealth with wisdom, wealth with brave sons, famous and independent,
Which not a foe who deals in magic conquers. {#1:5}

To whom, the Strong, at morn and eve comes, maid-like, the ladle dropping oil, with its oblation.
Wealth-seeking comes to him his own devotion. {#1:6}

Burn up all malice with those flames, O Agni, wherewith of old thou burntest up Jarutha,
And drive away in silence pain and sickness. {#1:7}

With him who lighteth up thy splendour, Agni, excellent, pure, refulgent, Purifier,
Be present, and with us through these our praises. {#1:8}

Agni, the patriarchal men, the mortals who have in many places spread thy lustre,—
Be gracious to us here for their sake also. {#1:9}

Let these men, heroes in the fight with foemen, prevail against all godless arts of 4magic,—
These who ipprove the noble song I sing thee. {#1:10}

Let us not sit in want of men, O Agni, without descendants, heroleu, about thee:
But, O House-Friend, in houses full of children. {#1:11}

By sacrifice which the Steeds' Lord ever visits, there make our dwelling rich in seed and offspring,
Increasing still with lineal successors. {#1:12}

Guard us, O Agni, from the hated demon, guard us from malice of the churlish sinner:
Allied with thee may I subdue assailants. {#1:13}

May this same fire of mine surpass all others, this fire where offspring, vigorous and firm-handed,
Wins, on a thousand paths, what ne’er shall perish. {#1:14}

This is that Agni, saviour from the foeman, who guards the kindler of the flame from sorrow:
Heroes of noble lineage serve and tend him. {#1:15}

This is that Agni, served in many places, whom the rich lord who brings oblation kindles,
And round him goes the priest at sacrifices. {#1:16}

Agni, may we with riches in possession bring thee continual ofierings in abundance,
Using both means to draw thee to our worship. {#1:17}

Agni, bear thou, Eternal, these most welcome oblations to the Deities' assembly:
Let them enjoy our very fragrant presents. {#1:18}

Give us not up, Agni, to want of heroes, to wretched clothes, to need, to destitution.
Yield us not, Holy One, to fiend or hunger; injure us not at home or in the forest. {#1:19}

Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour blessings on our chiefs and nobles.
Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings. {#1:20}

Thou Agni, swift to hear, art fair of aspect: beam forth, O Son of Strength, in full effulgence.
Let me not want, with thee, a son for ever: let not a manly hero ever fail us. {#1:21}

Condemn us not to indigence, O Agni, beside these flaming fires which Gods have kindled;
Nor, even after fault, let thy displeasure, thine as a God, O Son of Strength, o’ertake us. {#1:22}

O Agni, fair of face, the wealthy mortal who to the Immortal offers his oblation.
Hath him who wins him treasure by his Godhead, to whom the prince, in need, goes supplicating. {#1:23}

Knowing our chief felicity, O Agni, bring hither ample riches to our nobles,
Wherewith we may enjoy ourselves, O Victor, with undiminished life and hero children. {#1:24}

Give strength and power to these my prayers, O Agni; O God, pour blessings on bur chiefs and nobles.
Grant that both we and they may share thy bounty. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings. {#1:25}

## HYMN II. Āprīs.

GLADLY accept, this day, our fuel, Agni: send up thy sacred smoke and shine sublimely.
Touch the celestial summits with thy columns, and overspread thee with the rays of Sūrya. {#2:1}

With sacrifice to these we men will honour the majesty of holy Narāśaṁsa-
To these the pure, most wise, the thought. inspirers, Gods who enjoy both sorts of our oblations. {#2:2}

We will extol at sacrifice for ever, as men may do, Agni whom Manu kindled,
Your very skilful Asura, meet for worship, envoy between both worlds, the truthful speaker. {#2:3}

Bearing the sacred grass, the men who serve him strew it with reverence, on their knees, by Agni.
Calling him to the spotted grass, oil-sprinkled, adorn him, ye Adhvaryus, with oblation. {#2:4}

With holy thoughts the pious have thrown open Doors fain for chariots in the Gods’ assembly.
Like two full mother cows who lick their youngling, like maidens for the gathering, they adorn them. {#2:5}

And let the two exalted Heavenly Ladies, Morning and Night, like a cow good at milking,
Come, much-invoked, and on our grass be seated ' wealthy, deserving worship, for our welfare. {#2:6}

You, Bards and Singers at men's sacrifices, both filled with wisdom, I incline to worship.
Send up our offerings when we call upon you, and so among the Gods obtain us treasures. {#2:7}

May Bhāratī with all her Sisters, Iḷā accordant with the Gods, with mortals Agni,
Sarasvatī with all her kindred Rivers, come to this grass, Three Goddesses, and seat them. {#2:8}

Well pleased with us do thou, O God, O Tvaṣṭar, give ready issue to our procreant vigour,
Whence springs the hero, powerful, skilled in action, lover of Gods, adjuster of the press-stones. {#2:9}

Send to the Gods the oblation, Lord of Forests, and let the Immolator, Agni, dress it.
He as the truer Priest shall offer worship, for the God'sgenerations well he knoweth. {#2:10}

Come thou to us, O Agni, duly kindled, together with the potent Gods and Indra.
On this our grass sit Aditi, happy Mother, and let our Hail! delight the Gods Immortal. {#2:11}

## HYMN III. Agni.

ASSOCIATE with fires, make your God Agni envoy at sacrifice, best skilled in worship,
Established firm among mankind, the Holy, flame-crowned and fed with oil, the Purifier. {#3:1}

Then the wind following blows upon his splendour, and, straight, the path is black which thou hast travelled. {#3:2}

From thee a Bull but newly born, O Agni, the kindled everlasting flames rise upward.
Aloft to heaven thy ruddy smoke ascendeth: Agni, thou speedest to the Gods as envoy. {#3:3}

Thou whose fresh lustre o’er the earth advanceth when greedily with thy jaws thy food thou eatest.
Like a host hurried onward comes thy lasso: fierce, with thy tongue thou piercest, as ’twere barley. {#3:4}

The men have decked him both at eve and morning, Most Youthful Agni, as they tend a courser.
They kindle him, a guest within his dwelling: bright shines the splendour of the worshipped Hero. {#3:5}

O fair of face, beautiful is thine aspect when, very near at hand, like gold thou gleamest,
Like Heaven's thundering roar thy might approaches, and like the wondrous Sun thy light thou showest. {#3:6}

That we may worship, with your Hail to Agni! with sacrificial cakes and fat oblations,
Guard us, O Agni, with those boundless glories as with a hundred fortresses of iron. {#3:7}

Thine are resistless songs for him who offers, and hero-giving hymns wherewith thou savest;
With these, O Son of Strength, O Jātavedas, guard us, preserve these princes and the singers. {#3:8}

When forth he cometh, like an axe new-sharpened, pure in his form, resplendent in his body,
Sprung, sought with eager longing, from his Parents, for the Gods’ worship, Sage and Purifier: {#3:9}

Shine this felicity on us, O Agni: may we attain to perfect understanding.
All happiness be theirs who sing and praise thee. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore with blessings. {#3:10}

The Anavas and Druhyus, seeking booty, have slept, the sixty hundred, yea, six thousand,
And six-and-sixty heroes. For the pious were all these mighty exploits done by Indra. {#18:14}

These Trtsus under Indra's careful guidance came speeding like loosed waters rushing downward.
The foemen, measuring exceeding closely, abandoned to Sudās all their provisions. {#18:15}

The hero's side who drank the dressed oblation, Indra's denier, far o’er earth he scattered.
Indra brought down the fierce destroyer's fury. He gave them various roads, the path's Controller. {#18:16}

E’en with the weak he wrought this matchless exploit: e’en with a goat he did to death a lion.
He pared the pillar's angles with a needle. Thus to Sudās Indra gave all provisions. {#18:17}

To thee have all thine enemies submitted: e’en the fierce Bheda hast thou made thy subject.
Cast down thy sharpened thunderbolt, O Indra, on him who harms the men who sing thy praises. {#18:18}

Yamuna and the Trtsus aided Indra. There he stripped Bheda bare of all his treasures.
The Ajas and the Sigrus and the Yaksus brought in to him as tribute heads of horses. {#18:19}

Not to be scorned, but like Dawns past and recent, O Indra, are thy favours and thy riches.
Devaka, Mānyamana's son, thou slewest, and smotest Śambara from the lofty mountain. {#18:20}

They who, from home, have gladdened thee, thy servants Parasara, Vasiṣṭha, Satayatu,
Will not forget thy friendship, liberal Giver. So shall the days dawn prosperous for the princes. {#18:21}

Priest-like, with praise, I move around the altar, earning Paijavana's reward, O Agni,
Two hundred cows from Devavan's descendant, two chariots from Sudās with mares to draw them. {#18:22}

Gift of Paijavana, four horses bear me in foremost place, trained steeds with pearl to deck them.
Sudās's brown steeds, firmly-stepping, carry me and my son for progeny and glory. {#18:23}

Him whose fame spreads between wide earth and heaven, who, as dispenser, gives each chief his portion,
Seven flowing Rivers glorify like Indra. He slew Yudhyamadhi in close encounter. {#18:24}

Attend on him O ye heroic Maruts as on Sudās's father Divodāsa.
Further Paijavana's desire with favour. Guard faithfully his lasting firm dominion. {#18:25}

Thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught; thou slewest Namuci, thou slewest Vṛtra. {#19:5}

Old are the blessings, Indra, which thou gavest Sudās the worshipper who brought oblations.
For thee, the Strong, I yoke thy strong Bay Horses: may our prayers reach thee and win strength, Most Mighty! {#19:6}

Give us not up, Lord of Bay Horses, Victor, in this thine own assembly, to the wicked.
Deliver us with true and faithful succours: dear may we be to thee among the princes. {#19:7}

May we men, Maghavan, the friends thou lovest, near thee be joyful under thy protection.
Fain to fulfil the wish of Atithigva humble. the pride of Turvaśa and Yadva. {#19:8}

Swiftly, in truth, O Maghavan, about thee men skilled in hymning sing their songs and praises. '
Elect us also into their assembly who by their calls on thee despoiled the niggards. {#19:9}

Thine are these lauds, O manliest of heroes, lauds which revert to us and give us riches.
Favour these, Indra, when they fight with faemen, as Friend and Hero and the heroes' Helper. {#19:10}

Now, lauded for thine aid, Heroic Indra, sped by our prayer, wax mighty in thy body.
Apportion to us strength and habitations. Ye Gods, protect us evermore with blessings. {#19:11}

## HYMN XXXIII Vasiṣṭha.

THESE who wear hair-knots on the right, the movers of holy thought, white-robed, have won me over.
I warned the men, when from the grass I raised me, Not from afar can my Vasisthas help you. {#33:1}

With Soma they brought Indra from a distance, Over Vaisanta, from the strong libation.
Indra preferred Vasisthas to the Soma pressed by the son of Vayata, Pasadyumna. {#33:2}

So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he slaughtered Bheda.
So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sudās through your devotions. {#33:3}

I gladly, men I with prayer prayed by our fathers have fixed your axle: ye shall not be injured:
Since, when ye sang aloud the Sakvari verses, Vasisthas! ye invigorated Indra. {#33:4}

Like thirsty men they looked to heaven, in battle with the Ten Kings, surrounded and imploring.
Then Indra heard Vasiṣṭha as he praised him, and gave the Trtsus ample room and freedom. {#33:5}

Like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle, Stripped bare, the Bharatas were found defenceless:
Vasiṣṭha then became their chief and leader: then widely. were the Trtsus' clans extended. {#33:6}

Three fertilize the worlds with genial moisture: three noble Creatures cast a light before them.
Three that give warmth to all attend the morning. All these have they discovered, these Vasisthas. {#33:7}

Like the Sun's growing glory is their splendour, and like the sea's is their unflathomed greatness.
Their course is like the wind's. Your laud, Vasisthas, can never be attained by any other. {#33:8}

They with perceptions of the heart in secret resort to that which spreads a thousand branches.
The Apsaras brought hither the Vasisthas wearing the vesture spun for them by Yama. {#33:9}

A form of lustre springing from the lightning wast thou, when Varuṇa and Mitra saw thee.
Tliy one and only birth was then, Vasiṣṭha, when from thy stock Agastya brought thee hither. {#33:10}

Born of their love for Urvasi, Vasiṣṭha thou, priest, art son of Varuṇa and Mitra;
And as a fallen drop, in heavenly fervour, all the Gods laid thee on a lotus-blossorn. {#33:11}

He thinker, knower both of earth and heaven, endowed with many a gift, bestowing thousands,
Destined to wear the vesture spun by Yama, sprang from the Apsaras to life, Vasiṣṭha. {#33:12}

Born at the sacrifice, urged by adorations, both with a common flow bedewed the pitcher.
Then from the midst thereof there rose up Māna, and thence they say was born the sage Vasiṣṭha. {#33:13}

He brings the bearer of the laud and Sāman: first shall he speak bringing the stone for pressing.
With grateful hearts in reverence approach him: to you, O Pratrdas, Vasiṣṭha cometh. {#33:14}

To these our heroes may they grant renown: may pious men march boldly on to wealth. {#34:18}

Leading great hosts, with fierce attacks of these, they burn their foes as the Sun burns the earth. {#34:19}

What time our wives draw near to us, may he, left-handed Tvaṣṭar, give us hero sons. {#34:20}

With lofty ridges earth is far extended, and Agni's flame hath lit the spacious surface. {#36:1}

O Asuras, O Varuṇa and Mitra, this hymn to you, like food, anew I offer.
One of you is a strong unerring Leader, and Mitra, speaking, stirreth men to labour. {#36:2}

The movements of the gliding wind come hither: like cows, the springs are filled to overflowing.
Born in the station e’en of lofty heaven the Bull hath loudly bellowed in this region. {#36:3}

Voracious, with thy noble car, O Hero, him who defeats the wrath of the malicious. {#36:4}

He hath poured food on men when they have praised him; be this, the dearest reverence, paid to Rudra. {#36:5}

Coming together, glorious, loudly roaring - Sarasvatī, Mother of Floods, the seventh-
With copious milk, with fair streams, strongly flowing, full swelling with the volume of their water; {#36:6}

And may the mighty Maruts, too, rejoicing, aid our devotion and protect our offspring.
Let not swift-moving Aksara neglect us: they have increased our own appropriate riches, {#36:7}

Spreading afar thy broad and wide effulgence, and bringing mortal men the food that feeds them. {#38:2}

Sweet be our lauds to him whose due is worship: may he with all protection guard our princes. {#38:3}

Even he who praise the high imperial Rulers, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, sing in concert. {#38:4}

They who come emulous to our oblation, dispensing bounty, from the earth and heaven.
May they and Ahibudhnya hear our calling: guard us Varūtrī with the Ekadhenus. {#38:5}

This may the Lord of Life, entreated, grant us,—the wealth which Savitar the God possesses.
The mighty calls on Bhaga for protection, on Bhaga calls the weak to give him riches. {#38:6}

At the folks early call on Night and Morning,—Vāyu, and Pūṣan with his team, to bless us. {#39:2}

Here on their path the noble Gods proceeded: in the wide firmament the Beauteous decked them.
Bend your way hither, ye who travel widely: hear this our envoy who hath gone to meet you. {#39:3}

For they are holy aids at sacrifices: all Gods approach the place of congregation.
Bring these, desirous, to our worship, Agni, swift the Nisatyas, Bhaga, and Purandhi. {#39:4}

Agni, to these men's hymns, from earth, from heaven, bring Mitra, Varuṇa, Indra, and Agni,
And Aryaman, and Aditi, and Viṣṇu. Sarasvatī be joyful, and the Maruts. {#39:5}

Divine and foeless Aditi quickly listens. May these deliver us unharmed from trouble. {#40:4}

With offerings I propitiate the branches of this swift-moving God, the bounteous Viṣṇu.
Hence Rudra gained his Rudra-strength: O Aśvins, ye sought the house that hath celestial viands. {#40:5}

Be not thou angry here, O glowing Pūṣan, for what Varūtrī and the Bounteous gave us.
May the swift-moving Gods protect and bless us, and Vāta send us rain, wha wanders round us. {#40:6}

Now have both worlds been praised by the Vasisthas, and holy Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.

AGNI at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuṇa and Mitra, and the Aśvins twain.
Bhaga at dawn, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, Soma at dawn, Rudra we will invoke at dawn. {#41:1}

We will invoke strong, early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of Aditi, the great supporter:
Thinking of whom, the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the King himself says, Give me Bhaga. {#41:2}

Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this song, and give us wealth, O Bhaga.
Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses, Bhaga, may we be rich in men and heroes. {#41:3}

So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day approaches, and at noontide;
And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in the Deities' loving-kindness. {#41:4}

May Bhaga verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods! may happiness attend us.
As such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be thou our Champion here, O Bhaga. {#41:5}

To this our worship may all Dawns incline them, and come to the pure place like Dadhikrāvan.
As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring us hitherward Bhaga who discovers treasure. {#41:6}

Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#41:7}

## HYMN XLII Viśvedevas.

LET Brahmans and Aṅgirases come forward, and let the roar of cloudy heaven surround us.
Loud low the Milch-kine swimming in the waters: set be the stones that grace our holy service. {#42:1}

Fair, Agni, is thy long-known path to travel: yoke for the juice tfiy bay, thy ruddy horses,
Or red steeds, Hero-bearing, for the chamber. Seated, I call the Deities' generations. {#42:2}

They glorify your sacrifice with worship, yet the glad Priest near them is left unequalled.
Bring the Gods hither, thou of many aspects: turn hitherward Aramati the Holy. {#42:3}

What time the Guest hath made himself apparent, at ease reclining in the rich man's dwelling,
Agni, well-pleased, well-placed within the chamber gives to a house like this wealth worth the choosing. {#42:4}

Accept this sacrifice of ours, O Agni; glorify it with Indra and the Maruts.
Here on our grass let Night and Dawn be seated: bring longing Varuṇa and Mitra hither. {#42:5}

Thus hath Vasiṣṭha praised victorious Agni, yearning for wealth that giveth all subsistence.
May he bestow on us food, strength, and riches. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#42:6}

## HYMN XLIII Viśvedevas.

SING out the pious at your sacrifices to move with adorations Earth and Heaven-
The Holy Singers, whose unmatched devotions, like a tree's branches, part in all directions. {#43:1}

Let sacrifice proceed like some fleet courser: with one accord lift ye on high the ladles.
Strew sacred grass meet for the solenm service: bright flames that love the Gods have mounted upward. {#43:2}

Like babes in arms reposing on their mother, let the Gods sit upon the grass's summit.
Let general fire make bright the flame of worship: scorn us not, Agni, in the Gods’ assembly. {#43:3}

Gladly the Gods have let themselves be honoured, milking the copious streams of holy Order.
The highest might to-day is yours, the Vasits': come ye, as many as ye are, one-minded. {#43:4}

Unharmed, and rich, and taking joy together. Preserve us evermore, ye ods, with blessings. {#43:5}

## HYMN XLIV. Dadhikrās.

I CALL on Dadhikrās, the first, to give you aid, the Aśvins, Bhaga, Dawn, and Agni kindled well,
Indra, and Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, Brahmaṇaspati, Ādityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, and the Light. {#44:1}

When, rising, to the sacrifice we hasten, awaking Dadhikrās with adorations.
Seating on sacred grass the Goddess Iḷā. let us invoke the sage swift-hearing Aśvins. {#44:2}

While I am thus arousing Dadhikrāvan I speak to Agni, Earth, and Dawn, and Sūrya,
The red, the brown of Varuṇa ever mindful: may they ward off from us all grief and trouble. {#44:3}

Foremost is Dadhikrāvan, vigorous courser; in forefront of the cars, his way he knoweth,
Closely allied with Sūrya and with Morning, Ādityas, and Aṅgirases, and Vasus. {#44:4}

Now shall that mightiness of his he lauded: even Sūrya yields to him in active vigour. {#45:2}

May this God Savitar, the Strong and Mighty, the Lord of precious wealth, vouchsafe us treasures.
May he, advancing his far-spreading lustre, bestow on us the food that feedeth mortals. {#45:3}

These songs praise Savitar whose tongue is pleasant, praise him whose arms are full, whose hands are lovely.
High vital strength, and manifold, may he grant us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#45:4}

Come willingly to our doors that gladly welcome thee, and heal all sickness, Rudra., in our families. {#46:2}

Thou, very gracious God, hast thousand medicines: inflict no evil on our sons or progeny. {#46:3}

May Vāja aid us in the fight for booty, and helped by Indra may we quell the foeman. {#48:2}

For they rule many tribes with high dominion, and conquer all their foes in close encounter.
May Indra, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Ṛbhukṣan destroy by turns the wicked foeman's valour. {#48:3}

Now, Deities, give us ample room and freedom: be all of you, one-minded, our protection.
So let the Vasus grant us strength and vigour. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#48:4}

Distilling meath, the bright, the purifying, here let those Waters, Goddesses, protect me. {#49:3}

O MITRA-VARUNA, guard and protect me here: let not that come to me which nests within and swells.
I drive afar the scorpion hateful to the sight: let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot. {#50:1}

Eruption that appears upon the twofold joints, and that which overspreads the ankles and the knees,
May the refulgent Agni banish far away let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot. {#50:2}

The poison that is formed upon the Salmali, that which is found in streams, that which the plants produce,
All this may all the Gods banish and drive away: let not the winding worm touch me and wound my foot. {#50:3}

The steep declivities, the valleys, and the heights, the channels full of water, and the waterless-

VASTOSPATI, who killest all disease and wearest every form,
Be an auspicious Friend to us. {#55:1}

When, O bright Son of Saramā, thou showest, tawny-hued! thy teeth,
They gleam like lances' points within thy mouth when thou wouldst bite; go thou to steep. {#55:2}

Saramā's Son, retrace thy way: bark at the robber and the thief.
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dust thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep. {#55:3}

Be on thy guard against the boar, and let the boar beware of thee.
At Indra's singers barkest thou? Why dost thou seek to terrify us? Go to sleep. {#55:4}

Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog and master of the house.
Let all the kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round about. {#55:5}

The man who sits, the man who walks, and whosoever looks on us,
Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this house. {#55:6}

The Bull who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the sea,—
By him the Strong and Mighty One we lull and make the people sleep. {#55:7}

The women sleeping in the court, lying without, or stretched on beds,
The matrons with their odorous sweetsthese, one and all, we lull to sleep. {#55:8}

## HYMN LVI. Maruts.

Wno are these radiant men in serried rank, Rudra's young heroes borne by noble steeds? {#56:1}

Verily no one knoweth whence they sprang: they, and they only, know each other's birth. {#56:2}

They strew each other with their blasts, these Hawks: they strove together, roaring like the wind. {#56:3}

A sage was he who knew these mysteries, what in her udder mighty Pṛśni bore. {#56:4}

Ever victorious, through the Maruts, be this band of Heroes, nursing manly strength, {#56:5}

Most bright in splendour, flectest on their way, close-knit to glory, strong with varied power. {#56:6}

Yea, mighty is your power and firm your strength: so, potent, with the Maruts, be the band. {#56:7}

Bright is your spirit, wrathful are your minds: your bold troop's minstrel is like one inspired. {#56:8}

Ever avert your blazing shaft from us, and let not your displeasure reach us here {#56:9}

Your dear names, conquering Maruts, we invoke, calling aloud till we are satisfied. {#56:10}

Well-armed, impetuous in their haste, they deck themselves, their forms, with oblations: to you, the pure, ornaments made of gold. {#56:11}

Pure, Maruts, pure yourselves, are your oblations: to you, the pure, pure sacrifice I offer.
By Law they came to truth, the Law's observers, bright by their birth, and pure, and sanctifying. {#56:12}

Your rings, O Maruts, rest upon your shoulders, and chains of gold are twined upon your bosoms.
Gleaming with drops of rain, like lightning-flashes, after your wont ye whirl about your weapons. {#56:13}

Wide in the depth of air spread forth your glories, far, most adorable, ye bear your titles.
Maruts, accept this thousandfold allotment of household sacrifice and household treasure. {#56:14}

If, Maruts, ye regard the praise recited here at this mighty singer invocation,
Vouchsafe us quickly wealth with noble heroes, wealth which no man uho hateth us may injure. {#56:15}

The Maruts, fleet as coursers, while they deck them like youths spectators of a festal meeting,
Linger, like beauteous colts, about the dwelling, like frisking calves, these who pour down the water. {#56:16}

So may the Maruts help us and be gracious, bringing free room to lovely Earth and Heaven.
Far be your bolt that slayeth men and cattle. Ye Vasus, turn yourselves to us with blessings. {#56:17}

The priest, when seated, loudly calls you, Maruts, praising in song your universal bounty.
He, Bulls! who hath so much in his possession, free from duplicity, with hymns invokes you. {#56:18}

These Maruts bring the swift man to a stand-still, and strength with mightier strength they break and humble
These guard the singer from the man who hates him and lay their sore displeasure on the wicked. {#56:19}

These Maruts rouse even the poor and needy: the Vasus love him as an active champion.
Drive to a distance, O ye Bulls, the darkness: give us full store of children and descendants. {#56:20}

What secret sin or open stirs their anger, that we implore the Swift Ones to forgive us. {#58:5}

What gift of mine will he accept unangered? When may I calmly look and find him gracious? {#86:2}

Fain to know this is my sin I question others: I seek the wise, O Varuṇa, and ask them.
This one same answer even the sages gave me, "Surely this Varuṇa is angry with thee." {#86:3}

What, Varuṇa, hath been my chief transgression, that thou wouldst slay the friend who sings thy praises?
Tell me, Unconquerable Lord, and quickly sinless will I approach thee with mine homage. {#86:4}

Free us from sins committed by our fathers, from those wherein we have ourselves offended.
O King, loose, like a thief who feeds the cattle, as from the cord a calf, set free Vasiṣṭha. {#86:5}

Not our own will betrayed us, but seduction, thoughtlessness, Varuṇa wine, dice, or anger.
The old is near to lead astray the younger: even sleep removeth not all evil-doing. {#86:6}

Slavelike may I do service to the Bounteous, serve, free from sin, the God inclined to anger.
This gentle Lord gives wisdom to the simple: the wiser God leads on the wise to riches. {#86:7}

Within these two, exalted Earth and Heaven, O Varuṇa, are all the forms thou lovest. {#87:2}

Wise are they, holy, skilled in sacrifices, the furtherers of the praise-songs of the prudent. {#87:3}

The wise King Varuṇa hath made in heaven that Golden Swing to cover it with glory. {#87:5}

We, when we ride o’er ridges of the waters, will swing within that swing and there be happy. {#88:3}

Varuṇa placed Vasiṣṭha in the vessel, and deftly with his niight made him a Ṛṣi.
When days shone bright the Sage made him a singer, while the heavens broadened and the Dawns were lengthened. {#88:4}

What hath become of those our ancient friendships, when without enmity we walked together?
I, Varuṇa, thou glorious Lord, have entered thy lofty home, thine house with thousand portals. {#88:5}

If he, thy true ally, hath sinned against thee, still, Varuṇa, he is the friend thou lovedst.
Let us not, Living One, as sinners I know thee: give shelter, as a Sage, to him who lauds thee. {#88:6}

While we abide in these fixed habitations, and from the lap of Aditi win favour,
May Varuṇa untie the bond that binds us. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#88:7}

O Indra, thou hast filled mid-air's wide region, and given the Gods by battle room and freedom. {#98:3}

When thou hast urged the arrocrant to combat, proud in their strength of arm, we will subdue them.
Or, Indra, when thou fightest girt by heroes, we in the glorious fray with thee will conquer. {#98:4}

I will declare the earliest deeds of Indra, and recent acts which Maghavan hath accomplished.
When he had conquered godless wiles and magic, Soma became his own entire possession. {#98:5}

Thine is this world of flocks and herds around thee, which with the eye of Sūrya thou beholdest.
Thou, Indra, art alone the Lord of cattle; may we enjoy the treasure which thou givest. {#98:6}

Ye Twain are Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O Bṛhaspati, and thou, O Indra.
Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#98:7}

## HYMN XCIX. Viṣṇu.

MEN come not nigh thy majesty who growest beyond all bound and measure with thy body.
Both thy two regions of the earth, O Viṣṇu, we know: thou God, knowest the highest also. {#99:1}

None who is born or being born, God Viṣṇu, hath reached the utmost limit of thy grandeur.
The vast high vault of heaven hast thou supported, and fixed earth's eastern pinnacle securely. {#99:2}

Rich in sweet food be ye, and rich in milch-kine, with fertile pastures, fain to do men service.
Both these worlds, Viṣṇu, hast thou stayed asunder, and firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it. {#99:3}

Ye have made spacious room for sacrificing by generating Sūrya, Dawn, and Agni.
O Heroes, ye have conquered in your battles even the bull-jawed Dāsa's wiles and magic. {#99:4}

Ye have destroyed, thou, Indra, and thou Viṣṇu, Śambara's nine-and-ninety fenced castles.
Ye Twain smote down a hundred times a thousand resistless heroes of the royal Varcin. {#99:5}

This is the lofty hymn of praise, exalting the Lords of Mighty Stride, the strong and lofty.
I laud you in the solemn synods, Viṣṇu: pour ye food on us in our camps, O Indra. {#99:6}

O Viṣṇu, unto thee my lips cry Vaṣaṭ! Let this mine offering, Sipivista, please thee.
May these my songs of eulogy exalt thee. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#99:7}

## HYMN C. Viṣṇu.

NE’ER doth the man repent, who, seeking profit, bringeth his gift to the far-striding Viṣṇu.
He who adoreth him with all his spirit winneth himself so great a benefactor. {#100:1}

Thou, Viṣṇu, constant in thy courses, gavest good-will to all men, and a hymn that lasteth,
That thou mightst move us to abundant comfort of very splendid wealth with store of horses. {#100:2}

Three times strode forth this God in all his grandeur over this earth bright with a hundred splendours.
Foremost be Viṣṇu, stronger than the strongest: for glorious is his name who lives for ever. {#100:3}

Over this earth with mighty step strode Viṣṇu, ready to give it for a home to Manu.
In him the humble people trust for safety: he, nobly born, hath made them spacious dwellings. {#100:4}

To-day I laud this name, O gipivista, I, skilled in rules, the name of thee the Noble.
Yea, I the poor and weak praise thee the Mighty who dwellest in the realm beyond this region. {#100:5}

What was there to be blamed in thee, O Viṣṇu, when thou declaredst, I am Sipivista?
Hide not this form from us, nor keep it secret, since thou didst wear another shape in battle. {#100:6}

O Viṣṇu, unto thee my lips cry Vaṣaṭ! Let this mine offering, Sipivista, please thee.
May these my songs of eulogy exalt thee. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#100:7}

## HYMN CI. Parjanya.

SPEAK forth three words, the words which light precedeth, which milk this udder that produceth nectar.
Quickly made manifest, the Bull hath bellowed, engendering the germ of plants, the Infant. {#101:1}

Giver of growth to plants, the God who ruleth over the waters and all moving creatures,
Vouchsafe us triple shelter for our refuge, and threefold light to succour and befriend us. {#101:2}

Now he is sterile, now begetteth offspring, even as he willeth doth he change his figure.
The Father's genial flow bedews the Mother; therewith the Sire, therewith the son is nourished. {#101:3}

In him all living creatures have their being, and the three heavens with triply-flowing waters.
Three reservoirs that sprinkle down their treasure shed their sweet streams around him with a murmur. {#101:4}

May this my song to Sovran Lord Parjanya come near unto his heart and give him pleasure.
May we obtain the showers that bring enjoyment, and God-protected plants with goodly fruitage. {#101:5}

He is the Bull of all, and their impregner: he holds the life of all things fixed and moving.
May this rite save me till my hundredth autumn. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings. {#101:6}

* * *

## HYMN CII Parjanya.

SING forth and laud Parjanya, son of Heaven, who sends the gift of rain
May he provide our pasturage. {#102:1}

Parjanya is the God who forms in kine, in mares, in plants of earth,
And womankind, the germ of life. {#102:2}

Offer and pour into his mouth oblation rich in savoury juice:
May he for ever give us food. {#102:3}

* * *

## HYMN CIII. Frogs.

THEY who lay quiet for a year, the Brahmans who fulfil their vows,
The Frogs have lifted up their voice, the voice Parjanya hath inspired. {#103:1}

What time on these, as on a dry skin lying in the pool's bed, the floods of heaven descended,
The music of the Frogs comes forth in concert like the cows lowing with their calves beside them. {#103:2}

When at the coming of the Rains the water has poured upon them as they yearned and thirsted,
One seeks another as he talks and greets him with cries of pleasure as a son his father. {#103:3}

Each of these twain receives the other kindly, while they are revelling in the flow of waters,
When the Frog moistened by the rain springs forward, and Green and Spotty both combine their voices. {#103:4}

When one of these repeats the other's language, as he who learns the lesson of the teacher,
Your every limb seems to be growing larger as ye converse with eloquence on the waters. {#103:5}

Onc is Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat the other, one Frog is Green and one of them is Spotty.
They bear one common name, and yet they vary, and, talking, modulate the voice diversely. {#103:6}

As Brahmans, sitting round the brimful vessel, talk at the Soma-rite of Atiratra,
So, Frogs, ye gather round the pool to honour this day of all the year, the first of Rain-time. {#103:7}

These Brahmans with the Soma juice, performing their year-long rite, have lifted up their voices;
And these Adhvaryus, sweating with their kettles, come forth and show themselves, and none are hidden. {#103:8}

They keep the twelve month's God-appointed order, and never do the men neglect the season.
Soon as the Rain-time in the year returneth, these who were heated kettles gain their freedom. {#103:9}

Cow-bellow and Goat-bleat have granted riches, and Green and Spotty have vouchsafed us treasure.
The Frogs who give us cows in hundreds lengthen our lives in this most fertilizing season. {#103:10}

## HYMN CIV. Indra-Soma.

INDRA and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe, send downward, O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom.
Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them away from us, pierce the voracious ones. {#104:1}

Indra and Soma, let sin round the wicked boil like as a caldron set amid the flames of fire.
Against the foe of prayer, devourer of raw flesh, the vile fiend fierce of eye, keep ye perpetual hate. {#104:2}

Indra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them into darkness that hath no support,
So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your wrathful might prevail and conquer them. {#104:3}

Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth.
Yea, forge out of the mountains your celestial dart wherewith ye burn to death the waxing demon race. {#104:4}

Indra and Soma, cast ye downward out of heaven your deadly darts of stone burning with fiery flame,
Eternal, scorching darts; plunge the voracious ones within the depth, and let them sink without a sound. {#104:5}

Indra and Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the girth encompasses two vigorous steeds-
The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you: do ye, as Lords of men, animate these my prayers. {#104:6}

In your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy these evil beings, slay the treacherous fiends.
Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss who evermore assails us with malignity. {#104:7}

Whoso accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my way with guileless spirit,
May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra, like water which the hollowed hand compresses. {#104:8}

Those who destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their evil natures barm the righteous,
May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of Nirrti consign them. {#104:9}

The fiend, O Agni, who designs to injure the essence of our food, kine, steeds, or bodies,
May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction, both himself and offipring. {#104:10}

May he be swept away, himself and children: may all the three earths press him down beneath them.
May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or night would fain destroy us. {#104:11}

The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their words oppose each other.
Of these two that which is the true and honest, Soma protects, and brings the false to nothing. {#104:12}

Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely claims the Warrior's title.
He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entangled in the noose of Indra. {#104:13}

As if I worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts about the Gods, O Agni.
Why art thou angry with us, Jātavedas? Destruction fall on those who lie against thee! {#104:14}

So may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life or if I be a demon.
Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue hath called me Yātudhāna. {#104:15}

May Indra slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of all creatures perish,
The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon though devoid of demon nature. {#104:16}

She too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body in her guile and malice,
May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones with loud ring destroy the demons. {#104:17}

Spread out, ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and grind the Rākṣasas to pieces,
Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, or sully and pollute our holy worship. {#104:18}

Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it, Maghavan, made keen by Soma.
Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the demons with thy rocky weapon. {#104:19}

They fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they harm indomitable Indra.
Śakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now, let him cast his bolt at fiendish wizards. {#104:20}

Indra hath ever been the fiends’ destroyer who spoil oblations of the Gods’ invokers:
Yea, Śakra, like an axe that splits the timber, attacks and smashes them like earthen vessels. {#104:21}

Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in the form of dog or cuckoo.
Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture as with a stone, O Indra, crush the demon. {#104:22}

Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn drive off the couples of Kimīdins.
Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble: from grief that comes from heaven mid-air preserve us. {#104:23}

Slay the male demon, Indra! slay the female, joying and triumphing in arts of magic.
Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no more the Sun when he arises. {#104:24}

Look each one hither, look around Indra and Soma, watch ye well. {#104:25}
