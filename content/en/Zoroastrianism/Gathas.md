  The Gathas are 17 Avestan hymns that are believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. This is in contrast to all other Zoroastrian texts, which are known to have been composed later. The Gathas form the core of the Zoroastrian liturgy, the Yasna, in which they are the oldest and most sacred sections. These hymns and a few others among the older sections of the Yasna are composed in Old (or "Gathic") Avestan language, whereas the rest of the Yasnas as well as other Zoroastrian texts are composed in younger Avestan.

  This translation is by L. H. Mills, and was published in 1887 as volume 31 of the Sacred Books of the East series edited by F. Max Müller.

# THE GĀTHAS.

## YASNA XXIX.

*THE WAIL OF THE KINE. THE CALL OF ZARATHUŚTRA. HIS PRAYER FOR AID.* [pg 6]

(Homage to you, O Sacred Gāthas!)

Unto you (O Ahura and Asha!) the Soul of the Kine (our sacred herds and folk) cried aloud: For whom did ye create me, and by whom did ye fashion me? On me comes the assault of wrath, and of violent power, the blow of desolation, audacious insolence, and (thievish) might. None other pasture-giver have I than you, therefore do ye teach me good (tillage) for the fields (my only hope of welfare)! {#29:1}

Ahura speaks.

Upon this the Creator of the Kine (the holy [pg 7] herds) asked of Righteousness: How (was) thy guardian for the Kine (appointed) by thee when, as having power (over all her fate), ye made her? (In what manner did ye secure) for her, together with pasture, a cattle-chief who was both skilled and likewise energetic? Whom did ye select as her (life's) master who might hurl back the fury of the wicked? {#29:2}

Asha answers.

To Him the (Divine Righteousness) answered with his sanctity. (Great was our perplexity); a chieftain who war capable of smiting back (their fury), and who was himself without hate (was not to be obtained by us); among such things as these, those things are not to be known (by beings such as we) which are the influences which approach (and move) the lofty fires (revealing the favour and the will of God). {#29:3}

Of beings He is the mightiest to whom those [pg 8] who have performed their actions approach with invocations. (He has no need to ask!)

Zarathuśtra intervenes.

The Great Creator (is himself) most mindful of the uttered indications which have been fulfilled beforehand hitherto in the deeds of demon-gods and (good or evil) men, and of those which shall be fulfilled by them hereafter. He Ahura is the discerning arbiter; so shall it be to us as He shall will! {#29:4}

Therefore it is that we both, my soul and (the soul) of the mother Kine, (are) making our supplications [pg 9] for the two worlds to Ahura, and with hands stretched out in entreaty, when (we pray to the Great Creator with questions in our doubt; (and He will answer). {#29:5}

Not for the righteous liver, not for the thrifty (tiller of the earth), shall there be destruction together with the wicked!

Ahura.

Upon this the Lord, the Great Creator, He who understands the mysterious grace by His insight, spake thus. Not in this manner is a spiritual master found for us, nor a chieftain moved by Righteousness and appointed (in its spirit); therefore Thee have I named (as such a head) to the diligent tiller of the ground! [pg 10] {#29:6}

The Ameshōspends.

Mazda has created the inspired Word-of-reason which is a Mãthra of fatness (for the offering), the (Divine) Righteousness consenting with Him in his deed. Food he has prepared for the Kine and for the eaters, He the one bountiful with his (saving) doctrine; but whom hast Thou, endowed with the Good Mind, who may give forth those (doctrines) by word of mouth to mortals? {#29:7}

Ahura.

This man is found for me here who alone has [pg 11] hearkened to our enunciations, Zarathuśtra Spitama! Our mighty and completed acts of grace he desires to enounce for us, for (Me), the Great Creator and for Righteousness; wherefore I will give him the good abode (and authoritative place) of such an one as speaks! {#29:8}

The Geuś Urvan.

Upon this the Soul of the Kine lamented (: Woe is unto me) since (I have obtained for myself) in my wounding a lord who is powerless to effect (his) wish, the (mere) voice of a feeble and pusillanimous man, whereas I desire one who is lord over his will (and able as one of royal state to bring what he desires to effect). {#29:9}

The Ameshōspends.

((Aye,) when shall he ever appear who may bring to her help strong-handed?) [pg 12] Zarathuśtra.

Do ye, O Ahura and thou, O Righteousness! grant gladness unto these (our disciples), and the sovereign Kingdom (of the Deity) such as (is established) in (His) Good Mind by which one bestows upon them the peaceful amenities of home and quiet happiness (as against the fearful ravages which they suffer), for of these, O Great Creator! I ever thought Thee first possessor! {#29:10}

And when shall the (Divine) Righteousness, the Good Mind (of the Lord, and His) Sovereign Power (come) hastening to me (to give me strength for my task and mission), O Great Creator, the Living Lord! (For without his I cannot advance [pg 13] or undertake my toil.) Do ye now therefore assign unto us your aid and in abundance for our great cause. May we be (partakers) of the bountiful grace of these your equals (your counsellors and servants)! [pg 14] {#29:11}

* * *

## YASNA XXVIII.

*PRAYERS CHIEFLY FOR GRACE AND FOR THE WORDS OF REVELATION.* [pg 17]

(A strengthening blessing is the thought, a blessing is the word, a blessing is the deed of the righteous Zarathuśtra. May the Bountiful Immortals accept and help on the chants. Homage to you, O sacred Gāthas!) {#28:1}

With venerating (desire) for this (gift) of gracious help, O Mazda, and stretching forth my hands (to Thee) I pray for the first (blessing) of (Thy) bountiful Spirit; (that is, I beseech of Thee that my) actions [pg 18] (toward) all (may be performed) in (the Divine) Righteousness; and with this I implore from Thee the understanding of Thy Benevolent Mind, in order that I may propitiate the Soul of the Kine (our herds and folk, which cries so bitterly to Thee). {#28:2}

And therefore, O Great Creator, the Living Lord! (inspired) by Thy Benevolent Mind, I approach You, (and beseech of Thee) to grant me (as a bountiful gift) for both the worlds, the corporeal and (for that) of mind, those attainments which are to be derived from the (Divine) Righteousness, and by means of which (that personified Righteousness within us) may introduce those who are its recipients into beatitude and glory! {#28:3}

O (thou Divine) Righteousness, and thou Benevolent [pg 19] Mind (of Deity)! I will worship you, and Ahura Mazda the first, for all of whom the Pious ready mind (within us) is causing the imperishable Kingdom to advance. (And while I thus utter my supplications to You), come Ye to my calls to help! {#28:4}

(Yea, I will approach You with my supplications, I) who am delivering up (my) mind and soul to that (heavenly) Mount (whither all the redeemed at last must pass), knowing (full well) the holy characteristics and rewards of the (ceremonial and moral) actions (prescribed) by Ahura Mazda. (And) [pg 20] so long as I am able and may have the power, so long will I teach (Your people concerning these holy deeds to be done by them with faith toward God, and) in the desire (for the coming) of the (Divine) Righteousness (within their souls). {#28:5}

And, thou Righteousness! when shall I see (thee, knowing the Good Mind (of God), and above all the personified) Obedience (of our lives which constitutes) the way to the most beneficent Ahura Mazda. (Asking this, I thus beseech thee, for) with this holy word of supplication we most hold off with tongue the flesh-devouring fiends, (the very sign and power of all spiritual foulness)! [pg 21] {#28:6}

And do Thou, O Lord, the Great Creator! come to me with Thy Good Mind; and do Thou, who bestowest gifts through Thy Righteousness, bestow alike long-lasting life on us. And (that this life may be spent aright, do) Thou by means of Thy lofty words (bestow) the (needed) powerful spiritual help upon Zarathuśtra and upon us, whereby we may overcome the torments of the tormentor. {#28:7}

(And) do thou, O (Divine) Righteousness, bestow (upon me) that sacred blessing which is constituted by the attainments of the Good Mind (within my soul); and do thou also, O Piety! grant unto [pg 22] Vīśtāspa and to me our wish; (yea) may’st Thou grant (us), O Mazda, ruler (as Thou art! that grace) whereby we may hear (with understanding) Thy benignant words. {#28:8}

That best (of gifts therefore) do I beseech (of Thee), O Thou best (of beings) Ahura! who art one in will with (Thy Divine) Righteousness (within us, likewise), the best (of spirits), desiring it (as I now do) for the (heroic) man Frashaośtra, and for me, upon whom also may’st Thou bestow it (not for time alone), but for all the ages of Thy Good Mind (that reign of Thy Benevolence which shall be to us as Heaven)! [pg 23] {#28:9}

And (impressed and moved) by these gifts of strengthening grace (which Thou may’st give in answer to these prayers) may we never anger You, O Ahura Mazda! (nor Thy) Righteousness (within us), nor yet Thy Kindly Mind (toward us), since we have most earnestly made effort (helping to advance Your cause) in the (chanted) offering of Your praisers, for most easy to be invoked (are Ye). (Yours are verily both) the desire for (spiritual) blessings (for us), and the (Divine) Possession (of their power). {#28:10}

And therefore do Thou, O Lord, the Great Creator! fill up and satisfy (my) desire with these attainments (of the grace) of Thy Good Mind, which Thou dost know to be derived from Righteousness, (and) which (are verily) sublime, for I have known [pg 24] Thine instructions to be never void of their effect (in the struggles) for our (daily) food, and therefore worthy objects of desire. {#28:11}

(Yea, I approach Thee with my prayers, I) who by these (great gifts of grace) will protect ((Thy) Divine Righteousness, and (Thy) Good Mind within us) for ever. And do Thou therefore, O Ahura Mazda! teach me from Thyself, yea, from Thine own mouth of spirit, that I may declare it forth to (these Thy waiting people) by what (powers and according to what laws) the primeval world arose! [pg 25] {#28:12}

* * *

## YASNA XXX.

*THE DOCTRINE OF DUALISM.* [pg 28]

And now I will proclaim, O ye who are drawing near and seeking to be taught! those animadversions which appertain to Him who knows (all things) whatsoever; the praises which are for Ahura, and the sacrifices (which spring) from the Good Mind, and likewise the benignant meditations inspired by Righteousness. And I pray that propitious results may be seen in the lights. [pg 29] {#30:1}

Hear ye then with your ears; see ye the bright flames with the (eyes of the) Better Mind. It is for a decision as to religions, man and man, each individually for himself. Before the great effort of the cause, awake ye (all) to our teaching! {#30:2}

Thus are the primeval spirits who as a pair (combining their opposite strivings), and (yet each) independent in his action, have been famed (of old). (They are) a better thing, they two, and a worse, as to thought, as to word, and as to deed. And between these two let the wisely acting choose aright. (Choose ye) not (as) the evil-doers! [pg 30] {#30:3}

(Yea) when the two spirits came together at the first to make life, and life's absence, and to determine how the world at the last shall be (ordered), for the wicked (Hell) the worst life, for the holy (Heaven) the Best Mental State, {#30:4}

(Then when they had finished each his part in the deeds of creation, they chose distinctly each his separate realm.) He who was the evil of them both (chose the evil), thereby working the worst of possible results, but the more bounteous spirit chose the [pg 31] (Divine) Righteousness; (yea, He so chose) who clothes upon Himself the firm stones of heaven (as His robe). And He chose likewise them who content Ahura with actions, which (are performed) really in accordance with the faith. {#30:5}

And between these two spirits the Demon-gods (and they who give them worship) can make no righteous choice, since we have beguiled them. As they were questioning and debating in their council the (personified) Worst Mind approached them that he might be chosen. (They made their [pg 32] fatal decision.) And thereupon they rushed together unto the Demon of Fury, that they might pollute the lives of mortals. {#30:6}

Upon this Āramaiti (the personified Piety of the saints) approached, and with her came the Sovereign Power, the Good Mind, and the Righteous Order. And (to the spiritual creations of good and of evil) Āramaiti gave a body, she the abiding and ever strenuous. And for these (Thy people) so let (that [pg 33] body) be (at the last), O Mazda! as it was when Thou camest first with creations! {#30:7}

And (when the great struggle shall have been fought out which began when the Daēvas first seized the Demon of Wrath as their ally), and when the (just) vengeance shall have come upon these wretches, then, O Mazda! the Kingdom shall have been gained for Thee by (Thy) Good Mind (within Thy folk). For to those, O living Lord! does (that Good Mind) utter his command, who will deliver the Demon of the Lie into the two hands of the Righteous Order (as a captive to a destroyer). {#30:8}

And may we be such as those who bring on [pg 34] this great renovation, and make this world progressive, (till its perfection shall have been reached). (As) the Ahuras of Mazda (even) may we be; (yea, like Thyself), in helpful readiness to meet (Thy people), presenting (benefits) in union with the Righteous Order. For there will our thoughts be (tending) where true wisdom shall abide in her home. {#30:9}

(And when perfection shall have been attained) then shall the blow of destruction fall upon the Demon of Falsehood, (and her adherents shall perish with her), but swiftest in the happy abode of the Good Mind and of Ahura the righteous saints [pg 35] shall gather, they who proceed in their walk (on earth) in good repute (and honour). {#30:10}

Wherefore, O ye men! ye are learning (thus) these religious incitations which Ahura gave in (our) happiness and (our) sorrow. (And ye are also learning) what is the long wounding for the wicked, and the blessings which are in store for the righteous. And when these (shall have begun their course), salvation shall be (your portion)! [pg 36] {#30:11}

* * *

## YASNA XXXI.

*THE PROGRESS AND STRUGGLES OF THE CAUSE.* [pg 40]

These doctrines (therefore) we are earnestly declaring to You as we recite them forth from memory, words (till now) unheard (with faith) by those who by means of the doctrinal vows of the harmful Lie are delivering the settlements of Righteousness to death, but words which are of the best unto those who are heartily devoted to Ahura. {#31:1}

And if by this means the indubitable truths are not seen in the soul, then as better (than these words) I will come to you all (in my person) with [pg 41] that power, and in that way according to which Ahura Mazda knows and appoints His ruler, that ruler over both the two (struggling) bands, in order that we (in obedience to him), may live according to Righteousness. {#31:2}

And that keenness, that deciding satisfaction, which Thou hast given by (Thy) Spirit, and (Thy) Fire, and by Thy Righteousness (itself) to the two battling (sides), do Thou declare unto us, O Ahura! that vow which is for the seeing (as those endowed with mental light). Yea, do Thou declare this that we may know it, O Mazda! With the tongue of Thy mouth do Thou speak it (that as I preach its mighty truths) I may make all the living believers! [pg 42] {#31:3}

And when the Divine Righteousness shall be inclined to my appeal, and with him all those (remaining ones who are as) Mazda's (own) Ahuras then with the blessedness (of the reward), with (my) Piety and with Thy Best Mind (active within me), I will pray for that mighty Kingdom by whose force we may smite the Lie-demon. {#31:4}

Aye, do Thou tell me that I may discern it, since through (Thy) Righteous Order the better (lot) is given; tell me this that I may know it with (Thy) Good Mind (as it speaks within me), and that I may ponder that to which these my truths belong (and [pg 43] of which my prophet speaks; yea), tell me those things, O Mazda Ahura! which may not be, and which may be. {#31:5}

And that verily shall be the best of all words to Him which the All-(wise one) will declare to me in very deed, that word which is the Mãthra of Welfare and of Immortality (for it proclaims His beneficent power). And to the Great Creator (shall there be) a Realm such as that (whose strength I asked for victory), and which (at the last) shall flourish in its holiness to His (glory)! {#31:6}

(For He has sovereign control.) He who conceived of these (truths of the Mãthra) as their first (inspirer), (and as He thought their existence they [pg 44] (all) as (His) glorious (conceptions first) clothed themselves in the stars), He is through His understanding the Creator of the Righteous Order. And thus likewise He supports His Beneficent Mind (in His saints). And these (holy creatures) may’st Thou cause to prosper by Thy Spirit (since they are Thine own), O Ahura Mazda! Thou who art for every hour the same! {#31:7}

Therefore, as the first did I conceive of Thee, O Ahura Mazda! as the one to be adored with the mind in the creation, as the Father of the Good Mind within us, when I beheld Thee with my (enlightened) eyes as the veritable maker of our Righteousness, as the Lord of the actions of life! {#31:8}

Thine, O Ahura! was Piety; yea, Thine, O Creator of the Kine! was understanding and the [pg 45] Spirit, when Thou didst order a path for her (guiding). From the earth's tiller (aided) she goeth (in that allotted way), or from him who was never tiller. (Thy path hath given her choice.) {#31:9}

(But she did not pause in temptation.) Of the two she chose the husbandman, the thrifty toiler in the fields, as a holy master endowed with the Good Mind's wealth. Never, Mazda! shall [pg 46] the thieving nomad share the good creed. (For the Kine's choice would bestow it!) {#31:10}

(And this doctrine was the first of rules to regulate our actions. Yet the opposer speaks beside Thee.) For when first, O Ahura Mazda! Thou didst create the (holy) settlements, and didst reveal the religious laws; and when Thou gavest (us) understanding from Thine own mind, and madest our (full) bodily life, and (didst thus determine) actions (by Thy power), and didst moreover deliver to us (nearer) injunctions whereby (as by a rule) the wisher may place his choices, {#31:11}

(There strife at once arose, and still is raging.) There (beside Thy prophet) the truthful or liar, the enlightened or unenlightened, lifts his voice (to utter [pg 47] his faith), and with devoted mind and heart. (But without hindrance from this striving, or pausing with feeble search, our) Piety steadily questions the two spirits (not here on earth) but (there in the spirit-world) where (they dwell as) in their home. {#31:12}

(Yea, my Piety questions searchingly, for Thou, O Maker! hast Thy view on all; we cannot question lightly.) What questions are asked which are open (permitted to our thoughts), or what questions (are asked) which are furtive (hiding themselves from the light), or (what decision soever we may make, and the man) who for the smallest sin binds on the heaviest penance, on all with Thy glittering eye(s) as a righteous guard Thou art gazing! [pg 48] {#31:13}

This then I will ask Thee, O Ahura Mazda! (as I seek Thy counsel once again). What events are coming now, and what events shall come in the future; and what prayers with debt-confessions are offered with the offerings of the holy? And what (are the awards) for the wicked? And how shall they be in the (final) state of completion? {#31:14}

And I would ask Thee this, O Mazda! (concerning the coadjutor of the wicked): What is the award for him who prepares the throne for the evil, for the evil-doer, O Ahura! for him who cannot else reclaim his life, not else save with lawless [pg 49] harm to the tiller's herd, to the pious husbandman's flock, who speaks no word with lying, (who abjures the Lie-demon's faith)? {#31:15}

Yea, I would ask Thee such a thing as this: How such an one as he who, with wise action, has striven to promote (Thy holy) Rule over house, and region, and province, in the Righteous Order and in truth, how he may become like Thee, O Great Creator, Living Lord? And when he may so become, (this also I would ask), and in what actions living he may so be? {#31:16}

And which of the (religions) is the greater (and the more prevailing as to these questions which thus concern the soul?) Is it that which the [pg 50] righteous believes, or the wicked? (Let then our questionings cease.) Let the enlightened (alone) speak to the enlightened. Let not the ignorant (further) deceive us, (high though he may lift his voice). Do Thou thyself, O Ahura Mazda! declare to us (the truth) as Thy Good Mind's full revealer. {#31:17}

(And you, ye assembled throngs!) let not a man of you lend a hearing to Mãthra, or to command of that sinner (ignorant as he is), for home, village, region, and province he would deliver to ruin and death. But (fly ye to arms without hearing), and hew ye them all with the halberd! [pg 51] {#31:18}

Let them hear Him who conceived of the Righteous Order for the worlds, the (all)-wise One, O Ahura! For truthful speech He rules with absolute sway over words, and ever free of tongue (to guide us in our way). By Thy shining flame (He doth guide us, Thine altar's flame with its signs of decision and of grace) sent forth for the good of the strivers. {#31:19}

(But, O ye listening men!) he who renders [pg 52] the saint deceived, for him shall be later destruction. Long life shall be his lot in the darkness; foul shall be his food; his speech shall be of the lowest. And this, which is such a life as your own, O ye vile! your (perverted) conscience through your own deeds will bring you! {#31:20}

But Ahura Mazda will give both Universal Weal and Immortality in the fulness of His Righteous Order, and from himself as the head of Dominion (within His saints). And He will likewise give the Good Mind's vigorous might to him who in spirit and deeds is His friend, (and with faith fulfils his vows) [pg 53] {#31:21}

And to the wise are these things clear as to the one discerning with his mind (not blinded by the perverter). With Thy Good Mind and Thy (holy) Kingdom he follows the Righteous Order both in his words and his actions. And to Thee, O Ahura Mazda! such a man shall be the most helpful and vigorous being (for he serves with every power)! [pg 54] {#31:22}

* * *

## YASNA XXXII.

*THE STRUGGLE IS CONTINUED IN THE MIDST OF REVERSES.* [pg 56]

(That rival-monarch (thus we may supply the sense of lost verses) for whom some are plotting to secure the sovereignty, and who, once in power, would deliver over home, village, town, and province to ruin and to death, is active in his efforts, and offering [pg 57] the devotions of his false religion to accomplish his ends.)

His lord-kinsman will pray (as I Zarathuśtra prayed), and his labouring villagers, with his (trusted) peers, and his (fellow) Daēva-worshippers. But in my mind is the friendship of Ahura Mazda, the Great Creator, the living Lord; and Thine heralds, O Ahura! may we be; may we hold back those who hate and who offend You! {#32:1}

To these (for whom the prophet spake) Ahura Mazda answered, ruling as He does through His Good Mind (within their souls), He replied from His Sovereign Power, our good friend (as he is) through His surpassing Righteousness: We have accepted [pg 58] your good and bountiful Piety, and we have chosen her; ours shall she be! {#32:2}

But you, O ye Daēvas! are all a seed from the Evil Mind. He who offers sacrifice to You the most is of the Lie-demon, and (he is a child) of perversion. In advance (are your) deceits whereby ye are famed in the sevenfold earth! {#32:3}

For ye (are) confusing our thoughts, whereby men, giving forth the worst deeds, will speak, as of [pg 59] the Demon-gods beloved, forsaken by the Good Mind, (far) astray from the understanding of the Great Creator, the Living Lord, and (far astray) from His Righteousness! {#32:4}

Therefore ye would beguile mankind of happy life (upon earth) and of Immortality (beyond it), since the Evil Spirit (has ruled) you with his evil mind. Yea, he has ruled you, (ye) who are of the Demon-gods, and with an evil word unto action, as his ruler (governs) the wicked! [pg 60] {#32:5}

Full of crime (your leader) has desired to destroy us, wherefore he is famed, (and his doctrine is declared); but if this be so of these, then in the same manner, O Ahura! Thou possessest (because Thou knowest) the true (teachings) in Thy memory. And in Thy kingdom and Thy Righteous Order I will establish Thy precepts (in Thy name). {#32:6}

Among these wretched beings (this their leader) knows not that those things which are declared [pg 61] as victorious (by his allies) are bound together for the smiting; yea, those things by which he was famed (as victorious) by his (blade of) glittering iron. But the utter destruction of those things Thou, O Ahura Mazda! knowest, most surely! {#32:7}

Of these wretched beings Yima Vīvanghusha was famed to be; he who, desiring to content our men, was eating kine's flesh in its pieces. But from (such as) these, O Ahura Mazda! in Thy discerning discrimination, am I (to be seen as distinct). [pg 62] {#32:8}

An evil teacher (as that leader is), he will destroy (our) doctrines, and by his teachings he will pervert the (true) understanding of life, seizing away (from me) my riches, the choice and real wealth of (Thy) Good Mind. To You and to Asha, O Ahura Mazda! am I therefore crying with the voice of my spirit's (need)! {#32:9}

Aye, this man will destroy my doctrines (indeed, for he blasphemes the highest of creatures that live or are made). He declares that the (sacred) Kine and the Sun are the worst of things which eye can see; and he will offer the gifts of the wicked (as priest to their Demon-gods). And at the last he will parch our meadows with drought, and will hurl his mace at Thy saint (who may fall before his arms). [pg 63] {#32:10}

Yea, these will destroy my life, for they consult with the great of the wicked (enlightening themselves by their words). And they are seizing away the gifts of inherited treasures from both household-lord and from house-wife; (wretched men that they are), and those who will fiercely wound (my folk, repelled and in no way kindly moved) by the better mind of the holy. {#32:11}

(But Ahura will speak His rebuke, for) as to those doctrines which (such) men may be (basely) delivering (repelled) by the holiest action, (and galled by its sacred truth) God hath said: Evil (are they! Yea, unto these He hath said it) who have slain the Kine's life by a blessing (and have cursed her while they offered to help her), men by whom Grehmas are loved above Righteousness, and the Karpans, [pg 64] and the Throne of those who have wished for the Demon of lies (as their deity and friend). {#32:12}

And the Grehma will seek for these things by means of his (evil) kingdom in the abode of (Hell which is) the Worst Mind (who both are together) the destroyers of life, and who, O Mazda! will bewail with glad but (envious) wish the message of Thy prophet. (But he will not abate with his vengeance), he will hold them afar from the sight of the truth! {#32:13}

His is Grehma; aye, his! And to (oppose) Thee he will establish the Kavis and (their) scheming [pg 65] plans. Their deeds of power are but deceits since they have come as an aid to the wicked, and since he has been (falsely) said (to be set) to conquer the Kine, he who shall kindle that (very) help of grace which removes our death afar, (and lightens Thy saving flame). {#32:14}

And therefore will I drive from hence the Karpans’ and Kavis’ disciples. And after these (have thus been driven hence and away) then these (my princely aiding saints) whom they (now) render no longer rulers at will over life, (and deprive of their absolute power), these shall be borne (at [pg 66] last) by the (immortal) two to the home of (Thy) Good Mind (in Heaven)! {#32:15}

(And) this entire (reward of the righteous) is from that Best One who teaches in the wide (mental) light of the pious, ruling (as supreme), O Mazda Ahura! whose are my woes and my [pg 67] doubtings (yea, they lie in His power to heal), when I shall make (my prophets) men to be sought for the harm of the wicked. And this I shall do by the word of my mouth (to defend and avenge my saints)! [pg 68] {#32:16}

## YASNA XXXIII.

*PRAYERS, HOPES, AND SELF-CONSECRATION.* [pg 72]

As by the laws of the primeval world, so will our spiritual chieftain act (that chief besought-for by the Kine, and named as Zarathuśtra by the Lord). Deeds most just he will do toward the wicked, as toward the righteous, and toward him whose deeds of fraud and righteous deeds combine (in equal measure). {#33:1}

Yea, (he will act with justice but with vengeance, for) he who does evil to the wicked by word, or with thought (and plan), and (who therein does not dally, but toils labouring as) with both the hands, or he (again) who admonishes one for his good, such as these are offering (a gift) to their religious faith in the love (and with the approving view) of Ahura Mazda; (they are offering to conscience.) [pg 73] {#33:2}

(And so may it be), O Ahura! Let the man who is the best toward the righteous saint, whether lord's kinsman, or as village labourer, with the allied peer (of the master), having light, and endowed with energy for the cattle (a Ratu such as Ahura sought to satisfy their wail), let such an one be (for us) in the work-field of the Righteous Order, in the pastures of Thy Good Mind. {#33:3}

(And I beseech for Thine instruction), I who will abjure all disobedience (toward Thee, praying that others likewise may withhold it) from Thee; I who abjure the Evil Mind as well, the lordly kinsman's arrogance, and that lying sin which is (alas!) the next thing to the people (their most familiar fault), and the blaming ally's falsehood, and from the Kine the worst care of her meadows (the crime of stint in labour), [pg 74] {#33:4}

I, who (abjuring these sins), call earnestly on Thine Obedience of all (assisting guardians) the greatest one for our help, gaining (thereby) long life in the Realm of (Thy) Good Mind (incarnate in our tribes), and paths that are straight from their Righteous Order, wherein Ahura Mazda dwells, {#33:5}

(Yea), I who, as this Thy faithful priest, invoke Thee through (my) Righteousness, (now) seek with longing from (Thy) Best Spirit, and with that (best) intention of mind, (to know) what he himself thought of the working of (our) fields. Therefore (because I abjure the Evil Mind, and all disobedience, [pg 75] arrogance, falsehood), O Mazda! would I beseech of Thee for a sight of Thee, and for consultation with Thee! (What is Thy will and mind?) {#33:6}

Come Ye, then, to my best (regulations. Come to my men, and my laws), my very own, O Mazda! and let them see through the Righteous Order and (Thy) Good Mind (which Thou wilt bestow in Thy drawing near) how I am heard before the rich giver (in the assembly of Thy worshippers). Yea, (come Ye); and let the manifold offerings of worship be manifest among us. (Arouse Ye, and help our zeal!) [pg 76] {#33:7}

(Come Ye) and show me the worthy aims of our faith, so that I may approach and fulfil them with (Thy) Good Mind, the offering, O Mazda! of the One like You, or the words of praises offered with Righteousness. And give Ye as Your offering (of grace to me) the abiding gifts of Your Immortality and Welfare! {#33:8}

And let (one like those), O Mazda! bear on to Thee the spirit of the two leaders who cause the holy ritual Truth to flourish; let him bear them to (Thy) brilliant home with preternatural insight, and with the Better Mind. Yea, let him bear that spirit on as a fellow-help in (furthering) the [pg 77] readiness of those (in their holy work) whose souls go hand in hand. {#33:9}

(And not for these alone do I pray, but for us as well.) All prosperous states in being which have been enjoyed in the past, which men are now enjoying, and which shall be known in the future, do Thou grant (me) these in Thy love. (Yea), cause (our) bodily and personal life to be blest with salvation through (Thy) Good Mind, (Thy) Sovereign Power, and (Thy) Sanctity. {#33:10}

And, O Thou who art the most beneficent Ahura Mazda! and thou who art Āramaiti (our piety), and also the Righteous Order who dost further on the settlements; and Thou, the Good Mind, and the Sovereign Power! hear ye me all, and have mercy for every deed which I do whatsoever! [pg 78] {#33:11}

And Thou, O Ahura! do Thou (Thyself) arise to me! Through Āramaiti give me power, O most bountiful Spirit Mazda! through (my) faithful appeals and offerings; and for (my) Righteousness grant me mighty strength, and (Thy) thrift-law through (Thy) Good Mind. {#33:12}

(Arise to give me power), and then for grace in a wide perception (that I may view its depth and extent), do Thou reveal to me Thy nature (?), O Ahura! (the power of Thine attributes), and those of Thy (holy) kingdom, and by these, the blessed gifts of (Thy) Good Mind! And do Thou, O bountiful Piety show forth the religious truths through (Thy) Righteous Order. [pg 79] {#33:13}

Thus, as an offering, Zarathuśtra gives the life of his very body. And he offers, likewise, O Mazda! the priority of the Good Mind, (his eminence gained) by his holiness (with Thy folk); and he offers (above all his) Obedience (to Thee) in deed and in speech, and with these (Thine established) Sovereign Power! [pg 80] {#33:14}

* * *

## YASNA XXXIV. [pg 83]

As to those (three gifts of blessings), Immortality, the Righteous Order, and the (established) Kingdom of Welfare, which Thou, O Mazda! hast given through (holy) deeds, words, and the sacrifice unto these (Thy servants here in my sight), gifts (shall) be offered by us in return to Thee, O Ahura! and with the foremost of them all. {#34:1}

Yea, and all those gifts of the Good Spirit have been given (back in gratitude) to Thee by the mind and the deed of the bountiful man, whose soul goes hand in hand with the Righteous Order in the settlement, in homage toward the One like You, [pg 84] O Mazda! and with the chants of the (thankful) praisers. {#34:2}

And unto Thee, O Ahura! will we offer the (thankful) meat-offering with self-humbling praise, and to Thy Righteousness (like Thee a person), and for all the settlements in Thy kingdom which are guarded by Thy Good Mind. For in the perfect preparation of the justly acting (has that offering its power), O Mazda! together with all (others of its kind). Among those like You and worthy of Yourselves, it is a blessing. {#34:3}

And we pray likewise for Thy Fire, O Ahura! strong through Righteousness (as it is), most swift, (most) powerful, to the house with joy receiving it, in many wonderful ways our help, but to the hater, O Mazda! it is a steadfast harm as if with weapons hurled from the hands. [pg 85] {#34:4}

What is then Your Kingdom, O Mazda? What are Your riches? that I may become Your own in my actions, with the Righteous Order, and (Thy) Good Mind, to care for Your poor (in their suffering). Apart from all would we declare You, yea, apart from Daēvas, and Khrafstra-polluted mortals! [pg 86] {#34:5}

If thus Ye are in verity, O Mazda! with the Righteous Order and Thy Good Mind, then grant Ye me a sign of this in this world's entire abiding (while I live amid its scenes), how offering sacrifice and praising You the more devoutly, I may approach You (in my worship)! {#34:6}

Where are Thine offerers, O Mazda! Thy helpers, who as the enlightened of the Good Mind are producing the doctrines with wide mental light as inherited treasures, (delivering them as Thy word) in misfortune and in woe? I know none other than You; then do Ye save us through Your righteousness! {#34:7}

Through these our deeds (of sacrifice and zeal), they are terrified among whom there was (once) destruction, and for many (at the time) when the [pg 87] oppressor of Thy holy vows was as the stronger oppressing the weaker. They who have not thought (in consonance) with Thy Righteous Order, from these Thy Good Mind abideth afar. {#34:8}

Aye, they who desert Thy bountiful Piety, O Mazda! that one desired of Thee, O Thou omniscient! and who thus abandon her by reason of the evil-doer, and in their ignorance of (Thy) Good Mind, from such as these (Āramaiti) with her holiness utterly departs as the red Khrafstras (who destroy and pollute all life, flee) from us (Thy faithful servants). {#34:9}

Through the action of this (His) Good Mind (as he works his grace within us) the benevolently wise One declared a result as its fruit, He knowing the bountiful Piety, the creatrix of righteous beings. These all, O Mazda Ahura! in Thy Kingdom (are [pg 88] 'helps to our progress') for they smite (our tyrants) with fear. {#34:10}

And for Thee hath Āramaiti (who is Our Piety) increased both the Universal Weal and (its continuance in) Immortality, and (with them as ever united) the Righteous (ritual and moral) Order (established and made firm) in the Kingdom of (Thy Good Mind). Those powerful lasting two (hath she increased) to (give us the needful) food. And through these, O Mazda! art Thou with Thy perfect expellers of hate. (Thou removest Thy foes afar!) {#34:11}

What then are Thy regulations? And what wilt Thou? What of praise, or of (fuller) offering? Speak forth that we hear it, O Mazda! what will establish the blessed rewards of Thine ordinance! [pg 89] Teach Thou us the paths through Righteousness, those verily trod by (Thy) Good Mind as he lives within Thy saints. {#34:12}

(Do I ask what is that path?) That way which Thou declarest to me as the path of the Good Mind, O Ahura! (is made in its parts by) the religious precepts and laws of the Saviours, wherein the well-doer thrives from (his) Righteousness. And it marks for the good a reward of which Thou art Thyself the bestower. {#34:13}

For that (reward), O Mazda! ye have given as the one to be chosen for (our) bodily life through [pg 90] the deeds of Thy Good Mind (in us). They who work in the toil of the mother. Kine, these further Your merciful care through the understanding's action, and (taught) by Thine Order's (word). {#34:14}

Yea, (show me, O Mazda! that path and its reward); tell me the best (of truths); reveal the best words and best actions, and the confessing prayer of the praiser through Thy Good Mind (living within us); and through the Righteous Order, O Ahura! And by Your Sovereign Power and grace may’st Thou make life really progressive (till perfection shall have been reached)! [pg 91] {#34:15}

## YASNA XLIII.

*SALVATION IS ANNOUNCED AS UNIVERSAL FOR BELIEVERS. REFLECTIONS OF ZARATHUŚTRA UPON THE SUBLIMITY AND BOUNTIFULNESS OF AHURA.* [pg 97]

[pg 98]

Salvation to this man, salvation to him whosoever (he may be)! Let the absolutely ruling Great Creator grant (us, He) the living Lord, the two eternal powers. Yea, verily, I ask it of Thee (O Ahura) for the maintaining Righteousness. And may’st Thou also give it to me, (O inspiring) Piety! splendour (as it is), holy blessings, the Good Mind's life. {#43:1}

Yea, to this one may the man endowed with [pg 99] glory give that best of all things, the (spiritual) glory. And do Thou likewise (Thyself) reveal Thine own (gifts) through Thy most bountiful spirit, O Mazda! (And do Thou teach us) Thy wonderful thoughts of wisdom, those of Thy Good Mind, which Thou hast revealed (to us) by Thy Righteousness (within us) with the happy increase of (our joy), and on a long life's every day. {#43:2}

And may that (holy man) approach toward that which is the better than the good, he who will show to us the straight paths of (spiritual) profit, (the blessings) of this corporeal life, and of that the mental, in those veritably real (eternal) worlds, where dwells Ahura; (that holy man) an offerer of Thine, O Mazda! a faithful citizen, and bountiful of (mind). [pg 100] {#43:3}

Yea, I will regard Thee as mighty and likewise bountiful, O Ahura Mazda! when (I behold) those aids of grace (approach me), aids which Thou dost guard and nurture as (Thy) just awards to the wicked (to hold him far from us), as well as to the righteous (for our help), Thy Fire's flame therewith so strong through the Holy Order, and when to me the Good Mind's power comes + {#43:4}

(For) so I conceived of Thee as bountiful, O Great Giver, Mazda! when I beheld Thee as supreme in the generation of life, when, as rewarding deeds and words, Thou didst establish evil for the evil, and happy blessings for the good, by Thy (great) virtue (to be adjudged to each) in the creation's final change. {#43:5}

In which (last) changing Thou shalt come, and with Thy bounteous spirit, and Thy sovereign power, [pg 101] O Ahura Mazda! by deeds of whom the settlements are furthered through the Righteous Order. And saving regulations likewise unto these shall Āramaiti utter, (she, our Piety within us), yea, (laws) of Thine understanding which no man may deceive. {#43:6}

Yea, I conceived of Thee as bountiful, O Great Giver Mazda! when he (Thy messenger, Obedience) drew near me, and asked me thus: Who art thou? And whose is thine allegiance? And how to-day shall I show the signs that give the light on this (our) question, (signs) as to the lands (from whence thou camest) and in thyself? {#43:7}

Then to him I, Zarathuśtra, as my first answer, said: To the wicked (would that I could be) in very truth a strong tormentor and avenger, but to the [pg 102] righteous may I be a mighty help and joy, since to preparations for Thy Kingdom, and in desire (for its approach), I would devote myself so long as to Thee, O Mazda! I may praise, and weave my song. {#43:8}

Yea, I conceived of Thee as bountiful, O Ahura Mazda! when (Thine herald) with Thy Good Mind near approached me, and asked me thus: For what dost thou desire that thou may’st gain, and that thou may’st know it? Then for Thy Fire an offering of praise and holiness (I desired. And on that offering for myself) as long as I have the power, will I meditate, (and for its holy power among Thy people will I plan). {#43:9}

And may’st Thou likewise grant me (Thy) Righteousness (within me), since I earnestly invoke that perfect readiness (of mind), joining in my prayer with Āramaiti (our Piety toward Thee. Yea, pray Thou Thyself within me through these holy powers). Ask Thou (Thyself) our questions, those which shall be asked by us of Thee; for a question asked by [pg 103] Thee (as its inspirer), is as the question of the mighty, whene’er Thy (?) ruler speaks his potent wish. {#43:10}

II. Yea, I conceived of Thee as bountiful, O Ahura Mazda! when (Thy messenger) with Thy Good Mind near approached me, and with your words I first impressed (my soul). Woes then 'midst men Thy heart-devoted one declared (to be) my (portion); but that will I do which Thou did’st say was best.

And since Thou, coming thus, Thy legal Righteousness in fulness spakest, then declare not to me words as yet unheard (with faith or knowledge; command me not) to go forth (with these upon my task) before Thy Sraosha (Obedience) comes to me, to go on hand in hand with me with holy recompense and mighty splendour, whereby to [pg 104] give the contending throngs(?), as a blessing, (Your) spiritual gifts (of certainty and peace). {#43:12}

Thus I conceived of Thee as bounteous, O Ahura Mazda! when with Thy Good Mind (Sraosha, Obedience) approached me. (And I would therefore pray thus of Thee, that bounteous one.) In order that I may make known to men the true and sacred aims of their desires (in the rite or daily toil), grant Ye me long life for this, (that blessing) which none with daring may extort from You, even this (gift) of that desired place which has been declared to be within Thy Realm. {#43:13}

Yea, as the man enlightened (in Thy law), and who has possessions, gives to his friend, (so give Ye) me, O Great Creator! Thy rejoicing and [pg 105] abounding grace, when through Thy sovereign Power, and from (the motives of Thy cause of) Righteous Order, I stand forth to go out to, or to arouse, the chiefs of Thy (pure) proclamation, with all those (others) who recite Thy well-remembered Mãthra word. {#43:14}

Yea, I conceived of Thee as bounteous, O Ahura Mazda! when with the Good Mind's grace Thy Sraosha (Obedience) approached me, (and said): Let the quiet and long-enduring better mind with understanding teach (thee); let not a foremost man [pg 106] conciliate the wicked (as sycophant desiring aid), for with that (quiet mind of faith), Thy saints have brought full many a sinner unto Thee (as convert, and in penitence). {#43:15}

Thus, O Ahura Mazda! this Zarathuśtra loves the Spirit, and every man most bounteous prays (beside him): Be Righteousness life-strong, and clothed with body. In that (holy) Realm which shines (with splendour) as the sun, let Piety be present; and may she through the indwelling of Thy Good Mind give us blessings in reward for deeds! [pg 107] {#43:16}

## YASNA XLIV.

*QUESTIONS ASKED OF AHURA WITH THANKFULNESS AND DEVOTION.* [pg 111]

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; when praise is to be offered, how (shall I complete) the praise of the One like You, O Mazda? Let [pg 112] the One like Thee declare it earnestly to the friend who is such as I, thus through Thy Righteousness (within us) to offer friendly help to us, so that the One like Thee may draw near us through Thy Good Mind (within the soul). {#44:1}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, how, in pleasing Him, may we serve the supreme one of (Heaven) the better world; yea, how to serve that chief who may grant us those (blessings of His grace, and) who will seek for (grateful requitals at our hands); for He, bountiful (as He is) through the Righteous Order, (will hold off) ruin from (us) all, guardian (as He is) for both the worlds, O Spirit Mazda! and a friend. [pg 113] {#44:2}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright: Who by generation was the first father of the Righteous Order (within the world)? Who gave the (recurring) sun and stars their (undeviating) way? Who established that whereby the moon waxes, and whereby she wanes, save Thee? These things, O Great Creator! would I know, and others likewise still. {#44:3}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, who from beneath hath sustained the earth and the clouds above that they do not fall? Who made the waters and the plants? Who to the wind has yoked on the storm-clouds, the swift and fleetest two? Who, O Great Creator! is the inspirer of the good thoughts (within our souls)? [pg 114] {#44:4}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; who, as a skilful artisan, hath made the lights and the darkness? Who, as thus skilful, hath made sleep and the zest (of waking hours)? Who (spread) the Auroras, the noontides and midnight, monitors to discerning (man), duty's true (guides)? {#44:5}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright these things which I shall speak forth, if they are truly thus. Doth the Piety (which we cherish) in reality increase the sacred orderliness within our actions? To these Thy true saints hath she given the Realm through the Good Mind. For whom hast Thou made the Mother-kine, the producer of joy? {#44:6}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; who fashioned Āramaiti (our piety) the beloved, together with Thy Sovereign Power? Who, through his guiding wisdom, hath made the son revering the father? (Who made him beloved?) With (questions [pg 115] such as) these, so abundant, O Mazda! I press Thee, O bountiful Spirit, (Thou) maker of all! {#44:7}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, that I may ponder these which are Thy revelations, O Mazda! and the words which were asked (of Thee) by Thy Good Mind (within us), and that whereby we may attain, through Thine Order, to this life's perfection. Yea, how may my soul with joyfulness increase in goodness? Let it thus be. {#44:8}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, how to myself shall I hallow the Faith of Thy people, [pg 116] which the beneficent kingdom's lord hath taught me, even the admonitions which He called Thine equal, hath taught me through His lofty (and most righteous Sovereignty and) Power, as He dwells in like abode with Thine Order and Thy Good Mind? {#44:9}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright that holy Faith which is of all things best, and which, going on hand in hand with Thy people, shall further my lands in Asha, Thine order, and, through the words of Āramaiti (our piety), shall render actions just. The prayers of mine understanding will seek for Thee, O Ahura! {#44:10}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; how to these your (worshippers) may (that Piety once again and evermore) approach, to them to whom O Lord, Thy Faith is uttered? Yea, I beseech of Thee to tell me this, I who am known to Thee as Thy foremost of (servants); all other (Gods, with their [pg 117] polluted worshippers), I look upon with (my) spirit's hate. {#44:11}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; who is the righteous one in that regard in which I ask Thee my question? And who is evil? For which is the wicked? Or which is himself the (foremost) wicked one? And the vile man who stands against me (in this gain of) Thy blessing, wherefore is he not held and believed to be the sinner that he is? {#44:12}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, how shall I banish this Demon-of-the-Lie from us hence to those beneath who are filled with rebellion? The friends of Righteousness (as it lives in Thy saints) gain no light (from their teachings), nor have they loved the questions which Thy Good Mind (asks in the soul)! [pg 118] {#44:13}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; how shall I deliver that Demon-of-the-Lie into the two hands of Thine Order (as he lives in our hosts) to cast her down to death through Thy Mãthras of doctrine, and to send mighty destruction among her evil believers, to keep those deceitful and harsh oppressors from reaching their (fell) aims? {#44:14}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright. If through Thy Righteousness (within our souls) Thou hast the power over this for my protection, when the two hosts shall meet in hate (as they strive) for those vows which Thou dost desire to maintain, how, O Mazda! and to which of both wilt Thou give the day? {#44:15}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright, [pg 119] who smites with victory in the protection (of all) who exist, and for the sake of, and by means of Thy doctrine? Yea, clearly reveal a lord having power (to save us) for both lives. Then let (our) Obedience with Thy Good Mind draw near to that (leader), O Mazda! yea, to him to whomsoever Thou (shalt) wish that he should come. {#44:16}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; how, O Mazda! shall I proceed to that (great) conference with You, to that consummation of Your own, when my spoken wish shall be (effected) unto me, (the desire) to be in the chieftainship (and supported) by (the hope of) Weal and Immortality (those saving powers of Thy grace), and by that (holy) Mãthra (Thy word of thought) which fully guides our way through Righteousness (within). [pg 120] {#44:17}

(And, having gained Thine audience and Thine Order's sacred chieftainship), then I ask of Thee, O Ahura! and tell me aright, how shall I acquire that Thy Righteous Order's prize, ten (costly) mares male-mated, and with them the camel (those signs of honour and blessing for Thy chief. I ask Thee for these gifts for sacrifice). For it was told me for the sake of our Welfare (in our salvation), and of our Immortality, in what manner Thou shalt give to these (Thy conquering hosts) both of these Thy (gifts of grace). {#44:18}

This I ask Thee, O Ahura! tell me aright; (in the case of the recreant, of him) who does not give this (honoured) gift to him who hath earned it; yea, who does not give it to this (veracious tiller of the earth, to him who in no respect shows favour to the Demon-of-the-Lie, even to the) correct speaker (of Thy sacrificial word), what shall be his sentence at [pg 121] the first (now at this time, and because of this false dealing? I ask it), knowing well his doom at last {#44:19}

(And how as to our deluded foes?) Have Daēva-(worshippers) e’er reigned as worthy kings? (This verily I ask of Thee, the Daēva-worshippers) who fight for these (who act amiss? Have they well reigned) by whom the Karpan and the Usij(k) gave the (sacred) Kine to Rapine, whence, too, the Kavian in persistent strength has flourished? (And these have also never given us tribal wealth nor blessings), nor for the Kine have they brought waters to the fields for the sake of the Righteous Order (in our hosts), to further on their growth (and welfare)!

*THE DOCTRINE OF DUALISM. HOMAGE TO AHURA.* [pg 125]

Yea, I will speak forth; hear ye; now listen, ye who from near, and ye who from afar have come seeking (the knowledge). Now ponder ye clearly all (that concerns) him. Not for a second time shall the false teacher slay our life (of the mind, or the body). The wicked is hemmed in with his faith and his tongue! {#45:1}

Yea, I will declare the world's two first spirits, of whom the more bountiful thus spake to the harmful: Neither our thoughts, nor commands, nor our [pg 126] understandings, nor our beliefs, nor our deeds, nor our consciences, nor our souls, are at one. {#45:2}

Thus I will declare this world's first (teaching), that which the all-wise Mazda Ahura hath told me. And they among you who will not so fulfil and obey this Mãthra, as I now shall conceive and declare it, to these shall the end of life (issue) in woe. {#45:3}

Thus I will declare forth this world's best (being). From (the insight of His) Righteousness Mazda, who hath appointed these (things), hath known (what He utters to be true; yea, I will declare) Him the father of the toiling Good Mind (within us). So is His [pg 127] daughter through good deeds (our) Piety. Not to be deceived is the all-viewing Lord. {#45:4}

Yea, thus I will declare that which the most bountiful One told me, that word which is the best to be heeded by mortals. They who therein grant me obedient attention, upon them cometh Weal to bless, and the Immortal being, and in the deeds of His Good Mind cometh the Lord. {#45:5}

Aye, thus I will declare forth Him who is of all the greatest, praising through my Righteousness, I who do aright, those who (dispose of all as well aright). Let Ahura Mazda hear with His bounteous spirit, in whose homage (what I asked) was asked with the Good Mind. Aye, let Him exhort me through His wisdom (which is ever) the best. {#45:6}

(Yea, I will declare Him) whose blessings the offerers will seek for, those who are living now, as well as those who have lived (aforetime), as will they [pg 128] also who are coming (hereafter. Yea, even) the soul(s) of the righteous (will desire) them in the eternal Immortality. (Those things they will desire which are blessings to the righteous) but woes to the wicked. And these hath Ahura Mazda (established) through His kingdom, He, the creator (of all). {#45:7}

Him in our hymns of homage and of praise would I faithfully serve, for now with (mine) eye, I see Him clearly, Lord of the good spirit, of word, and action, I knowing through my Righteousness Him who is Ahura Mazda. And to Him (not here alone, but) in His home of song, His praise we shall bear. {#45:8}

Yea, Him with our better Mind we seek to honour, who desiring (good), shall come to us (to bless) in weal and sorrow. May He, Ahura Mazda, make us vigorous through Khshathra's royal power, [pg 129] our flocks and men in thrift to further, from the good support and bearing of His Good Mind, (itself born in us) by His Righteousness. {#45:9}

Him in the Yasnas of our Piety we seek to praise with homage, who in His persistent energy was famed to be (in truth) the Lord Ahura Mazda, for He hath appointed in His kingdom, through His holy Order and His Good Mind, both Weal and Immortality, to grant the eternal mighty pair to this our land (and the creation). {#45:10}

(Him would we magnify and praise) who hath despised the Daēva-gods and alien men, them who before held Him in their derision. Far different are (these) from him who gave Him honour. This latter one is through the Saoshyaṇt's bounteous Faith, who likewise is the Lord of saving power, [pg 130] a friend, brother, or a father to us, Mazda Lord! {#45:11}

On the part of a kinsman (prince), or allied peer, none, to conciliate, give (offerings) to me (to help my cause), nor yet the throngs of labour, (not) even such as these, nor yet (still less) the evil [pg 135] tyrants of the province. How then shall I (establish well the Faith, and thus) conciliate Thy (grace), O Lord? {#46:1}

This know I, Mazda! wherefore I am thus unable to attain my wish, and why my flocks are so reduced in number, and why my following is likewise scant. Therefore I cry to Thee; behold it, Lord! desiring helpful grace for me, as friend bestows on friend. (Therefore to meet my spirit's need, and this as well) declare and teach to me the Good Mind's wealth. {#46:2}

When come, Great Giver! they who are the day's enlighteners, to hold the Righteous Order of the world upright, and forward pressing? When are [pg 136] the schemes of the saviour Saoshyaṇts with (their) lofty revelations (to appear)? To whom for help does he (their chief) approach, who has Thy Good Mind (as his fellow-worker)? Thee, for mine exhorter and commander, Living Lord! I choose. {#46:3}

(But e’er these helpers come to me, all rests as yet in gloom.) The evil man is holding back those who are the bearers of the Righteous Order from progress with the Kine, (from progress with the sacred cause) within the region, or the province, he, the evil governor, endowed with evil might, consuming life with evil deeds. Wherefore, whoever hurls him from his power, O Mazda! or from life, stores for the Kine in sacred wisdom shall he make. [pg 137] {#46:4}

(Yea), he who, as ruler, treats no coming applicant with injury, as a good citizen (or nobly wise) in sacred vow and duty, and living righteously in every covenant, who, as an uncorrupted judge, discerns the wicked (that leader who, rejecting me, would keep back those who propagate the Faith), let him, (this righteous judge,) declare (the vengeance) to that (hostile) lord, (my) kinsman. Yea, let him crush him when he sallies forth (to approach us for our harm)! {#46:5}

(And he who leaves him in his guilty error has my curse.) Yea, he who has the power, and will not thus (with stern reproof) approach him, shall go to [pg 138] the abode of the Lie, (and) the enchainer. For he is evil who is the best one to the evil, and he is holy who is friendly to the righteous, as Thou didst fix the moral laws, O Lord! {#46:6}

Whom, then, as guard, O Mazda! hast Thou set me then when that wicked one still held me for his hate? Whom (had I) then but Thee, Thy Fire and Mind, Ahura! by deeds performed in which Thy Righteous rule is saved and nurtured? Therefore that spiritual power (vouchsafing me) for the (holy) Faith (its truths) declare. {#46:7}

And as to him who (now by evil power) delivers up my settlements to harm, let not his burning (wrath) in deeds attain me. But bearing back the (evil will and evil influence of such), let these things come (back) to him in anger. Let that to his body come which holds from welfare; but let no (help) [pg 139] at all (approach him, which may) keep him back from misery. (And let this happen as I speak) from (vengeful) hate, O Lord! {#46:8}

But who is the freely helping one who will teach me foremost how we may adore Thee, Thou the well to be invoked as in Thy deeds, the holy, bountiful Ahura? What (words) the Kine's creator spake for Thee by aid of, and to aid, the Righteous ritual Order, these words of Thine, (Thy people coming) with Thy Good Mind, are seeking now (to gain and learn from) me, O Mazda Lord! [pg 140] {#46:9}

Whoever, man or woman, shall give to me those (gifts) of life which Thou hast known as best, O Mazda! and as a holy blessing through (Thy) Righteous Order, a throne (established) with (Thy) Good Mind, (with these I shall go forth; yea, those) whom I shall (accompany and so) incite, to the homage of such as You (on earth), forth to the Judge's Bridge (itself) with all of them shall I lead on (at last). {#46:10}

(And they and I have every need for help, for now) the Karpan and the Kavi will join in governments to slay the life of man with evil deeds, they whom their own souls and their own conscience will becry. And when they approach there where the Judge's Bridge (extends, unlike the believing ones of God, who go so firmly forth with me as guide and helper, these shall miss their path and fall), and [pg 141] in the Lie's abode for ever shall their habitation be. {#46:11}

(But for the penitent there is yet hope; for all our former foes shall not thus fall, as from the Cinvaṭ Bridge to woe, for) when from among the tribes and kith of the Turanian, even among the more powerful ones of the Fryāna, those shall arise who further on the settlements of Piety with energy and zeal, with these shall Ahura dwell together through His Good Mind (in them), and to them for joyful grace deliver His commands. {#46:12}

Yea, he who will propitiate Zarathuśtra Spitāma with gifts midst men, this man is fitted for the proclamation, and to him Ahura Mazda will give the (prospered) life. And he will likewise cause the settlements to thrive in mental goodness. We think him, therefore, Your good companion to (further and maintain) Your Righteousness (and meet for Your approach). [pg 142] {#46:13}

(A voice from among the Chiefs.)

(But where is such an one?) Whom hast thou Zarathuśtra! thus a holy friend for the great (effort of the) cause? Who is it who thus desires to speak it forth? (Zarathuśtra answers. Aye, such an one  have.) It is our Kavi Vīśtāspa, the heroic; (and not he alone, but all) whom thou shalt (as in Thy prophet) meet in the assembly, O Ahura Mazda! these likewise will I call (to my attempt), and with Thy Good Mind's words. {#46:14}

O ye Haēcaṭ-aspas, Spitāmas! to you will I now address my words, since ye discern the things unlawful, and the lawful, for these your actions to establish (firmly on its base) for you the Righteous Order through those which are the Lord's primeval laws. {#46:15}

(And to the Hvōgvas would I likewise speak.) Thou Frashaośtra Hvōgva (whom I see); go thou [pg 143] (forth) with the generous helpers, with those whom we are praying for as for salvation to the land. Go thou where Piety joins hand in hand with the Righteous Order, where are the wished-for Realms of Good Mind, where Mazda in His most honoured home abides, {#46:16}

Where in your measured verse I will declare aloud (the praises), not in unmeasured lines, Jāmāspa Hvōgva! but songs of homage (will I weave) with ever gained Obedience in offering. (And unto Mazda) will I chant them, yea, to Him who will discern aright what things are lawful (or) unlawful (which I thus do, or utter), and with His wonder-working thoughts of Righteousness (attend). {#46:17}

(For) whosoever (offers) sanctity to me, to him shall be the best gifts whatsoever. Yea, of my [pg 144] (spirit's) wealth will I bestow on him through Thy Good Mind (which I give), but oppressions will I send on him who as oppressor will deliver us to anguish, O Mazda! desiring, as I do, to satisfy Your choice by righteous (vengeance). This is the decision of mine understanding and my will. {#46:18}

(Yea, this I earnestly announce.) He who from Righteousness (in mind and life) shall verily perform for me, for Zarathuśtra, that which is thus most helpful (for my cause) according to my earnest wish (and through my words of urgent zeal) on him shall they bestow reward(s) beyond this earth, with all the mental blessings gained through the sacred mother-kine. And these things (all) did’st Thou (Thyself) command to me, O Mazda, Thou most wise! [pg 145] {#46:19}

*THE BOUNTIFULNESS OF AHURA.* [pg 147]

And to this (man, His chosen saint), Ahura Mazda will give both the two (greatest gifts, His) [pg 148] Universal Weal and Immortality, by means of His bountiful Spirit, and with His Best Mind, from (the desire to maintain His) Righteous moral Order in word and deed, and by the (strength and wisdom) of His Sovereign Power, (established) in Piety (among His folk). {#47:11}

Aye, (that blessedness, which is the) best (creation) of this most bounteous spirit, Ahura Mazda will bring forth in action with words from the mouth and tongue of His Good Mind (within His seers), and by the two hands of Āramaiti (His Piety as she lives within the soul). And by such wise (beneficence is) He the father of the righteous Order (within our worship and our lives). {#47:2}

And Thou art therein, O Ahura Mazda! the bountiful One who appertains to, and who possesses, that (most bounteous) spirit in that Thou art He who for this (man, in whom this spirit works) hath made the joy-creating Kine. (And as to her), for her, as [pg 149] joyful meadows of her peace, wilt Thou bestow (Thine) Āramaiti (who is our Piety as earth considered), since he (for her) hath taken counsel with Thy Good Mind, Lord! {#47:3}

(But this Thy bounteous spirit doth not alone bestow rewards and blessings on the good.) The wicked (foemen of the Faith) are harmed, and from (the motives which move) that bounteous spirit (of Thine own), O Mazda! but not thus the saints. (And yet the ruler's pride would ever slight the righteous.) The feeble man alone stands free to give in kindly obligation to Thy saint, but having wealth and ruling power, the evil (man) is (at the service) of the wicked, and for much. [pg 150] {#47:4}

But Thou wilt give these gifts, and through Thy (most blessed and most) bounteous spirit, O Ahura Mazda! to this Thy holy saint, for they are whatsoever is the best; but far from Thy love the wicked has his portion, abiding in the actions of the Evil Mind. {#47:5}

Aye, these things wilt Thou give (to him), O Thou Ahura Mazda! and through Thy bounteous spirit, (and) by Thy Fire as in a good bestowal to [pg 151] the two striving (throngs) through the prosperous increase of our Piety, and of the Righteous ritual and moral Truth; for that (Piety of ours instructing) doth teach the many coming ones who seek her (face)! {#47:6}

## YASNA XLVIII.

*ANTICIPATED STRUGGLES AND PRAYERS FOR CHAMPIONS AND DEFENDERS.* [pg 153]

If through his action in the offering of gifts in accordance with the Righteous Order, (Thy saint) shall smite the Demon-of-the-Lie (the inspiring spirit of our foes), when that in very truth shall come, which has been (and is still yet) proclaimed as a deceit, (when it shall come) in the Immortal life, regarding (as it does both) men (to bless), and Daēvas (to afflict them), then shall (Thy faithful worshipper) increase thereby the celebration of Thy praise, O Lord! and with it blessings (for Thy folk). {#48:1}

Tell me then, Lord? (the end), for Thou dost [pg 154] know it. (Tell me to grant me strength and courage) before those conflicts come which shall encounter me (as leader of Thy tribes); shall the champion of Thy holy Order, O Ahura! smite (at last) the evil heretic, and when? (I ask Thee this); for this if it be gained (is known) to be the (one) good consummation of (our) life. {#48:2}

(Yea, tell me then this), for to the enlightened man is that the best of teachings which the beneficent Ahura doth proclaim, and through (the revelations of) His holy Order, bounteous as he and wise with His intelligence, as well as they who declare to us (still other) secret sayings (in His name). The one like Thee (their chieftain) is, O Mazda! endowed with Thy Good Mind's understanding thoughts. [pg 155] {#48:3}

(Yea, tell me the secret of the future struggle; for that enlightened man) must follow close the holy Faith (for which that struggle had its toil and effort). Yea, O Mazda! he who would bend his mind (till it attains to) that which is the better and more holy, must pursue the Daēna close in word and action. His will and wish must be consistent with his chosen creed and fealty, and in Thine Understanding (which discerneth all) shall he in many ways be (versed) at last! {#48:4}

* * *

(But while I as yet know not the issue, I can yet hope and pray.) Let the good kings obtain the rule. Let not the evil monarchs govern us, (but let the righteous gain the day and rule us), with deeds done in a good discernment, O thou pious wisdom, Āramaiti! sanctifying to men's minds the best of blessings for (their) offspring. Yea, for the Kine, (O Āramaiti!) [pg 156] let (Thy) toil be given, and may’st Thou cause her to prosper for our life. {#48:5}

For she will grant us pleasing homes, and, (while we live) in this Thy Good Mind's longing prayer (to gain her welfare), she grants us likewise lasting strength (for every deed which that Thy Good Mind moves us to perform), and therefore hath Mazda caused the plants to flourish for her (nurture), He, Ahura, in the generation of primeval life. {#48:6}

* * *

(Then in our coming strife let both her mortal foes be slain.) Let the Wrath-demon of rapine be cast down. Smite ye against the envy (which would plot against our Throne), O ye who, abiding by the Good Mind, and in accordance with our holy Order, desire to hold that refuge fast, to whose sacred bond the bounteous man belongs. And therefore, [pg 157] O Ahura! (to save Thy struggling saint who toils with changing lot) will I place (that refuge) for him in Thy world. {#48:7}

(And how shall I beseech Thee for this victory and gift?) What is the (potent) prayer to bring on that Thy holy Reign? What for Thy sacred reward and blessing for my (soul)? How shall I seek the open helpers for (the spread and maintenance of) Thy (great) Order, while I myself live on in Thy Good Spirit's deeds? {#48:8}

(Aye, when shall faith be changed to sight); and when shall I in verity discern if Ye indeed have power over aught, O Lord! and through Thy Righteous Order (guarding here on earth), O Thou within whose (power lie) my griefs and doubts? Let then Thy saving prophet find and gain aright (for) my delight Thy Good Mind's wonder-working [pg 158] grace; yea, let Thy Saoshyaṇt see how gifts of recompense may be his own. {#48:9}

When, Mazda! shall the men of mind's perfection come? And when shall they drive from hence, the soil of this (polluted) drunken joy, whereby the Karpans with (their) angry zeal would crush us, and by whose inspiration the tyrants of the provinces (hold on) their evil rule? {#48:10}

Yea, when shall our perfected Piety appear [pg 159] together with Thy Righteousness? When shall she come, as having the amenities of home for us, and provided (like our land) with pastures (for the kine)? And who shall give us quiet from the cruel (men) of evil life and faith? To whom shall Thy Good Mind's sacred wisdom come (to guide them in their toil to rescue and avenge us)? {#48:11}

(To whom? The answer lieth near.) Such shall be the Saviours of the Provinces, and they who, through Thy Good Mind's grace, shall go on hand in hand with mental keenness (as it spreads among Thy saints) by the doing every deed of Thy commandment, O Ahura! through the help of, and in accordance with, Thy Holy Order; for such as these are set (for us), as steadfast foes of hate! {#48:12}

## YASNA XLIX.

*REVERSES AND HOPES. HONOUR TO FRASHAOŚTRA AND OTHER CHIEFS.* [pg 162]

Beṇdva has ever fought with me; (yea, since he first appeared at hand to threaten, and alas to his advantage in the strife) He is the most powerful (in brutal might), and (in his predominance) would crush my strength as I seek to win back the disaffected (in my host) through Righteous (zeal), O Mazda! Come then with gifts of (vengeful) good to (meet) my sorrow. Through (Thine inspiring) Good Mind obtain (for me) that (Beṇdva's) death! {#49:1}

(Aye, he is indeed the greatest), for that [pg 163] Beṇdva's evil judge doth cause me to hesitate and ponder (in my earnest course of propagation and reform), a deceiver as he is, (estranged) from the Righteous Order, and receiving from it (not happiness) but many a wound. The bountiful and perfect Piety he has not maintained nor strengthened for this land, nor questions with Thy Good Mind hath he asked (to gain him light), O Lord! {#49:2}

But (all is not yet lost!); for this religious choice (our holy creed, for which our last lost battle has been fought), O Mazda! Thy blessed Order (our guardian help) has yet been set to save and bless us. (But) for (that evil) Judge, the Demon-of-the-Lie, (is set) to deal (for him) her wounds. Therefore do I pray (the more) for the sheltering leadership of Thy Good Mind (within our folk and our commanders). And all the allies of the wicked I abjure. {#49:3}

They who with evil scheme and will shall cherish and help on the Wrath of Rapine, and with her Rāma, and (not by silent favour, but) with their [pg 164] very tongues, whose will and wish (run) not with good but evil deeds. These settle and support the Daēvas (in their power, not the Lord). It is the wicked's Faith and Insight (so to do. Their faith is the perverted). {#49:4}

But he, O Mazda! is our abundance and our fatness, who (will yet dare these unbelieving foes) and guard the Faith (against that envious Wrath), and with the Good Mind's power. For every man of Piety is a wise citizen in accordance with the holy Order, and so are all who are (in truth) within Thy Realm, O Lord! {#49:5}

And now, will I beseech of You, O Mazda, and Righteousness (within Thy Mãthra) speaks (to tell me) what lies within Your will's intention, that (having discerned Your Insight as the enlightened [pg 165] ever must), I may as well discern aright how we can herald forth those (truths), and that pure Daēna (with them) which is the Faith of Him who is Thyself, O Lord. {#49:6}

, And (as we speak it forth as taught by Asha) then let the (zealous citizen) give heed, and with Thy Good Mind, O Ahura Mazda! Yea, let him give ear in accordance with (the dictate of) the Holy Order, and do Thou hear alike as well. Who shall be the ally; and who the kinsman-lord himself, who, with his gifts and (legal rules), shall institute and settle for the serving mass a worthy praise (for God)? {#49:7}

(And I do not ask in vain, for such an one is found for us, and near at hand.) To Frashaośtra hast Thou given that most favouring guardian power, the headship of the Holy Order (for us), O [pg 166] Ahura! This therefore would I pray of Thee (to confirm to him that gracious gift), and for myself likewise, would I now seek as well that sheltering headship which is within Thy Realm; yea, most blest and foremost may we both for ever be within it. {#49:8}

Aye, let the zealous and thrifty husbandman, so formed for giving help and blessings, give heed and listen when I call, (O Mazda!) Let not the truthful (tiller, he who hears and speaks Thy word), be he who takes that sheltering chieftainship together with the wicked. Let the believing natures (only) join in that best recompense. And thus in the course of the holy Order are in the fact so joined those two, Jāmāspa and the 'hero'. {#49:9}

(And since these champions thus join in that reward), then therefore will I place as well in Thy [pg 167] protection (Thy) Good Mind (in the living) and the spirits (of the dead. Yea, I confide our very) self-humbling praises, (which we offer, unto Thee), by which (Thine) Āramaiti (who is our Piety, exists), and likewise sacrificing zeal. And this would we do to further Thy great Sovereign Power (among Thy folk), and with undying (?) strength. {#49:10}

(But as to faithless reprobates); the souls (of the evil dead) shall meet those evil men who serve their evil rulers, who speak with evil words, and harbour evil consciences, these souls (in Hell) shall come with evil food (to welcome them), and in the Lie's abode their dwelling verily shall be! {#49:11}

* * *

## YASNA XLIX, 12-L. [pg 170]

What aids of grace hast Thou for Thine invoking Zarathuśtra, (O Ahura Mazda!) to grant him through Thy Righteous Order? Yea, what (aids of grace hast thou for me as) through Thy Good Mind given (within my soul), for me who will (still) pray to Thee with praises, O Great Creator! beseeching what in accordance with Your wished-for aim is best? {#49:12}

Aye, doth my soul indeed obtain assisting [pg 171] grace, and which of Thy blessings is that gift to me, O Lord? What saving champion is found to save both flocks and herds? And who for myself other than Thy Righteous Order, and Thyself, Ahura? Tell me, O (ye) invoked ones! Or what of grace is there for me save Thy Best Mind (itself)? {#50:1}

(And if Thy guardian is verily to save our wealth) how shall he (obtain, and by what means shall he) seek after that joy-creating Kine (who is the living symbol of our peace)? (How shall that man obtain his wish) who shall desire to see her provided with pastures for (the welfare of) this land? (That only way is righteousness.) Do Thou then grant me lands (so would I ask of Thee) which live in justice in the many splendours of the sun, and lands which openly thus live, and which are to be [pg 172] sought and gained by me (as conquests for the cause). Give Thou this gift! {#50:2}

(Yea, let that joy-creating one) be his possession through the Righteous Order (which he helps to bring, that living sign) which (the most valiant citizen) may give to him (at once reward and charge), and in accordance with Thy Sovereign Authority. (May that heroic settler grant him this gift) he who may make the (last imperilled) farm to flourish in the vigour of Thy blest prosperity, the tract which lies the nearest (to the fields) which our foeman holds as his. {#50:3}

(And therefore both in thankfulness and hope) will I give sacrifice to You with praises, O Ahura Mazda! together with Thine Order and Thy Best Mind (in Thy saints), and in accordance with Thy sacred Sovereign Power, by whose help the wisher (heaven-bound) may stand upon the (certain) pathway, and in Thine Home-of-song shall I (by means of these my Yasnas offered here) there hear the praises of Thine offering saints who see Thy face. {#50:4}

And we are in readiness as well (to fulfil Your praises and declare your words), O Ahura Mazda! through Your (grace, and) in accordance with Your Holy Order, since Ye advance with friendliness to cheer the speaker of Your Mãthra-word with open acts of visible relief, as if with hand sent forth, [pg 173] whereby that Mãthra-speaker of Your truth may bring us on, and settle us, in weal and bliss. {#50:5}

(Therefore will I incite him to his task the more. Let him indeed proclaim the righteous way) he who already lifts his voice in Mãthras, O Ahura Mazda! he, Zarathuśtra, the faithful friend in accordance with the Holy Order, and with self-abasing worship, giver of understanding for this land, voice-guider (of the way to glory), let him indeed proclaim and teach my regulations, and in accordance with Thy Good Mind (as his law). {#50:6}

(And together with that chief speaker of your word I would engage yet others in the cause). Your well-incited and swift (servants), O Ahura! would I yoke on (as steeds to take their holy course toward heaven), gaining thereby (at last) the Bridges where [pg 174] Your adoration (rules and is complete). Yea, I (?) yoke on your mighty ones, and with Thy Holy Order, and Thy Good Mind. And with these may Ye drive on; aye, be Ye for my help! {#50:7}

(And as I yoke on Your Mãthra-speakers for their course, then) would I (myself) approach You in the (highest) deed of worship, and with these sacred metric feet (of Zarathuśtra and his peers), those which are heard and famed afar, as the metric feet of zealous worship, and with my hands stretched out (in supplicating prayer). Yea, You (would I approach), O Mazda! in union with Your sacred ritual Truth, and with the homage of a freely-giving helper, and with the good virtue of (Your) Good Mind (in my soul). {#50:8}

Yea, with these Yasnas of Your sacrifice would I approach You, praising back to You (in answer to Your mercies), O Ahura! and Thou, O Righteousness! in (the holy) actions of Your Good Mind, (as he moves within us), so long indeed as I shall have the power, commanding at my will o’er this my sacred (privilege) and gift. (And doing as) the wise man (thus), may I (like him) become a supplicant who gains his ends. {#50:9}

(Mine every wish and prayer is this), then therefore whatsoever I shall do, and whatsoever deeds [pg 175] (of ritual and truth I shall yet further do) on account of, (and to make full) these (prior deeds of worship), yea, whatsoever (holy works) shine bright as having worth in (all) men's eyes through Thy Good Mind (whose character they share; these as) the stars, suns, and the Aurora which brings on the light of days, are all, through their Righteous Order, (the speakers) of Thy praise, O Thou Great Giver, Lord! {#50:10}

Your praiser then (by eminence) would I be named, and (more), would be it, so long as by (Thine inspiring) Righteousness I am thus able and may have the power. And may the maker of the world give help through (His implanted) Good Mind (in my fellow-servants). And may that (all) be done (to further us) which through His veritable grace is most promotive (for the cause)! [pg 176] {#50:11}

# THE GĀTHA(Ā) VOHŪ KHSHATHREM

## YASNA LI.

*INSTRUCTIONS AND APPEALS TO AN ASSEMBLY OF THE FAITHFUL.* [pg 178]

The good Government (of Ahura) is to be chosen (among all wished-for things) as that lot which most of all brings on (our happiness). Actions that oppress us it opposes, through the holy Order (which pervades it), and with the pious zeal (of its true servants). Therefore, O Great Creator! let me [pg 179] produce, and help bring on (that Sovereign Power) which is the best for us at every present hour. {#51:1}

And first I will ask for these two blessings of Your own, O Thou Great Creator, and thou His Righteous Order! and I also ask of thee, Our Piety (personified, as well); and grant me this Your Sovereign Rule over our desired wealth (to give and to preserve it; and likewise) those spiritual blessings which are advantageous for our worship (of Ahura) through (the inspiration of His) Good Mind (within the soul). {#51:2}

(And it is not I alone who thus appeal to You; I speak for all) who are guarded in the (ceremonial and moral) actions of Your (law), and by those (inspired) words (which proceed) from the tongue of Thy Good Mind (as he speaks within Thy Mãthra). Yea, these are all assembling (each) to hear You, of whom Thou, O Ahura Mazda! art the foremost guide and light. {#51:3}

(And they cry aloud to Thee, O Mazda! I speaking with them, and in their name): Where is the (promised) lord of our thrift (the embodied law, saving us from the most dreaded dangers that we fear, the thrift-lord) of (our) ready zeal? Where [pg 180] does he stand to (show us) mercy? Whither are (Thy) Righteousness and the Bountiful Āramaiti (our Piety) approaching? From what direction comes Thy Best Mind (to inspire and to guide)? And whence (again), O Great Creator! Thy Sovereign Power (to be our ruler and defence)? {#51:4}

And it is the tiller of the earth who asks this of Thee, O Ahura! (Thy chosen saint himself); he has asked this all of Thee, striving to discover how he may gain to himself the sacred Kine (and with all wealth in herds beside. And he would seek this) moved by the motives which flow from Thy Righteous Order (and Thy cause), upright as he is in actions, and wise in his self-humbling worship (of that One) who, as a righteous ruler, has appointed a just controlling guide for those whom He has made. {#51:5}

(And in partial answer to his question, and to solve his doubt, I now declare the truth): He who gives to this (good citizen) that which is better than the good; yea, He who bestows on him in accordance with his religious choice is (our) Ahura Mazda (and not [pg 181] a false god of the Daēvas). And this will He bestow through His divine Authority (established in preparation here), while on the withholder of the sacrifice, who offers nothing to His (cause), He will send worse than the evil (and that not here alone, but) in the last turning of the creation in its course! {#51:6}

(And as Thou wilt bestow thus graciously on him), so grant me also, O Thou most bountiful Spirit Mazda, Thou who hast made both the Kine and the waters and the plants (for her support) both Immortality and Welfare, those two eternal powers, and through Thy Good Mind in the doctrine (which is revealed through his inspired words). {#51:7}

(Yea, grant me these two inseparable gifts, for having them in store) I will speak for Thee, O Mazda! because to the man of understanding one should declare for Thee that which is woe to the wicked, but salvation to him who has maintained the holy Order (in Thy folk and in his soul). For he is (repaid in his deed, and) rejoiced by the Mãthra who declares it to the wise. {#51:8}

(And when I shall speak, I will declare for You that mental) keenness (which reaches the decision), and which Thou hast bestowed upon the two striving sides, (in Thy satisfying word). And this [pg 182] I will announce by means of Thy flaming Fire; yea, I will declare it for the bestowal of that sword of justice which is forged from steel, and wrought for both the worlds. And for the wounding of the wicked (with its blade) may’st Thou, O Ahura Mazda! bless and prosper Thine (avenging) saint! {#51:9}

(Yea, let Thy believer wound the wicked to the quick), for he, who totally estranged from this (our holy rule), O Mazda! seeks to destroy my life, is a son of the Lie's creation, and belongs to the miscreants; (but as for me), I call on Asha (Thy Righteous Order to be my help); and may he come with Thy good blessing. {#51:10}

(And ye who throng the great assembly, it is of you I speak while, with my lips, I now address the Lord): Who, O Ahura! is a loyal friend to the Spitāma, to Zarathuśtra? Who has asked his question of the divine Righteousness, (as he approached)? [pg 183] By whom is the bounteous Piety (received and cherished)? Or who has been regarded as upright and fitted for the great cause of Thy Good Mind? {#51:11}

('Who is worthy?' would I ask, for Zarathuśtra was ever such, and from earliest days. He was no polluted wretch.) Paederast never gained his ear, nor Kavi-follower on this (temptation-)bridge of earth, when his body was (maturely) grown, when they both hasten(ed) to him with the bosom's impure power. {#51:12}

(And he will be likewise victorious on the veritable Judgment Bridge, for) the righteous man's conscience will truly crush the wicked man's (spirit) while his soul rages fiercely on the open Cinvaṭ Bridge, as he strives by his actions, and his tongue's [pg 184] (cursing speech) to reach (and to pollute) Asha's paths (where the faithful souls come). {#51:13}

(And as are those lost spirits, so are our foes.) No friends to the creatures are the Karpans, (not granting) complete (harvests) from the fields with complete (pasture) for the Kine (chief objects for our prayer), bringing woe by their deeds and their teachings. And they will deliver these (beings whom they lead) at the last (?) by their doctrine(s) in the Home of the Lie. {#51:14}

But this is the reward which Zarathuśtra declared before (to his friends who counsel with Asha), and are fitted for the cause; Ahura Mazda will come the first into His Song Home, Garōḍman, [pg 185] and then these gifts will be given you by the Good Mind (within you), and with blessings for the cause of the Righteous Order (in His hosts). {#51:15}

(And one of you, the greatest, has indeed attained to that wisdom which is thus blessed with a promise), Kavi Vīśtāspa has reached it in the Realm of our great cause (of devotion), and moved in his toil by the chants of the Good Mind (who speaks in the Mãthra); yea, he hath attained to that wisdom which the bountiful Ahura conceived in accordance with Asha, thus to teach us salvation. {#51:16}

(And not alone amidst our princes hath sanctity been marked), Frashaośtra, the Hvōgva, hath presented a blest and an endeared form (his child); and may Ahura Mazda, who has the Sovereign Power, grant her (to us), who is so much to be beloved. And for the (progress of the) good Religion do ye, O ye people! receive her with desire, and for the gaining of Asha; (she will help the great cause). {#51:17}

Yea, that (holy) wisdom, O Jāmāspa the Hvōgva! these (pious throngs) are choosing through [pg 186] their Righteousness as the (true) splendours of riches (these pious men who are) gaining the kingdom where the Good Mind (doth govern). And grant me also, O Mazda! that which these with glad wishes receive from Thy grace. {#51:18}

(And this prayer is already and beforehand heard.) This established Sovereign Power the heroic (Kavi Vīśtāspa has given), O Maidhyō-māh the Spitāma. He who is wise through the Religion, and who seeks (the true) life, he is granting it to us; yea, he has pronounced the laws of Ahura our Maker, and declared that which is for (our) life's actions (beyond all other things) best. {#51:19}

And, that gift of blessedness for you, all (the Bountiful Immortals) with one consent in sympathy to help us (are disposed) to grant; (and may they likewise make) the Holy Order (firm) for us through the Good Mind (in our folk); and may they reveal to us the words with which Piety likewise (speaks her truths). And receiving sacrifice with homage (from our praises), may they seek for us Ahura Mazda's grace. {#51:20}

(Yea, this Kavi Vīśtāspa) the man of Āramaiti is bounteous, and with understanding in his words and his actions. (And as a reward) may Ahura give [pg 187] him that Righteousness which is blest, (but) with the Religion (alone), and that Sovereign Power which is established through the Good Mind (in His folk). And this same blessing would I pray from His grace. {#51:21}

For Ahura Mazda knoweth the man whose best gift for the sacrifice is given unto me, and from the motive of Righteousness; (and in thankfulness for all, and in prayer for yet still further grace), I will worship (the eternal ones); yea, I will worship those who have ever lived, and who still live, and by their own (holy) names, and to their (thrones) will I draw near with my praise! {#51:22}

# THE GĀTHA(Ā) VAHIŚTĀ ĪŚTIŚ (VAHIŚTŌIŚTI(Ī)).

## YASNA LIII. [pg 190]

That best prayer has been answered, the prayer of Zarathuśtra Spitāma, that Ahura Mazda might grant him those boons, (the most wished-for) which flow from the good Order, even a life that is prospered for eternal duration, and also those who deceived him (may He likewise thus grant him) as the good Faith's disciples in word and in deed. {#53:1}

And may Kavi Vīśtāspa, and the Zarathuśtrian Spitāma, and Frashaośtra too with them, offer propitiation to Mazda in thought, word, and deed, and [pg 191] Yasna confessions as they render Him praise, making straight paths (for our going), even that Faith of the Saoshyaṇt which Ahura will found. {#53:2}

(The master of the feast.)

And him will they give Thee, O Pourucista, Haēcaṭ-aspid and Spitāmi! young (as thou art) of the daughters of Zarathuśtra, him will they give thee as a help in the Good Mind's true service, of Asha's and Mazda's, as a chief and a guardian. Counsel well then (together), with the mind of Ārmaiti, most bounteous and pious; and act with just action. {#53:3}

(She answers.)

I will love and vie with him, since from (my) father he gained (me). For the master and toilers, and for the lord-kinsman (be) the Good Mind's bright [pg 192] blessing, the pure for the pure ones, and to me (be) the insight (which I gain from his counsel). Mazda grant it, Ahura for good conscience for ever. {#53:4}

(The priestly master of the feast.)

Monitions for the marrying I speak to (you) maidens, to you, I who know them; and heed ye my (sayings): By these laws of the Faith which I utter obtain ye the life of the Good Mind (on earth and in heaven). (And to you, bride and bridegroom), let each one the other in Righteousness cherish; thus alone unto each shall the home-life be happy. {#53:5}

\[Thus real are these things, ye men and ye women!\] from the Lie-demon protecting, I guard o’er my (faithful), and so (I) grant progress (in weal and in goodness). And the hate of the Lie (with the hate of her) bondsmen (?) I pray from the body, (and so would expel it). For to those who bear Vayu, (and bring him to power), his shame mars the glory. To these evil truth-harmers by these means he reaches. Ye thus slay the life mental (if ye follow his courses). [pg 193] {#53:6}

But yours be the recompense, (O ye righteous women!) of this great cause. For while lustful desire heart-inflamed from the body there beyond goeth down where the spirit of evil reaches (to ruin, still) ye bring forth the champion to help on the cause, (and thus conquer temptation). So your last word is 'Vayu'; (ye cry it in triumph). {#53:7}

And thus let the sinners by these means be foiled; and consumed be they likewise. Let them shriek in their anger. With good kings let (our champion) deliver the smiter (as a captive in [pg 194] battle), giving peace to our dwellings, and peace to our hamlets. Let him charge those deceivers, chaining death as the strongest; and swift be (the issue). {#53:8}

Through false believers the tormentor makes Thy helpers refusers; (those who once helped our heroes shall no longer give succour). The estranged thus desires, and the reprobate wills it, with the will that he harbours to conquer our honour. Where is then the Lord righteous who will smite them from life, and (beguile) them of license? Mazda! Thine is that power, (which will banish and conquer). And Thine is the Kingdom; and by it Thou bestowest the highest (of blessings) on the right-living poor! {#53:9}
