# THE GĀHS.

[pg 379]

## I. THE GĀH HĀVAN [^1535].

Unto Ahura Mazda be propitiation. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best—.

1\. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of Zarathuśtra's order, a foe to the Daēvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for the holy Hāvani, regulator of the ritual order, for its sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and for Sāvanghi and Vīsya, the righteous regulator(s) of the ritual order, for their homage, sacrifice, propitiation, and praise, and for those of the Asnya, the day-lords during daylight, and the Ayara, lords of the days in their length, and for the Māhya, the month-lords, and the Yāirya, year-lords, and for those of the especial seasons. {#I:1}

2\. And to Mithra of the wide pastures, of the thousand ears, of the myriad eyes, the Yazad of the spoken name [^1536], be sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise, and to Rāman Hvāstra. {#I:2}

3, 4. And we sacrifice to Ahura Mazda the holy [pg 380] lord of the ritual Order, and to Zarathuśtra, and to the Fravashi of Zarathuśtra, the saint. And we sacrifice to the Bounteous Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints, and to the good, heroic, and bounteous Fravashis of the saints (of the living and of the dead), of the bodily, and of those in heaven. And we sacrifice to the highest of the lords, the one that most attains its ends; and we sacrifice to the most strenuous of the Yazads, the most satisfying of the lords of the ritual order, the one who reaches (what he seeks), the most infallibly of those who have as yet approached the nearest in the ritual, even to the timely prayer of the saint who rules in the ritual order. 5. And we sacrifice to the Hāvani, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Universal Weal, the holy, ruling in the ritual order, and to Deathlessness, the holy, ruling in the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the question and lore of the holy lord of the ritual. And we sacrifice to that heroic mighty Yasna, the Haptanghāiti, the lord of the ritual order. 6. And we sacrifice to Sāvanghi and Vīsya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Airyemā-ishyō [^1537], the holy lord of the ritual order, the powerful, victoriously smiting, that which no hate can reach, which overwhelms all torments, and which passes over all torments with victory, which is the uppermost, and the middle, and the foremost, for the effective invocation of that surpassing Mãthra, the five Gāthas. {#I:3}

7, 8. And we sacrifice to Mithra of the wide pastures—, and to Rāman Hvāstra, for the worship and exaltation of Vīsya, the chief. And we sacrifice to [pg 381] Vīsya, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to Mithra, and to Rāman Hvāstra—. {#I:7}

9-11. And we sacrifice to thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son, the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to this Baresman which has the Zaothra with it, and the girdle with it, and which is spread with exact sanctity, itself the holy lord. And we sacrifice to the Apãm-napāṭ, and to Nairya-sangha, and to that Yazad, the swift curse of the wise. And we sacrifice to the souls of the dead, \[which are the Fravashis of the saints\]. And we worship that exalted Lord who is Ahura Mazda, the highest object of the ritual order, who is the one who has attained the most to homage in the ritual. And we sacrifice to all the words which Zarathuśtra spake, and to all the deeds well done, and to those which shall yet be done in days to come. (And) we sacrifice to that male one of beings whose (gift) in the offering Ahura doth know to be better, and of female saints, the same. As the Ahū is to be (revered and) chosen, so (is) the Ratu, one who rules from the Righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions done for Mazda, and the Kingdom (is) to Ahura, which to the poor shall offer a nurturer—. {#I:9}

[^1534]: The term Gāh, itself, may have arisen from the practice of chanting the Gāthas at different fixed times in the day.

[^1535]: To be recited every day at the time of Hāvani.

[^1536]: Having a special Yaśt.

[^1537]: The personified prayer; see Y. LIV.

## II. GĀH RAPITHVIN [^1538].

1\. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda. A blessing is Asha Vahiśta. I confess as a Mazda-worshipper, and of Zarathuśtra's order—for Rapithwina, the holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise, and for Frādaṭ-fshu and Zaṇtuma, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, [pg 382] propitiation, and for praise. 2. And propitiation be to Asha Vahiśta, and to Ahura Mazda's Fire, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise [^1539]. 3, 4. (See Y. LX XI, 2, 3.) {#II:1}

5\. And we sacrifice to the Rapithwina, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Gātha Ahunavaiti, the holy, and ruling in the ritual order; and to the Gātha Uśtavaiti, and to the Gātha Speṇtā-mainyu, and to the Gātha Vohu-khshathra, and to the Gātha Vahiśtōiśti, holy, and ruling in the ritual order. 6. And we sacrifice to Frādaṭ-fshu, and to Zaṇtuma, and to the Fshūshō-mãthra, even to the word correctly spoken, and we sacrifice to the (many) words correctly spoken, even to the victorious ones which slay the Demon-gods (the Daēvas [^1540]). And we sacrifice to the waters and the lands, and to the plants, and to the heavenly Yazads who are givers of the holy and the good. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints. {#II:5}

7\. And we sacrifice to the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the saints, and to the heights of Asha (called) Vahiśta, and to the greatest Mãthras as moving us to action, the greatest as teaching faithfulness to holy vows, the greatest as referring to actions which are evidently just, and the greatest for the acquisition of the Mazdayasnian Faith. 8. And we sacrifice to that assembly and reunion which the Bountiful Immortals hold when they gather (?) on the heights of Heaven, for the sacrifice and homage of Zaṇtuma, the lord. {#II:7}

And we (therefore) sacrifice to Zaṇtuma (as) the holy lord of the ritual order. 9. And we sacrifice [pg 383] to Asha Vahiśta (who is Righteousness the Best), and to the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son—. 10. Yea, we sacrifice to Thee, the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son, the holy ritual lord—.

I bless the sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness of Asha Vahiśta, and of the Fire, of Ahura Mazda—. And to this one be the glory!

[^1538]: Recited every day at the hour of Rapithwina.

[^1539]: The Ahuna follows.

[^1540]: Zarathuśtra conquered the Demon with the Ahuna-vairya.

And to that lofty Ahura, Apãm-napāṭ, and to the waters which Mazda created be sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise [^1542]! 3, 4. (G. I, 3, 4.) 5.

And we sacrifice to the manifest performer of the truth (the correct maintainer of the rites), the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the later lore; yea, we sacrifice to the manifest fulfiller of the truth, and to the (entire) creation of the holy (and the clean) by day and by night with Zaothras together with offered prayers, for the sacrifice and homage of Dahvyuma, the lord. And we sacrifice to Dahvyuma, the holy lord of the ritual order. 8.
