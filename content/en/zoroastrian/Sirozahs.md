[^4]: J. Halévy, Revue des Études Juives, 1881, October, p. 188.

[^5]: See Yt. I, 1-23.

[^6]: See Yt. II.

[^7]: See Yt. I, 24-33.

[^8]: Ākhśti does not so much mean Peace as the power that secures peace; see note 4.

[^9]: Hãm-vaiṇti, from hãm-vā (Yt. X, 141); possibly from van, to strike: 'Peace that smites.'

[^10]: Taradhātem anyāiś dāmãn, interpreted: tarvīnītārtūm min zakī ān dāmān pun anāshtīh akár kartan (Phl. Comm.), 'more destroying than other creatures, to make Non-peace (Anākhśti) powerless.'

[^11]: Āsnya khratu, the inborn intellect, intuition, contrasted with gaoshō-srūta khratu, the knowledge acquired by hearing and learning. There is between the two nearly the same relation as between the parāvidyā and aparāvidyā in Brahmanism, the former reaching Brahma in se (parabrahma), the latter śabdabrahma, the word-Brahma (Brahma as taught and revealed). The Mobeds of later times interpreted their name Magūś, ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/00400.jpg), as meaning, 'men without ears,'  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/00401.jpg), 'pour insinuer que leur Docteur avait puisé toute sa science dans le ciel et qu’il ne l’avait pas apprise par l’ouïe comme les autres hommes' (Chardin, III, 130; ed. Amsterdam).

[^12]: See Yt. III.

[^13]: See Vend. XXII.

[^14]: The 'golden instrument' mentioned in Nyāyiś I, 8.

[^15]: A personification of the Ormazdean weal; cf. Vend. XXII, 3 \[8\], and Yt. XIII, 42.

[^16]: Vouru-dōithra, kāmak dōisr; she is 'the genius of the good [pg 5] eye, mīnōī hucaśmīh' (Vend. XIX, 36 \[523\]), the reverse of the evil eye (Yasna LXVII, 62 \[LXVIII, 22\]; cf. Études Iraniennes, II, 182).

[^17]: Vend. Introd. IV, 33; Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 202-206.

[^18]: Ibid.

[^19]: Vend. Introd. IV, 30.

[^20]: See Yt. IV.

[^21]: See Vend. Introd. IV, 34.

[^22]: The white Hōm, or plant of immortality; see Vend. Introd. IV, 28.

[^23]: See Gāhs.

[^24]: See Yt. X.

[^25]: See Yt. XV. Cf. Yasna I, 3 (7-9), where Mithra and Rāma are invoked in company with the genius of the Hāvani period of the day.

[^26]: The Genius of Fire.

[^27]: Cf. Yasna I, 4 (10-12), where Asha-Vahiśta and Ātar are invoked in company with the genius of the Rapithwin period of the day.

[^28]: Literally 'the Son of the Waters;' he was originally the Fire of lightning, as born in the clouds (like the Vedic Apām napāt); he still appears in that character, Yt. VIII, 34; he is for that reason 'the lord of the females' because the waters were considered as females (cf. Yasna XXXVIII, 1 \[2\]). But, as napāṭ means also 'navel' (the same words having often the two meanings of navel' and offspring;' cf. nābhi in the Vedas and the Zend nāfyō, 'offspring,' from nāfa 'navel'), Apãm Napāṭ was interpreted as 'the spring of the waters, the navel of the waters,' which was supposed to be at the source of the Arvand (the Tigris; Neriosengh ad Yasna I, 5 \[15\]); cf. Yt. V, 72.

[^29]: Cf. Yasna I, 5 \[13-15\].

[^30]: See Yt. XIII.

[^31]: Perhaps better: 'to the flocks of Fravashis of the faithful, men and women.'

[^32]: The Genius of Victory; see Yt. XIV.

[^33]: Cf. Yasna I, 6 \[16-19\].

[^34]: See Yt. XI and Vend. Introd. IV, 31; Farg. XVIII, 14 seq.

[^35]: The Genius of Truth; see Yt. XII.

[^36]: Truth; see Yt. XVIII.

[^37]: Cf. Yasna I, 7 \[20-23\].

[^38]: The day before Ādar (Dai is the Persian ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/00600.jpg), 'yesterday,' which is the same word as the Sanskrit hyas, Latin heri). The eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-third days of the month are under the [pg 7] rule of Ahura and the Amesha-Speṇtas, like the first day; they have therefore no name of their own and are named from the day that follows. The month was divided into four weeks, the first two numbering seven days, the last two numbering eight.

[^39]: Or better the Glories of the Aryas' (Eramdeśaśrīṇām): the Glory or Hvarenō (Vend. Introd. IV, II, p. lxiii, note 1) is threefold, according as it illuminates the priest, the warrior, or the husbandman. Yaśt XIX is devoted to the praise of the Hvarenō.

[^40]: Or 'the awful kingly glory:' Kavi means a king, but it is particularly used of the kings belonging to the second and most celebrated of the two mythical dynasties of Iran. The Kavis succeeded the Paradhāta or Pēshdādians, and Darius Codomanes was supposed to be the last of them. For an enumeration of the principal Kavis, see Yt. XIII, 132 seq. The Hvarenō alluded to in this clause is the Hvarenō of the priest; 'it is the fire known as Ādaraprā \[Ādar Frobā\]; or better Ādar Farnbag: see Études Iraniennes, II, 84; its object is the science of the priests; by its help priests become learned and clever' (Sanskrit transl. to the Ātash Nyāyish).

[^41]: See Yt. V, 41, note.

[^42]: See Yt. XIX, 56.

[^43]: A mountain in Adarbaijān (Bundahiś XII, 26), where king Husravah settled the fire Gushasp.

[^44]: See Yt. V, 49.

[^45]: The glory of the warriors, the fire known as Ādar Gushasp or Gushnasp; with its help king Husravah destroyed the idol-temples near Lake Cēcast, and he settled it on Mount Āsnavaṇṭ (Bund. XVII, 7).

[^46]: A mountain in Khorāsān on which the Burzīn fire is settled (Bund. XII, 18).

[^47]: 'The fire known as Ādaraburajāmihira \[Ādar Burzīn Mihir\]; its object is the science of husbandry.' King Guśtāsp established it on Mount Raēvaṇṭ (Bund. XVII, 8).

[^48]: All sorts of fires. See another classification, Yasna XVII, II \[63-67\] and Bundahiś XVII, 1.

[^49]: See Vend. XXII, 7.

[^50]: The fire Nairyō-sangha, as the messenger of Ahura, burns hereditarily in the bosom of his earthly representative, the king.

[^51]: See Yt. V.

[^52]: See Yt. VI.

[^53]: See Yt. VII and Vend. XXI, I, text and note.

[^54]: Aēvō-dāta gāuś; see Vend. l. l. and Bundahiś IV.
