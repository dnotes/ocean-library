 [^1543]. I bless the sacrifice and invocation, and the [pg 359] good offering, the beneficent offering, the offering of assistance offered unto thee, O Ātar, son of Ahura Mazda! {#IV:7}

Thou art worthy of sacrifice and invocation; mayest thou receive the sacrifice and the invocation in the houses of men.

Ātar looks at the hands of all those who pass by: 'What does the friend bring to his friend? What does he who comes and goes bring to him [^1552] who stays motionless?' {#IV:14}

We sacrifice unto Ātar, the valiant warrior [^1553].

And if the passer-by brings him wood holily brought, or bundles of baresma holily tied up, or [pg 361] twigs of Hadhānaēpata [^1554] then Ātar, the son of Ahura Mazda, well pleased with him and not angry, and fed as required, will thus bless him: {#IV:15}

'May herds of oxen grow for thee, and increase of sons; may thy mind be master of its vow, may thy soul be master of its vow, and mayest thou live on in the joy of the soul all the nights of thy life.' {#IV:16}

This is the blessing which Ātar speaks unto him who brings him dry wood, well-examined by the light of the day, well-cleansed with godly intent [^1555].

_Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . ._ {#IV:17}
