## I. ORMAZD YAŚT.


_[^99]. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! May Angra Mainyu be destroyed! by those who do truly what is the foremost wish (of God [^100])._ {#I:0}

_I praise well-thought, well-spoken, and well-done thoughts, words, and deeds. I embrace all good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; I reject all evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds._

_I give sacrifice and prayer unto you, O Amesha-Speṇtas! even with the fulness of my thoughts, of my words, of my deeds, and of my heart: I give unto you even my own life [^101]._

_I recite the 'Praise of Holiness [^102]:'_

_'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good. Well is it for it, well is it for that holiness which is perfection of holiness!'_

_I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathuśtra, one who hates the Daēvas and obeys the laws of Ahura [^103];_ [pg 23] _For sacrifice [^104], prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hāvani\] [^105], the holy and master of holiness;_

_For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Sāvanghi and Vīsya\] [^106], the holy and masters of holiness;_

_For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto the Masters of the days, of the periods of the day, of the months, of the seasons, and of the years [^107];_

Unto AHURA MAZDA, bright and glorious, be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

_Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness: the riches of Vohū-Manō shall be given to him who works in this world for Mazda, and wields according to the will of Ahura the power he gave him to relieve the poor._

Zarathuśtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! {#I:1}

'What of the Holy Word is the strongest? What is the most victorious? What is the most glorious? What is the most effective?

'What is the most fiend-smiting? What is the best-healing? What destroyeth best the malice of Daēvas and Men? What maketh the material world best come to the fulfilment of its wishes [^108]? What freeth the material world best from the anxieties of the heart [^109]?' [pg 24] 3\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Our Name, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! who are the Amesha-Speṇtas, that is the strongest part of the Holy Word; that is the most victorious; that is the most glorious; that is the most effective; {#I:2}

'That is the most fiend-smiting; that is the best-healing; that destroyeth best the malice of Daēvas and Men; that maketh the material world best come to the fulfilment of its wishes; that freeth the material world best from the anxieties of the heart.' {#I:4}

Then Zarathuśtra said: 'Reveal unto me that name of thine, O Ahura Mazda! that is the greatest, the best, the fairest, the most effective, the most fiend-smiting, the best-healing, that destroyeth best the malice of Daēvas and Men; {#I:5}

'That I may afflict all Daēvas and Men; that I may afflict all Yātus and Pairikas [^110]; that neither Daēvas nor Men may be able to afflict me; neither Yātus nor Pairikas.' {#I:6}

Ahura Mazda replied unto him: 'My name is the One of whom questions are asked [^111], O holy Zarathuśtra! {#I:7}

'My second name is the Herd-giver [^112].

'My third name is the Strong One [^113].

[pg 25]

'My fourth name is Perfect Holiness [^114].

'My fifth name is All good things created by Mazda, the offspring of the holy principle. 'My sixth name is Understanding [^115];

'My seventh name is the One with understanding.

'My eighth name is Knowledge;

'My ninth name is the One with Knowledge.

'My tenth name is Weal; {#I:8}

'My eleventh name is He who produces weal.

'My twelfth name is AHURA (the Lord) [^116].

'My thirteenth name is the most Beneficent.

'My fourteenth name is He in whom there is no harm [^117].

'My fifteenth name is the unconquerable One.

'My sixteenth name is He who makes the true account [^118].

'My seventeenth name is the All-seeing One.

'My eighteenth name is the healing One.

'My nineteenth name is the Creator.

My twentieth name is MAZDA (the All-knowing One).

'Worship me, O Zarathuśtra, by day and by [pg 26] night, with offerings of libations well accepted [^119]. I will come unto thee for help and joy, I, Ahura Mazda; the good, holy Sraosha will come unto thee for help and joy; the waters, the plants, and the Fravashis of the holy ones will come unto thee for help and joy. {#I:9}

'If thou wantest, O Zarathuśtra, to destroy the malice of Daēvas and Men, of the Yātus and Pairikas, of the oppressors, of the blind and of the deaf [^120], of the two-legged ruffians [^121], of the two-legged Ashemaoghas [^122], of the four-legged wolves; {#I:10}

And of the hordes with the wide front, with the many spears [^123], with the straight spears, with the spears uplifted, bearing the spear of havock; then, recite thou these my names every day and every night.

[pg 27]

'I am the Keeper [^124] I am the Creator and the Maintainer [^125]; I am the Discerner [^126]s; I am the most beneficent Spirit. {#I:12}

'My name is the bestower of health; my name is the best bestower of health.

'My name is the Āthravan [^127]; my name is the most Āthravan-like of all Āthravans.

'My name is Ahura (the Lord).

'My name is Mazdāu (the all-knowing).

'My name is the Holy; my name is the most Holy.

'My name is the Glorious; my name is the most Glorious.

'My name is the Full-seeing; my name is the Fullest-seeing.

'My name is the Far-seeing; my name is the Farthest-seeing.

'My name is the Protector; my name is the Well-wisher; my name is the Creator; my name is the Keeper; my name is the Maintainer. {#I:13}

'My name is the Discerner; my name is the Best Discerner.

'My name is the Prosperity-producer [^128]; my name is the Word of Prosperity [^129].

'My name is the King who rules at his will; [pg 28] my name is the King who rules most at his will.

'My name is the liberal King [^130]; my name is the most liberal King.

'My name is He who does not deceive; my name is He who is not deceived. {#I:14}

'My name is the good Keeper; my name is He who destroys malice; my name is He who conquers at once; my name is He who conquers everything; my name is He who has shaped everything [^131].

'My name is All weal; my name is Full weal; my name is the Master of weal.

'My name is He who can benefit at his wish; my name is He who can best benefit at his wish. {#I:15}

'My name is the Beneficent One; my name is the Energetic One; my name is the most Beneficent.

'My name is Holiness; my name is the Great One; my name is the good Sovereign; my name is the Best of Sovereigns.

'My name is the Wise One; my name is the Wisest of the Wise; my name is He who does good for a long time.

'These are my names. {#I:16}

'And he who in this material world, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! shall recite and pronounce those names of mine [^132] either by day or by night; [pg 29] 17\. 'He who shall pronounce them, when he rises up or when he lays him down; when he lays him down or when he rises up; when he binds on the sacred girdle [^133] or when he unbinds the sacred girdle; when he goes out of his dwelling-place, or when he goes out of his town, or when he goes out of his country and comes into another country;

'That man, neither in that day nor in that night, shall be wounded by the weapons of the foe who rushes Aēshma-like [^134] and is Druj-minded; not the knife, not the cross-bow, not the arrow, not the sword, not the club, not the sling-stone [^135] shall reach and wound him. {#I:18}

'But those names shall come in to keep him from behind and to keep him in front [^136], from the Druj unseen, from the female Varenya fiend [^137], from the evil-doer [^138] bent on mischief [^139], and from that fiend who is all death, Angra Mainyu. It will be as if there were a thousand men watching over one man [^140]. {#I:19}

' "Who is he who will smite the fiend in order to maintain thy ordinances? Teach me clearly thy [pg 30] rules for this world and for the next, that Sraosha may come with Vohu-Manō and help whomsoever thou pleasest [^141]." {#I:20}

'Hail to the Glory of the Kavis [^142]! Hail to the Airyanem Vaējah [^143]! Hail to the Saoka [^144], made by Mazda! Hail to the waters of the Dāitya [^145]! Hail to Ardvi [^146], the undefiled well! Hail to the whole world of the holy Spirit! {#I:21}

'Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord . . . . [^147]

'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good. . . . [^148]

'We worship the Ahuna Vairya [^149]. We worship Asha-Vahiśta, most fair, undying, and beneficent [^150]. We worship Strength and Prosperity and Might and Victory and Glory and Vigour [^151]. We worship Ahura Mazda, bright and glorious. {#I:22}

'Yēnghē hātãm [^152]: All those beings [^153] of whom Ahura Mazda knows the goodness [^154] for a sacrifice [pg 31] \[performed\] in holiness, all those beings, males [^155] and females [^156], do we worship.

'Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . . {#I:23}

'I bless the sacrifice and the prayer unto Ahura Mazda, bright and glorious, and his strength and vigour [^157]

(Bahman Yaśt [^158].)

'O Zarathuśtra! keep thou for ever that man who is friendly \[to me\] from the foe unfriendly \[to me\]! Do not give up that friend unto the stroke (of the foe), unto vexations to be borne; wish no harm unto that man who would offer me a sacrifice, be it ever so great or ever so small, if it has reached unto us, the Amesha-Speṇtas. {#I:24}

'Here is Vohu-Manō, my creature, O Zarathuśtra! here is Asha-Vahiśta, my creature, O Zarathuśtra! here is Khśathra-Vairya, my creature, O Zarathuśtra! here is Speṇta-Ārmaiti, my creature, O Zarathuśtra! here are Haurvatāṭ and Ameretāṭ, who are the reward of the holy ones [^159], when freed from their bodies, my creatures, O Zarathuśtra! {#I:25}

'Thou knowest this, and how it is, O holy Zarathuśtra! from my understanding and from my knowledge; namely, how the world first began [^160], and how it will end [^161]. {#I:26}

[pg 32]

'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies [^162]!

'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies!

'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies!

'\[We worship\] the well-shapen, tall-formed Strength; Verethraghna, made by Ahura; the crushing Ascendant [^163], and Speṇta-Ārmaiti. {#I:27}

'And with the help of Speṇta-Ārmaiti, break ye [^164] asunder their [^165] malice, turn their minds astray, bind their hands, make their knees quake against one another, bind their tongues [^166]. {#I:28}

'When, O Mazda! shall the faithful smite the wicked [^167]? When shall the faithful smite the Druj? When shall the faithful smite the wicked?'

Then Zarathuśtra said: 'I threw you back into the earth [^168], and by the eyes of Speṇta-Ārmaiti  [^169] the ruffian was made powerless [^170]. {#I:29}

'We worship the powerful Gaokerena [^171], made by Mazda; the powerful Gaokerena, made by Mazda. {#I:30}

'We worship the memory of Ahura Mazda, to keep the Holy Word. {#I:31}

'We worship the understanding of Ahura Mazda, to study the Holy Word.

'We worship the tongue of Ahura Mazda, to speak forth the Holy Word.

[pg 33]

'We worship the mountain that gives understanding, that preserves understanding [^172]; \[we worship it\] by day and by night, with offerings of libations well-accepted [^173].

'We worship that creation \[of Ahura's\], Speṇta-Ārmaiti; and the holy creations of that creature and of Asha \[Vahiśta\], that are foremost in holiness [^174]. {#I:32}

'Here I take as lord and master [^175] the greatest of all, Ahura Mazda; to smite the fiend Angra Mainyu to smite Aēśma of the wounding spear [^176]; to smite the Māzainya fiends 6; to smite all the Daēvas and the Varenya fiends [^177]; to increase Ahura Mazda, [pg 34] bright and glorious; to increase the Amesha-Speṇtas; to increase the star Tiśtrya [^178], the bright and glorious; to increase the faithful men; to increase all the holy creatures of the Beneficent Spirit.

'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good. . . . [^179]

'\[Give\] unto that man [^180] brightness and glory, give him health of body, give him sturdiness of body, give him victorious strength of body, give him full welfare of wealth, give him a virtuous [^181] offspring, give him long, long life, give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones [^182]. {#I:33}

'May it come according to my blessing [^183]!

'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies [^184]! (three times.)

'Come to me for help, O Mazda!

'We worship the well-shapen, tall-formed Strength, and Verethraghna, made by Mazda, and the crushing Ascendant [^185].

'We worship Rāma Hvāstra, and Vayu who works highly and is more powerful to destroy than all other creatures. That part of thee do we worship, O Vayu, that belongs to Speṇta Mainyu. We worship the sovereign Sky, the boundless Time, and the sovereign Time of the long Period [^186].

'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .'

[^98]: Translated by West (Pahlavi Texts, I).

[^99]: The formulas of this section serve as an introduction to all Yaśts.

[^100]: The last clause of this sentence is imitated from Yasna XLVI \[XLV\], 19: 'he who does truly in holiness what was the foremost wish of Zarathuśtra' (that is, what he ordered most earnestly; Pahl. Comm.).

[^101]: 'If I must give up my life for the sake of my soul, I give it up' (Pahl. Comm.). The two sentences, 'I praise . . . .,' 'I give unto you . . . .,' are taken from Yasna XI, 17, 18 \[XII\].

[^102]: The Ashem Vohū, one of the holiest and most frequently recited prayers.

[^103]: The Fravarānē or profession of faith of the Zoroastrian (Yasna L 23 \[65-68\]).

[^104]: He shows himself a Zoroastrian by offering sacrifice . . . .

[^105]: The actual Gāh during which the Yaśt is being recited must be mentioned here. Hāvani is the first Gāh (see Gāhs).

[^106]: The Genii who co-operate with Hāvani, his hamkārs; for each Gāh the names of its proper hamkārs should be mentioned (see Gāh s).

[^107]: See Vendīdād VIII, 19, text and notes.

[^108]: Pun mīnishn īt barā matārtūm, mandūm frārūn (Phl. tr.); manasas asti prāpakatarā (Sansk. tr.); ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/02300.jpg) (Pers. tr.).

[^109]: Pun akhū it barā mūshītārtūm: pīm(ī) u mandūm ī apārūn [pg 24] (Phl. tr.); vitarkāṇām asti mūshakatarā (Sansk. tr.); ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/02400.jpg) (Pers. tr.).

[^110]: See Vendīdād, Introd. IV, 20-21.

[^111]: As the revealer of the law, which is generally expounded by a process of questions from Zarathuśtra and answers from Ahura. The revelation itself is called speṇtō frasna, the holy questions' (Vendīdād XXII, 19).

[^112]: 'That is, I give herds of men and cattle' (Phl. tr.).

[^113]: 'Strong, that is, I have strength for the works of the law' (Phl. tr.); the Sanskrit translation has, 'powerful, that is, I have power to create.'

[^114]: Asha-Vahiśta, which is the name of the second Amesha-Speṇta too. The commentary has: 'That is, my own being is all holiness.'

[^115]: Literally: 'My sixth name is that I am Understanding.' The same construction is used with regard to the eighth, the tenth, and the nineteenth names.

[^116]: 'It follows from this passage that a man is not fit to be a king, unless he possesses twelve virtues' (Phl. tr.).

[^117]: 'Some say: I keep harm from man' (Phl. tr.).

[^118]: 'That is, I make the account of good works and sins' (Phl. tr.); prakaṭam gaṇanākaras kila puṇyapāpayos saṅkhyām aham karomi (Sansk. tr.). Cf. Yasna XXXII, 6, b.

[^119]: Yasō-bereta: prāptena dānena; ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/02600.jpg)

[^120]: The Kavis and the Karapans, the blind and the deaf, are those 'who cannot see nor hear anything of God.' Those terms were current in the theological language of the Sassanian times to designate the unbelievers. An edict, promulgated by king Yazdgard III (fifth century A.C.) to make Zoroastrism the state religion in Armenia, had the following words: 'You must know that any man who does not follow the religion of Mazda is deaf, blind, and deceived by Ahriman's devs' (Elisaeus, The War of Vartan).

[^121]: Or murderers (mairya); according to the Parsis highwaymen ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/02601.jpg)).

[^122]: The heretics. Casuists distinguish three kinds of Ashemaogha: the deceiver (frīftār), the self-willed (khōt dōshak), and the deceived (frīftak). The first and worst is one who knowingly leads people astray, making forbidden what is lawful, and lawful what is forbidden; the second is one who follows his own will and reason, instead of applying to a Dastūr (a spiritual guide) for direction; the third is one who has been led astray by another.

[^123]: Drafśa means also banner: the Persian ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/02602.jpg), derived from drafśa, has preserved the two meanings. The Sanskrit translation has śastra, the Persian has  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/02603.jpg).

[^124]: 'I keep the creation' (Phl. tr.).

[^125]: 'I created the world and I maintain it' (ibid.).

[^126]: I can know what is useful and what is hurtful' (ibid.).

[^127]: 'The priest.'

[^128]: 'I impart increase to the righteous' (Phl. tr.).

[^129]: Doubtful. Fśūśō-mãthrō is used in several passages as the name of a part of the Avesta, Yasna LVIII \[LVII\], which appears to be called so from the presence in it of the words fśūśa, fśūmaṇṭ, 'thriving, causing to thrive,' which aptly express its contents.

[^130]: Nāma, translated āpāt, and interpreted Khutāi rāt. The Sanskrit translator has misread āzāt for āpāt, and translated svatantra, independent.

[^131]: The commentator observes orthodoxly, 'everything good.'

[^132]: That is to say, who will recite this Yaśt.

[^133]: The aiwyāonghanem or kōsti (see Vendīdād XVIII, p. 191, note 4).

[^134]: Or 'with anger.'

[^135]: Akavō, cakavō, ishavō, kareta, vazra, translated kartari, cakra, śara, śastrikā, vajra.

[^136]: Min akhar u lūīn (Phl. tr.); pṛshṭha\[ta\]s purataśca (Sansk. tr.).

[^137]: Interpreted as the demon of lust and envy. Cf. Vendīdād, Introd. IV, 23.

[^138]: Kayadha, translated kāstār (Phl.), 'the impairer;' kadarthaka (Sansk.), 'he who holds for nothing, who makes slight of.'

[^139]: Doubtful. The Phl. tr. has 'who impairs living creatures,' etc.

[^140]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 71.

[^141]: From Yasna XLIV, 16; cf. Vendīdād VIII, 20.

[^142]: See Sīrōzah I, 9, [p. 7](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_7), note [2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#fn_40).

[^146]: Ardvi Sūra Anāhita, the great goddess of the waters; see Yt. V.

[^147]: See above, .

[^148]: See above, .

[^149]: The prayer yathā ahū vairyō, known as Ahuna vairya (Honover), from the first words in it: ahū vairyō. See above, .

[^150]: Or 'the fairest Amesha-Speṇta;' cf. Vend. Introd. IV, 7.

[^151]: Impersonated as gods, to obtain from them the benefits of which they are the impersonations.

[^152]: A formula found at the end of most chapters of the Yasna and imitated from Yasna LI \[L\], 22.

[^153]: The Amesha-Speṇtas (Pahl. Comm. ad Yasna XXVII, fin.).

[^154]: The benefits of which they dispose, and which they impart as rewards to the righteous.

[^155]: The first three.

[^156]: The last three, whose names are feminine.

[^157]: Which he will impart in return to his worshippers.

[^158]: See above, .

[^159]: As the Genii who preside over plants and waters, they are very likely entrusted with the care of feeding the righteous in Paradise. Cf. Yt. XXII, 18.

[^160]: From Yasna XXVIII, 12.

[^161]: Cf. Yasna XXX, 4.

[^162]: Yasna LXVIII, 15 (LXVII, 50).

[^163]: See Sīrōzah I, 20.

[^164]: Refers probably to the Izeds mentioned in the preceding paragraph.

[^165]: Of the foes alluded to § 24.

[^166]: Derezvan; see Yt. XI, 2.

[^167]: Cf. Yasna XLVIII \[XLVII\], 2.

[^168]: I follow the reading zamerena, which is followed by the Pahlavi translation too. In the Yasna IX, 15 (46) Zarathuśtra is said to have obliged the Daēvas to hide themselves in the earth.

[^169]: Cf. Yt. XIX, 94.

[^170]: Cf. Vend. IX, 12-13.

[^171]: See Sīrōzah I, 7.

[^172]: That mount is called in later literature Mount Ōśdāśtār (the Pahlavi translation of ushi-darena, the keeper of understanding). According to the Bundahiś (XII, 15), it stands in Seistan. High mountains, being nearer heaven, are apt to become in the spirit of mythology the seat of heavenly beings or treasures. It was on the top of a mountain that Ahura revealed the law (see Vd. XXII, 19 \[531); the first man and king, Gayomarth, ruled on a mountain and was called Gar-shāh, the king of the mountain. When the Kayanian family failed, the Iranians went to Mount Alborz and found there Kai Kobād waiting for his fate.

[^173]: The order of the text differs in one series of manuscripts, in which it begins with § 31; then comes § 29 with the following additional words:

    'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies! (three times; cf. above, § 26.)

    We worship the Fravashi of the man whose name is Asmō-hvanvaṇṭ; then I will worship the Fravashis of the other holy ones who were strong of faith' (Yt. XXII, 37).

    Asmō-hvanvaṇṭ was one of the first followers of Zarathuśtra, and with his name begins the enumeration of the Fravashis (Yt. XIII, 96).

    Then follows § 30, and then again § 31 with the Ashem Vohū: and then the additional passage, 'We worship . . . .,' is repeated twice.

[^174]: Vispērad XIX, 2.

[^175]: As ahu and ratu, that is, as temporal chief and spiritual guide.

[^178]: See Yaśt VIII.

[^179]: As above, .

[^180]: Who shall offer thee a sacrifice. This paragraph is taken from Yasna LXVIII, 11 (LXVII, 32), where it is addressed to the Waters: 'Ye, good waters, give unto that man who will offer you a sacrifice . . . .'

[^181]: Suśīla (Sansk. tr. ad Yasna LXI, 13).

[^182]: This clause serves as a conclusion to all Yaśts.

Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathuśtra, saying: 'That thou mayest increase Asha-Vahiśta, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! with hymns of praise, with performance of the office, with invocations, holy words, sacrifice, blessings, and adoration—once to abide in the shining luminous space, in the beautiful abodes [^223]—for the sacrifice and invocation of us, the Amesha-Speṇtas [^224]' . . . . {#III:1}

Zarathuśtra said: 'Say unto me the right words, such as they are, O Ahura Mazda! that I may increase Asha-Vahiśta, with hymns of praise, [pg 43] with performance of the office, with invocations, holy words, sacrifice, blessings, and adoration,—once to abide in the shining luminous space, in the beautiful abodes,—for the sacrifice and invocation of you, the Amesha-Speṇtas. {#III:2}

'(Easy is the way to the Garō-nmāna of Ahura Mazda): the Garō-nmāna is for the holy souls, and no one of the wicked can enter the Garō-nmāna and its bright, wide, holy ways; (no one of them can go) to Ahura Mazda. {#III:4}

'The Airyaman prayer [^228] smites down the strength of all the creatures of Angra Mainyu, of the Yātus and Pairikas [^229].

'One may heal with Holiness, one may heal with the Law, one may heal with the knife, one may heal with herbs, one may heal with the Holy Word: amongst all remedies this one is the healing one that heals with the Holy Word; this one it is that will best drive away sickness from the body of the faithful: for this one is the best-healing of all remedies [^230]. {#III:6}

'Sickness fled away \[before it\], Death fled away; the Daēva fled away, the Daēva's counter-work [^231] fled away; the unholy Ashemaogha [^232] fled away, the oppressor of men fled away. {#III:7}

[^220]: As above, Yt. I, 0.

[^221]: Sīrōzah I, 3.

[^222]: Several manuscripts add here the full invocation of the greater Sīrōzah:

    'We sacrifice unto Asha-Vahiśta, the fairest, the Amesha-Speṇta;
    We sacrifice unto the much-desired Airyaman;
    We sacrifice unto the instrument, made by Mazda;
    We sacrifice unto the good Saoka, with eyes of love, made by Mazda and holy.'

[^223]: The Garō-nmānem or Paradise; see Yasna XVI, 7 \[XVII, 42\], Phl. tr.

[^224]: The principal clause appears to be wanting, unless Zarathuśtra is supposed to interrupt Ahura. One might also understand the sentence in an optative sense: 'Mayest thou increase . . .'

[^225]: Here again it seems as if a paragraph had been lost: 'Ahura Mazda answered: Proclaim thou Asha-Vahiśta; if thou proclaimest Asha-Vahiśta . . . .—Then Zarathuśtra replied: I proclaim Asha-Vahiśta . . .'

[^226]: The Garōthmān.

[^227]: An allusion to the three Paradises of Humat, Hūkht, Hvarśt, through which the souls of the blessed pass to Garōthmān (Yt. XXII, 15).

[^228]: The prayer known as Airyama-ishyō; see Vendīdād XXI, 11-12.

[^229]: See Vend. Introd. IV, 20-21.

[^230]: Cf. Vendīdād VII, 44 (118). That Airyaman made use of the Holy Word (of spells) to cure diseases appears from Vend. XXII, 6 seq.

[^231]: Paityāra: every work of Ahura was opposed and spoiled by a counter-work of Angra Mainyu. Cf. Bundahiś I, 23 seq.; III, 23 seq.; Vend. I; see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 195 seq.

[^234]: The courtezan; cf. Vend. XXI, 27 (35), and Introd. IV, 25.

[^235]: The Zend is Kahvaredhaini, a synonym of which, Kahvaredha, Yasna LXI, 2 \[LX, 7\], is translated impairer of Glory, which means very likely: he who makes one 'dwindle, peak, and pine' (cf. Vend. XVIII, 62-64).

[^236]: From the country of hell; cf. Vend. VII, 2; XIX, 1; Yt. XXII, 25.

[^237]: One set of manuscripts insert: 'He will smite the wind that blows against the North, he will afflict the wind that blows against the North; the wind that blows against the North \[will perish\].' This is most likely an interpolation, as the wind that blows against the North (if this is the right meaning of aparō apākhtara, as opposed to pourvō apākhtara) blows against Angra Mainyu.

[^238]: Cf. Vendīdād VIII, 21.

[^239]: That is to say, worth being accepted: cf. Yt. X, 32; the Parsis translate, 'a sacrifice heard \[from the lips of the Dastūrs\]' ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/04700.jpg); East India Office, XXV, 42).

We sacrifice unto Haurvatāṭ, the Amesha-Speṇta; we sacrifice unto the prosperity of the seasons; we sacrifice unto the years, the holy and masters of holiness [^252].

Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathuśtra, saying: 'I created for the faithful the help, the enjoyments, the comforts, and the pleasures of Haurvatāṭ. We unite them with him who would come up to thee as one of the Amesha-Speṇtas, as he would come to any of the Amesha-Speṇtas, Vohu-Manō, Asha-Vahiśta, Khshathra-Vairya, Speṇta-Ārmaiti, Haurvatāṭ, and Ameretāṭ. {#IV:1}

'He who against the thousands of thousands of those Daēvas, against their ten thousands of ten thousands, against their numberless myriads would invoke the name of Haurvatāṭ, as one of the Amesha-Speṇtas, he would smite the Nasu, he would smite Haśi [^253], he would smite Baśi [^253], he would smite Saēni [^253], he would smite Būji [^253]. {#IV:2}

'How does the way of the faithful turn and part from the way of the wicked [^260]?' {#IV:5}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is when a man pronouncing my spell, either reading [^261] or reciting it by heart, draws the furrows [^262] and hides [^263] there himself, \[saying\]:

"I will smite thee, O Druj! whomsoever thou art, whomsoever thou art amongst the Drujes that come in an open way, whomsoever thou art amongst the Drujes that come by hidden ways, whomsoever thou art amongst the Drujes that defile by contact; whatsoever Druj thou art, I smite thee away from the Aryan countries; whatsoever Druj thou art, I bind thee; I smite thee down, O Druj! I throw thee down below, O Druj!" [pg 51] 7\. 'He draws \[then\] three furrows [^264]: I proclaim him one of the faithful; he draws six furrows [^264]: I proclaim him one of the faithful; he draws nine furrows [^264]: I proclaim him one of the faithful. {#IV:6}

'The names of those (Amesha-Speṇtas) smite the men turned to Nasus [^265] by the Drujes; the seed and kin of the deaf [^266] are smitten, the scornful [^267] are dead, as the Zaotar Zarathuśtra blows them away to woe [^268], however fierce, at his will and wish, as many as he wishes. {#IV:8}

'From the time when the sun is down he smites them with bruising blows; from the time when the sun is no longer up, he deals deadly blows on the Nasu with his club struck down, for the propitiation and glorification of the heavenly gods. {#IV:9}

'O Zarathuśtra! let not that spell be shown to any one, except by the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother from the same womb, or by the Āthravan to his pupil [^269] in black hair, devoted to the good law, who, devoted to the good law, holy [^270] and brave, stills all the Drujes [^271]. {#IV:10}

The Hukairya is mentioned again § 25 and Yt. IX, 8; Yt. X, 88; Yt. XV, 15; Yt. XVII, 28. It appears to be situated in the west (Bundahiś XXIV, 17; II, 7; Minokhired XLIV, 12).

[^290]: Cf. above, § 3.

[^291]: Cf. Vend. Introd. IV, 9, 40. This is the heavenly prototype of the Mazdean sacrifice as it was later shown to men by Zarathuśtra; cf. § 101.

[^293]: Cf. Yt. III, 18.

[^294]: Haoshyangha was the first king of the Paradhāta (Pēshdādyan) dynasty (cf. above, [p. 7](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_7), note [2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#fn_40), and Bundahiś XXXI, 1). It is related in Firdausi's Shāh Nāmah that he was the grandson of Gayomarth, the first man and king, and the son of Syāmak; that his father having been killed by the black Dīv, he encountered him at the head of an army of lions, tigers, birds, and Paris, and destroyed him; he then succeeded his grandfather, and reigned supreme over the seven Keshvars of the earth.

[^295]: Doubtful: upabda = upabanda, as thribda (Yt. VIII, 55) = thribanda; it appears from Yt. XV, 7 that the place meant here is the Taēra which is said in the Bundahiś (V, 7) to be surrounded by the Albōrz (the Hara).

[^296]: The Hara berezaiti or Albōrz, in Māzandarān, south of the Caspian Sea, was supposed to surround the earth; cf. Yt. X, 56.

[^297]: A formula frequently used, not only in the Avesta, but also in the Shāh Nāmah.

[^298]: The Daēvas in Māzandarān. Māzandarān was held a place of resort for demons and sorcerers, and was in the Iranian legend nearly the same as Ceylon is in the Rāmāyaṇa. The Damāvand mountain, to which Aži Dahāka was bound, is the southern boundary of Māzandarān.

[^299]: See Vend. Introd. IV, 23; cf. this Yaśt, § 33.

[^300]: Yima Khshaēta (Jemshīd), as an earthly king, ruled over the world for a thousand years, while he made immortality reign in it (Yt. IX, 8; XV, 15; cf. Vendīdād II, Introd.).

[^301]: See above, § 3.

[^302]: After his brother Takhma Urupa, who reigned before him, had been killed and devoured by Angra Mainyu (Yt. IV, 11, note).

[^303]: When Yima began to sin and lost the Hvarenō (Glory), he was overthrown by Aži Dahāka (Zohāk), who seized the power and reigned in his place for a thousand years (cf. Yt. XIX, 33 seq.).

    Aži Dahāka, literally 'the fiendish snake,' was first a mythical personage; he was the 'snake' of the storm-cloud, and a counterpart of the Vedic Ahi or Vṛtra. He appears still in that character in Yaśt XIX seq., where he is described struggling for the Hvarenō against Ātar (Fire), in the sea Vourukasha (Vendīdād, Introd. IV, 38; cf. this Yaśt, § 90). His struggle with Yima Khshaēta bore at first the same mythological character, 'the shining Yima' being originally, like the Vedic Yama, a solar hero: when Yima was turned into an earthly king, Aži underwent the same fate. In the Shāh Nāmah he is described as a man with two snakes springing from his shoulders: they grew there through a kiss of Ahriman's. For the myths referring to Aži, see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 91-95.

[^304]: Babylon (cf. Yt. XV, 19). The usurper Aži, being a non-Aryan, was identified with the hereditary foe, the Chaldæans: the name of Babylon united in it, at the same time, a dim historical record of the old Assyrian oppression, then shaken off and forgotten, and an actual expression of the national antipathy of the Iranians for their Semitic neighbours in Chaldæa. After the conquest of Persia by the Musulmans, Aži was turned at last into an Arab. The original seat of the Aži myths was on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea (Études Iraniennes, II, 210).

[^305]: Thraētaona (Ferīdūn), son of Āthwya, conquered Aži and bound him to Mount Damāvand, where he is to stay till the end of the world, when he shall be let loose and then killed by Keresāspa (Vendīdād, Introd. IV, 12, 18; Bauman Yaśt III, 55 seq.; Bund. XXIX, 8 seq.).

[^306]: Vīsō-puthra = Pahlavi barbītā (see Études Iraniennes, II, 139).

[^307]: Cf. Vend. I, 18 and Introd. IV, 12. Modern tradition supposes Varena to have been the region of Ghilan (very likely on account of its proximity to Māzandarān and Mount Damavand).

[^308]: See Yt. X, 82, note.

[^309]: Cf. Yt. XIX, 37.

[^310]: The two daughters of Yima, who had been ravished by Aži: they are called in the Shāh Nāmah Shahrināz and Arnavāz (see Études Iraniennes, II, 213, Savanghavāc et Erenavāc). Thraētaona delivered them, and then married them; he had a son, Airyu, from Arnavāz, and two sons from Shahrināz, Tura and Sairima; Airyu, Tura, and Sairima became the kings of Irān, Tūrān, and Rūm.

[^311]: Cf. Yt. IX, 14; XV, 24; XVII, 34.

[^312]: Keresāspa (Garshāsp), one of the greatest heroes in the Avestean romance, although Firdausi has all but passed him over in silence. See his feats, Yt. XIX, 38 seq.; cf. Yt. V, 2 7 seq.; Yasna IX, 10 (29); Vend. I, 10 (36).

[^313]: The Piśīn valley, south of Cabool. It was in the land of Cabool that the Keresāspa legend had its rise, or at least it was localised there. It is in the plain near the Piśīn valley that Keresāspa lies asleep, till the end of the world comes (see Yt. XIII, 61, note).

[^314]: A Parsi poem, of a very late date, gives further details about Gaṇdarewa. It was a monster who lived 'in the sea, on the mountain, and in the valley;' he was called Pāshnah zarah, because the sea did not go above his heel (a misinterpretation of his Avestean epithet zairi pāshna, golden-heeled, the Zend zairi being mistaken for the Persian zarah ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/06300.jpg), sea); his head would rise to the sun and rub the sky; he could swallow up twelve men at once. Keresāspa fought him for nine days and nine nights together; he drew him at last from the bottom of the sea and smashed his head with his club: when he fell on the ground, many countries were spoiled by his fall (Spiegel, Die traditionnelle Literatur der Parsen, P. 339, and West, Pahlavi Texts, II, pp. 369 seq.).

    In the Vedic mythology the Gandharva is the keeper of Soma, and is described now as a god, now as a fiend, according as he is a heavenly Soma-priest or a jealous possessor who grudges it to man. What was the original form of the myth in Mazdeism is not clear. In the Shāh Nāmah he appears as the minister of Aži Dahāka. Cf. Yt. XV, 27 seq., and Ormazd et Ahriman, pp. 99, note 5; 215, note 1.

[^315]: Frangrasyan (Afrāsyāb) was king of Tūrān for two hundred years. The perpetual struggle between Irān and Tūrān, which lasts to this day, was represented in the legend by the deadly and endless wars between Afrāsyāb and the Iranian kings from Minocihr down to Kai Khosrav (Kavi Husravah). The chief cause of the feud was the murder of Syāvakhsh (Syāvarshāna) by Afrāsyāb; Syāvakhsh, son of Kai Kaus (Kava Usa), having been exiled by his father, at the instigation of his mother-in-law, took refuge with Afrāsyāb, who received him with honour, and gave him his daughter in marriage: but the fortune of Syāvakhsh raised the jealousy of Afrāsyāb's brother, Karsīvaz (Keresavazda), who by means of calumnious accusations extorted from Afrāsyāb an order for putting him to death (see Yt. XIX, 77). Syāvakhsh was revenged by his son, Kai Khosrav, the grandson of Afrāsyāb (Yt. IX, 22).

[^316]: Haṇkanē: Firdausi speaks of a cave on the top of a mountain, near Barda (on the frontier of Adarbaijān), where Afrāsyāb, when defeated, took refuge, and was discovered by Kai Khosrav; that cave was called 'the cave of Afrāsyāb' (hang i Afrāsiāb; Shāh Nāmah, IV, 196). In an older form of the legend, that cave was a palace built under-ground, with walls of iron and a hundred columns: its height was a thousand times a man's size (Aogemaidē, § 61; cf. Bund. XII, 20: see etudes Iraniennes, II, 225, Le Hang d’Afrāsyāb).

[^317]: Yt. XIX, 56 seq.

[^318]: Kavi Usa (Kai Kaus), the son of Kavi Kavāta (Kai Kobād) and the father of Syāvakhsh (see , note [^315]), was the second king of the Kayanian dynasty.

[^319]: Mount Erezifya has been supposed to be the same as the Sariphi Montes in Ptolemaeus, which stretch between Margiana and Ariana (Burnouf, Commentaire sur le Yasna, p. 436).

[^320]: Kai Khosrav; cf. , notes [^315] and [^316].

[^321]: Doubtful.

[^322]: A lake in Adarbaijān, with salt water: fish cannot live in it (Bundahiś XXII, 2). It is the same as Lake Urumiah. Its name is miswritten in Firdausi (Khanjast for Kējast, ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/06600.jpg) for  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/06601.jpg)).

[^323]: Doubtful; see Études Iraniennes, II, uruyāpa, p. 179.

[^324]: In pursuing his adversary.

[^325]: Doubtful (cf. Yt. XV, 32).

[^326]: The White Forest (ibid.).

[^327]: Aurvasāra (ibid.).

[^328]: Doubtful.

[^329]: Trying to flee and escape.

[^330]: Possibly, 'vieing in horses' (for the swiftness of the race): cf. Yt. XIX, 77.

[^331]: Tusa, in the Shāh Nāmah Tus; one of the most celebrated Pahlavans of Kai Khosrav; he was the son of king Naotara. (Nōdar).

[^332]: He offers not a full sacrifice, being on horseback.

[^333]: Not to be taken by surprise.

[^334]: Cf. Yt. X, II, 94, 114.

[^335]: Vaēsaka was the head of the Vīsah family, whose foremost member was Pīrān Vīsah, the clever and upright minister of Afrāsyāb, the Turanian Nestor; but his counsels were despised for the common ruin, and himself perished with all his sons in the war against Irān.

[^336]: Kangha was a town founded by Syāvarshāna, during his exile, in a part of the land of Khvārizm, which is described as an earthly paradise. This city was built on the top of a high mountain (Aṇtare-Kangha, Yt. XIX, 4). The Khshathrō-saoka castle is called in the Shāh Nāmah Kang dež, 'the fortress of Kangha;' and, possibly, Khshathrō-saoka is a mere epithet of dvarem, 'the castle of kingly welfare.'

[^337]: According to the Shāh Nāmah, Kang dež was stormed by Kai Khosrav himself.

[^338]: Cf. §§ 53-54.

[^339]: Doubtful (pourvō); perhaps 'the man of the primitive faith' (the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha; cf. Yt. XIII, 0, note): the sacrifice he offers is quite a Zoroastrian one (cf. §§ 17, 104, and note 2 to the latter).

[^340]: An allusion is made here to a myth, belonging to the Thraētaona cyclus, of which no other trace is found in the Avesta (except in Yt. XXIII, 4). It referred most likely to the time when [pg 69] Thraētaona, on his march to Bawri, the capital of Aži (cf. § 29), arrived at the Tigris (the Rangha); an angel then came and taught him magic to enable him to baffle the sortileges of Aži (Shah Nāmah). We have in this passage an instance of his talents as a wizard, and one which helps us to understand why Thraētaona is considered as the inventor of magic, and his name is invoked in spells and incantations (Hamzah Ispahanensis, p. 101; Anquetil, II, pp. 135 seq.). Cf. Yt. XIV, 40 and note.

[^341]: Urvīkhśna, a word of doubtful meaning.

[^342]: Cf. Yt. V, 78, 126.

[^343]: This clause is no doubt spurious here.

[^344]: Jāmāspa, the prime minister of Vīśtāspa (Kai Gūśtāsp), appears here in the character of a warrior, though generally he is described as a sage and a prophet (Yasna XLIX \[XLVIII\], 9; LI \[L\], 8; Zardūśt Nāmah; yet cf. Yt. XXIII, 2). The Shāh Nāmah has an episode which recalls this one, although very different in its spirit, and more in accordance with the general character of Jāmāspa. At the moment when the two armies meet together, Gūśtāsp asks Jāmāsp to reveal to him the issue of the encounter: Jāmāsp obeys reluctantly, as the issue is to be fatal to the Iranians. Jāmāsp belonged to the Hvōva family.

[^345]: Or, 'as all the rest of the Aryans together.'

[^346]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 112. Ashavazdah, the son of Pourudhākhśti, is one of the immortals who will come forth to help Saoshyaṇṭ in the final struggle (Bundahiś XXIX, 6; Yt. XIX, 95).

[^347]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 113.

[^348]: Cf. above, [p. 6](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_6), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#fn_28).

[^349]: A Turanian tribe, Yt. XIII, 37-38.

[^350]: Asabana is very likely an epithet; possibly, 'who kills with a stone' (asan-ban); the sling was, as it seems, the favourite weapon of the Dānus (Yt. XIII, 38).

[^351]: This section is the only fragment left of the legend of Ashavazdah, which must have been an important one, since Ashavazdah is one of the immortals (Yt. XIX, 95).

[^352]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 102. Vistauru, being the son of Naotara, is the brother of Tusa, which identifies him with the Gustahm ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/07100.jpg)) in the Shāh Nāmah: Nōdar had two sons, Tus and Gustahm.

[^353]: A river not mentioned elsewhere.

[^354]: Cf. §§ 64, 226.

[^355]: Firdausi has no mention of this episode.

[^356]: Spurious.

[^357]: This legend is fully told in the Pahlavi tale of Gōśti Fryān (edited and translated by West): a sorcerer, named Akht, comes with an immense army to the city of the enigma-expounders, threatening to make it a beaten track for elephants, if his enigmas are not solved. A Mazdayasnian, named Gōśti Fryān, guesses the [pg 73] thirty-three riddles proposed by Akht; then, in his turn, he proposes him three riddles which the sorcerer is unable to guess, and, in the end, he destroys him by the strength of a Nīrang. Cf. Yt. XIII, 220. This tale, which belongs to the same widespread cycle as the myth of Oedipus and the Germanic legend of the Wartburg battle, is found in the Zarathuśtra legend too (Vendīdād XIX, 4).

[^358]: Perhaps an affluent of the Rangha (cf. Yt. XIII, 29, 29; XV, 27).

[^359]: Between the earth and the region of infinite light there are three intermediate regions, the star region, the moon region, and the sun region. The star region is the nearest to the earth, and the sun region is the remotest from it. Ardvi Sūra has her seat in the star region (Yasna LXV \[LXIV\], 1; Phl. tr.); cf. Yt. V, 132.

[^360]: The warriors.

[^361]: To teach.

[^362]: Doubtful.

[^363]: When the beds of the rivers are dry, the cause is that Ardvi Sūra sends up her waters to the higher heavens (to the sun region) instead of sending them down to the earth (cf. , note [^359]).

[^364]: The serpent, Aži, is here Aži in his original naturalistic character, the storm-fiend (cf. Vend. Introd. IV, 38 and this Yaśt, § 29, note). The uncleanness and unhealthiness of the rivers are ascribed to his poison.

[^365]: Arethna, an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον.

[^366]: Vawžaka, idem.

[^367]: Varenva, idem.

[^368]: Varenva poisons.

[^369]: Cf. Vend. II, 29.

[^370]: ? Ranghāu.

[^371]: Which incapacitate one for religious works.

[^372]: Cf. Vend. II, 29.

[^373]: Cf. Vend. VII, 79 and note 2; cf. above, § 91.

[^374]: For joy. The translations of those several words are not certain.

[^375]: Doubtful.

[^376]: Perhaps, those cups (yamāu).

[^377]: Filled up from § 94.

[^378]: The text here has vīspō-vahmem, 'worthy of all prayer;' the reading vīspō-vaēmem from Yt. XII, 24 seems to be better.

[^379]: Cf. §§ 102, 121.

[^380]: Cf. §§ 4, 102, 121.

[^381]: The Hvōva or Hvōgva family plays as great a part in the religious legend, as the Naotara family in the heroic one. Two of the Hvōvas, Frashaośtra and Jāmāspa, were among the first disciples of Zarathuśtra and the prophet married Frashaośtra's daughter, Hvōgvi (cf. Yt. XIII, 139). For the Naotaras, see above, §§ 53, 76. According to the Bundahiś, Vīśtāspa did not belong to the Naotara family (XXXI, 28): perhaps he was considered a Naotaride on account of his wife Hutaosa, who was one (Yt. XV, 35).

[^382]: His very name means 'He who has many horses.'

[^383]: Spurious.

[^384]: Cf. § 4.

[^385]: Cf. § 96.

[^386]: Cf. § 17. It is to be noticed that only Ahura and Zarathuśtra (and perhaps Vafra Navāza; see , note [^339]) offer the pure Zoroastrian sacrifice.

[^387]: Called Lōhrāsp in Parsi tradition.

[^388]: Cf. § 18. The conversion of Vīśtāspa by Zarathuśtra is the turning-point in the earthly history of Mazdeism, as the conversion of Zarathuśtra by Ahura himself is in its heavenly history. Cf. Yt. XXIV and IX, 26.

[^389]: Berezaidhi, translated buland (Yasna LVII, 11 \[LVI, 5, 2\]).

[^390]: See Yt. XIII, 99; V, 98, 105.

[^391]: A lake in Seistan (Bundahiś XXII, 5); from that lake will rise Hōshēdar Bāmī (Ukhshyaṭ-ereta), the first of the three sons of Zarathuśtra, not yet born (Bahman Yaśt III, 13; cf. Yt. XIII, 98).

[^392]: Of these three, Arejaṭ-aspa alone is known to Firdausi; he is the celebrated Arjāsp, who waged a deadly war against Gūśtāsp to suppress the new religion: he stormed Balkh, slaughtered Lōhrāsp and Zartūśt (Zarathuśtra), and was at last defeated and killed by Gūśtāsp's son, Isfendyār. He is the Afrāsyāb of the Zoroastrian period. In the Avesta he is not called a Turanian (Tura), but a Hvyaona; see Yt. IX, 30.

[^393]: Zarīr in Firdausi, the brother of Vīśtāspa; cf. Yt. V, 117; XIII, 101.

[^394]: The Araxes (Vendīdād I, 3).

[^395]: Doubtful (cf. Vend. III, 36 seq.).

[^396]: This is perhaps an epithet to Peshō-Kangha, 'the most malicious.'

[^397]: See , note [^392].

[^398]: If we may trust the Shāh Nāmah, she did not grant her favour to the last, as Zarīr was killed by one of the generals of Arjāsp, Bīdirafsh.

[^399]: A brother of Arjāsp's: his name is slightly altered in Firdausi (Andarīmān miswritten for Vandarīmān, ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/08000.jpg) for  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/08001.jpg).); see Études Iraniennes, p. 228).

[^400]: The text has the singular here and in the rest of the sentence: the names of the two brothers form a sort of singular dvandva; cf. Franghrasyanem Keresavazdem (Yt. XIX, 77); Ashavazdanghō Thritahē (Yt. XIII, 113; and same Yaśt, 115), and in the present passage Vīśtāspō Zairivairiś (see Études Iraniennes, II, 229).

[^401]: Both were killed by Isfendyār (Shāh Nāmah).

[^402]: Mīśti translated hamēśak, sadā (Yt. VII, 4).

[^403]: § 121 = §§ 96, 102.

[^404]: Paitidāna, a mantle, a tunic (Vend. XIV, 9 \[28\]).

[^405]: See §§ 8, 11.

[^406]: Cf. §§. 64, 78.

[^407]: Zaośa; cf. § 7, note 2.

[^408]: Doubtful (sispemna, from ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/08300.jpg)).

[^409]: Doubtful.

[^410]: Gems.

[^411]: ? Anupōithwaitim.

[^412]: ? Ratha; the usual meaning of ratha is 'a chariot;' perhaps the round shape of the chest of a chariot is meant.

[^413]: Possibly otter, Vend. XIV.

[^414]: Doubtful.

[^415]: Cf. Yt. XVII, 7.

[^416]: The translation of the last clause is doubtful.

[^417]: A good horse and a good driver.

[^418]: Cf. §§ 85, 88.

[^433]: Bahman is 'good thought, good mind,' Vohu-Manō; in the Vedas the moon is said to have been made out of the mind (manas) of Puruśa. For an explanation of that old mystical myth, see Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 74, note 3.

[^439]: When the moon allows itself to be perceived.

[^440]: The Pahlavi translation has the following interesting details: 'For fifteen days they take good deeds from the earthly creatures and the rewards for virtue from the heavens; for fifteen days they make the rewards pass to the earth and the good deeds pass to the heavens.' The moon is thus a sort of moral clearing-house between earth and heaven.

[^441]: According to the Parsis this waning does not refer to the moon, but to the constellations that help it in the struggle against the planets, which are supposed to belong to the Ahrimanian world (see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 223-226): 'while it waxes—namely, the moon—they wane,—namely, those that are opposed to the planets, to the bad stars; for instance, Haftōiring, Vanaṇḍ, Tiśtar, Satvēs; . . . . while it wanes—namely, the moon—they wax, that is to say, they are strong for doing good.' Thus the moon and the stars relieve each other in the battle against Ahriman.

[^448]: New moon and full moon are not used here in the English meaning: the month was divided into six parts, of five days each (the Norse fimt or five days’ week; see Vigfusson, Icelandic Dictionary, s. v.): the first five days (pancak fartūm) formed the new moon or aṇtare-māungha, literally 'the moon within;' the next five days (pancak datīgar) formed the perenō-māungha, literally 'the moon full,' which in fact partly answered to our first quarter; the next five days (pancak sitīgar), belonging to the full moon, were called the Vīshaptatha; no mention is made of the last three pancak, forming the second half of the month. It may be they were not mentioned, as belonging to the waning period, when the powers of the moon are suffering an eclipse. Cf. Neriosengh to Yasna I, (23.)

' "If men had worshipped me with a sacrifice in which I had been invoked by my own name, as they worship the other Yazatas with sacrifices in which they are invoked by their own names, I should have taken to me the strength of ten horses, the strength of ten camels, the strength of ten bulls, the strength of ten mountains, the strength of ten rivers [^491]." {#VIII:24}

[^468]: Mainivasāu = mainyu-asāu (meaning pun mīnōī jīvākīh, svargasthānam, Yasna LVII, 27 \[LVI, 11, 3\]).

[^469]: Erekhsha khshviwi-ishuś, in Pahlavi Ariś Shīvātīr (see Études Iraniennes, II, 220), or 'Ariś of the swift arrow,' was the best archer in the Iranian army. When Minocihr and Afrāsyab determined to make peace and to fix the boundary between Irān and Tūrān, 'it was stipulated that Ariś should ascend Mount Damāvand, and from thence discharge an arrow towards the east; and that the place in which the arrow fell should form the boundary between the two kingdoms. Ariś thereupon ascended the mountain, and discharged towards the east an arrow, the flight of which continued from the dawn of day until noon, when it fell on the banks of the Jihūn (the Oxus),' (Mirkhond, History of the Early Kings of Persia, trans. by David Shea, p. 175; cf. Noeldeke, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, 1881, p. 445.)

[^470]: Mount Khshaotha seems to be the same as Mount Damāvand (see preceding note); Mount Hvanvaṇṭ may be the same as Mount Bāmīān, from which the Balkh river springs, as according to Tabari (trans. by Noeldeke, l. l.), Ariś’ arrow stopped at the Balkh river (an affluent of the Oxus). But it may be that the limits given refer to the course of Tiśtrya; cf. § 38, text and note.

[^471]: Doubtful. Shooting stars are alluded to. Mr. Geiger remarks that there is a swarm of shooting stars falling every year just at the time when Tiśtrya, in the European climate, is supposed to be most active, on the 10th of August.

[^472]: See above, [p. 66](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#page_66), note [3](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#fn_323).

[^473]: Satavaēsa is said to be the leader of the western stars (to be read southern stars, Bund. II, 7), and has in its protection the seas of the southern quarter (ibid. XIII, 12); the Satavaēsa sea is the Persian gulf.

[^474]: This seems to be an allusion to the tide in the Arabian sea (the sea Vouru-Kasha) and in the gulf of Oman, which, being a southern sea, is under the control of Satavaēsa (cf. preceding note and Vend. V, 18, note 1).

[^475]: At the right time of the year when rain is expected.

[^476]: Cf. §§ 23-24 and Yt. X, 54-55, 74.

[^477]: As Tiśtrya is the producer of the rain: Tiśtryēnyasca = Tistaratārakasya vṛshṭim; (Khorshēḍ Nyāyiś 8, Sansk. tr.).

[^478]: Tiśtrya; cf. , note [^513].

[^479]: Haptōiriṇga (Ursa Major) is the leader of the stars in the north (Bund. II, 7). It is 'entrusted with the gate and passage of hell, to keep back those of the nine, and ninety, and nine hundred, and nine thousand and nine myriad demons, and demonesses, and fairies (Pairikas) and sorcerers (Yātus) who are in opposition to the celestial sphere and constellations' (Minokhired XLIX, 15; tr. by Vest).

[^480]: Vanaṇṭ is the leader of the stars in the south (read west; Bund. II, 7). Cf. Yt. XX.

[^481]: To obtain . . . . This invocation is brought about by the very name of Vanaṇṭ, which means 'who smites, who overcomes.' The peculiar office of Vanaṇṭ is to keep the passes and gates of Mount Albōrz, around which the sun, the moon, and the stars revolve, and to prevent the Paris and Daēvas from cutting off and breaking the road of the sun (Minokhired XLIX, 12).

[^482]: 'I sacrifice to Tiśtar for (= to obtain) the soundness of the sight' (Khorshēḍ Nyāyiś 8, Pahl. tr.).

[^483]: The age of fifteen is the paradisiacal age in the Avesta (Yasna IX, 5 \[18\]).

[^484]: Gayō maratan. But the translation is doubtful; possibly 'as a first-rate man is.'

[^485]: Doubtful; cf. erezi, Yt. XIV, 29.

[^486]: Cf. Yt. V, 8.

[^487]: Cf. Vend. XIX, 37 (123).

[^488]: 'Tiśtar was converted into three forms, the form of a man and the form of a horse and the form of a bull. . . . as the astrologers say that every constellation has three forms' (Bund. VII, 4; tr. West). Tiśtrya promises his worshippers children (§ 15), oxen (§ 17), or horses (§ 19), according as he appears in the form of a man (§ 13), of a bull (§ 16), or of a horse (§ 18).

[^489]: A mile (Bundahiś XXVI, 1; tr. West, note 1).

[^493]: Adhavō; possibly 'the streams;' cf. Yt. V, 1, note 2. A month in the ancient Persian calendar, supposed to correspond to September-October, was called ādukani, which might, on that hypothesis, mean '(the month) that makes streams spring up.'

[^494]: Of which the representative is wheat (Bundahiś XXIV, 19.).

[^495]: Of which the representative is the summer vetch (ibid. 21).

[^496]: Cf. §18.

[^497]: 'The Aūsindōm mountain is that which, being of ruby, of the substance of the sky, is in the midst of the wide-formed ocean (the sea Vouru-Kasha),' (Bund. XII, 6; tr. West). Mount Aūsindōm receives its waters through a golden channel from the height Hukairya (cf. Yt. V, 3); from there one portion flows forth to the ocean for the purification of the sea, and one portion drizzles in moisture upon the whole of this earth, and all the creations of [pg 102] Aūharmazd acquire health from it, and it dispels the dryness of the atmosphere' (ibid. XIII, 5).

[^498]: Doubtful.

[^499]: Haoma opens the way for the waters from heaven, as being the foremost element in sacrifice (cf. § 24). For the same reason the Bundahiś numbers Vohu-Manō, 'Good Mind,' amongst the cooperators of Tiśtrya.

[^500]: See [p. 6](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_6), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#fn_28).

[^509]: Doubtful. Mount Hvanvaṇṭ, being situated in the sea Vouru-Kasha (as appears from Tiśtrya travelling towards that sea, § 38), seems to be the same with Mount Aūsindōm (§ 32).

Darius, the son of Hystaspes, also deprecates Dužyāirya in one of his inscriptions: 'May Ahura Mazda keep this country from the hostile host, from sterility (duśiyāra), from lying (disloyalty): may never the foreigner enter this country, nor the hostile host, nor sterility, nor lying' (Persepolis, H, 15).

'On a side of the chariot of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, stands a beautiful well-falling club, with a hundred knots, a hundred edges, that rushes forward and fells men down; a club cast out of red brass, of strong, golden brass; the strongest of all weapons, the most victorious of all weapons [^714].

Arezahi and Savahi are the western and the eastern Karshvare; Fradadhafshu and Vīdadhafshu are in the south; Vourubareśti and Vourujareśti are in the north; Hvaniratha is the central Karshvare.

[^642]: Cf. Yt. X, 55.

[^647]: Yaokhśti, the root of Persian nyōśidan, Pahlavi niyōkhśītan, to hear; one might be inclined to translate 'a thousand ears,' or 'a thousand hearings;' but the meaning of the word must have been rather more general, as Neriosengh translates it (praṇidhi, IX, 8 \[25\]).

[^652]: An allusion to a myth in which Mithra was described as an Indra delivering the cows carried away by a Vṛtra: Firmicus Maternus called him abactorem boum (De Errore Profan. Relig. V); Commodianus compares him with Cacus:

    'Vrtebatque boves alienos semper in antris
    Sicut et Cacus Vulcani filius ille.'

The words āgeurvayēiti and nighnē, 'he seizes, he beats,' are the words used of the priest laying the Haoma in the mortar and pounding it with the pestle (Yasna, X, 2 \[4-5\]). The Sind and the Rangha are thus compared with the two parts of the Hāvana, the land between is the Haoma, and Mithra's arms are the arms of the priest.

[^672]: Sanakē, an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον; opposed to the aodhas of the Rangha, Yt. XII, 19.

[^694]: Prayer follows Mithra in his career, rising and setting with him.

[^695]: Mithra.

[^696]: The translation of this sentence is conjectural.

[^697]: Thirty strokes with the Sraoshō-carana (upāzana; see Vend. Introd. V, 59); it is an expiation (ākayayaṇta) which purges them from their sins and makes them fit for offering a sacrifice to Mithra. One may find in this passage the origin of the painful trials through which the adepts of the Mithriac mysteries had to go before being admitted to initiation (οὐκ ἂν οὖν εἰς αὐτὸν δυνήσαιτό τις τελεσθῆναι, εἰ μὴ διά τινων βαθμῶν παρελθὼν τῶν κοάσεων δείξει ἑαυτὸν ὅσιον καὶ ἀπαθῆ.

_May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! . . . ._ {#XI:0}

_Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

_I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathuśtra, one who hates the Daēvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;_

_For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hāvani\], the holy and master of holiness . . . ._

Unto the holy, strong Sraosha, who is the incarnate Word, a mighty-speared and lordly god,

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

_Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . ._

[pg 160]

#### I.

We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed, fiend-smiting Sraosha, who makes the world increase, the holy and master of holiness. {#XI:1}

Good prayer, excellent prayer to the worlds [^735], O Zarathuśtra!

This it is that takes away the friendship of the fiend and fiends, of the he-fiend and of the she-fiend; it turns away in giddiness their eyes, minds, ears [^736], hands, feet, mouths, and tongues [^737]; as good prayer, without deceit and without harm, is Manly Courage [^738], and turns away the Druj [^739]. {#XI:2}

The holy Sraosha, the best protector of the poor, is fiend-smiting; he is the best smiter of the Druj. {#XI:3}

The faithful one who pronounces most words of blessing is the most victorious in victory; the Mãthra Speṇta takes best the unseen Druj away. The Ahuna Vairya [^740] is the best fiend-smiter among all spells; the word of truth is the fighter [^741] that is the best of all fiend-smiters.

The Law of the worshippers of Mazda is the truest giver of all the good things, of all those that are the offspring of the good principle; and so is the Law of Zarathuśtra.

And he who should pronounce that word [^742], O Zarathuśtra! either a man or a woman, with a mind all intent on holiness, with words all intent on [pg 161] holiness, with deeds all intent on holiness, when he is in fear either of high waters or of the darkness of a rainy night; {#XI:4}

Or at the fords of a river, or at the branching-off of roads;

Or in the meeting together of the faithful, or the rushing together of the worshippers of the Daēvas [^743];

Whether on the road [^744] or in the law [^745] he has to fear, not in that day nor in that night shall the tormenting fiend, who wants to torment him, prevail to throw upon him the look of his evil eye, and the malice of the thief [^746] who carries off cattle shall not reach him. {#XI:5}

Pronounce then that word, O Zarathuśtra! that word to be spoken [^747], when thou fall upon the idolaters [^748] and thieves and Daēvas rushing together. Then the malice of the wicked worshippers of the Daēvas, of the Yātus and their followers, of the Pairikas and their followers, will be affrighted and rush away. Down are the Daēvas! Down are the Daēva-worshippers, and they take back their mouths from biting [^749]. {#XI:6}

_For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hāvani\], the holy and master of holiness._

Unto the awful, overpowering Fravashis of the faithful; unto the Fravashis of the men of the primitive law [^810]; unto the Fravashis of the next-of-kin,

_Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification._

_Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness. . . ._

#### I.

Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathuśtra, saying: 'Do thou proclaim, O pure Zarathuśtra! the vigour and strength, the glory, the help and the joy that are in the Fravashis of the faithful, the awful and overpowering Fravashis; do thou tell how they come to help me, how they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis of the faithful [^811]. {#XIII:1}

'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathuśtra! I maintain that sky, there above, shining and seen afar, and encompassing this earth all around. {#XIII:2}

'It looks like a palace, that stands built of a [pg 181] heavenly substance [^812], firmly established, with ends that lie afar, shining in its body of ruby over the three-thirds (of the earth) [^813]; it is like a garment inlaid with stars, made of a heavenly substance, that Mazda puts on, along with Mithra and Rashnu and Speṇta-Ārmaiti, and on no side can the eye perceive the end of it. {#XIII:3}

'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathuśtra! I maintain Ardvi Sara Anāhita, the wide-expanding and health-giving, who hates the Daēvas and obeys the laws of Ahura, who is worthy of sacrifice in the material world, worthy of prayer in the material world; the life-increasing and holy, the flocks-increasing and holy, the fold-increasing and holy, the wealth-increasing and holy, the country-increasing and holy [^814]; {#XIII:4}

 [^815]. 'Who makes the seed of all males pure, who makes the womb of all females pure for bringing forth, who makes all females bring forth in safety, who puts milk in the breasts of all females in the right measure and the right quality; {#XIII:5}

'The large river, known afar, that is as large as the whole of all the waters that run along the earth; that runs powerfully from the height Hukairya down to the sea Vouru-Kasha. {#XIII:6}

'All the shores of the sea Vouru-Kasha are boiling over, all the middle of it is boiling over, [pg 182] when she runs down there, when she streams down there, she, Ardvi Sūra Anāhita, who has a thousand cells and a thousand channels; the extent of each of those cells, of each of those channels, is as much as a man can ride in forty days, riding on a good horse. {#XIII:7}

'From this river of mine alone flow all the waters that spread all over the seven Karshvares; this river of mine alone goes on bringing waters, both in summer and in winter. This river of mine purifies the seed in males, the womb in females, the milk in females’ breasts [^816]. {#XIII:8}

'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathuśtra! I maintain the wide earth made by Ahura, the large and broad earth, that bears so much that is fine, that bears all the bodily world, the live and the dead, and the high mountains, rich in pastures and waters; {#XIII:9}

'Upon which run the many streams and rivers; upon which the many kinds of plants grow up from the ground, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals [^817], and to help the faithful. {#XIII:10}

'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathuśtra! I maintain in the womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does not die from the [pg 183] assaults of Vīdōtu [^818], and I develop in it [^819] the bones, the hair, the . . . .  [^820], the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs. {#XIII:11}

'Had not the awful Fravashis of the faithful given help unto me, those animals and men of mine, of which there are such excellent kinds, would not subsist; strength would belong to the Druj, the dominion would belong to the Druj, the material world would belong to the Druj. {#XIII:12}

'Between the earth and the sky the immaterial creatures would be harassed by the Druj; between the earth and the sky the immaterial creatures would be smitten by the Druj; and never afterwards would Angra-Mainyu give way to the blows of Speṇta-Mainyu. {#XIII:13}

'Through their brightness and glory the waters run and flow forward from the never-failing springs; through their brightness and glory the plants grow up from the earth, by the never-failing springs; through their brightness and glory the winds blow, driving down the clouds towards the never-failing springs. {#XIII:14}

'Through their brightness and glory the females conceive offspring; through their brightness and glory they bring forth in safety; it is through their brightness and glory when they become blessed with children. {#XIII:15}

'Through their brightness and glory a man is born who is a chief in assemblies and meetings [^821], who listens well [^822] to the (holy) words, whom Wisdom [pg 184] holds dear [^823], and who returns a victor from discussions with Gaotema, the heretic [^824]. {#XIII:16}

'Through their brightness and glory the sun goes his way; through their brightness and glory the moon goes her way; through their brightness and glory the stars go their way.

'In fearful battles they are the wisest for help, the Fravashis of the faithful. {#XIII:17}

'The most powerful amongst the Fravashis of the faithful, O Spitama! are those of the men of the primitive law [^825] or those of the Saoshyaṇṭs [^826] not yet born, who are to restore the world. Of the Others, the Fravashis of the living faithful are more powerful, O Zarathuśtra! than those of the dead, O Spitama!

'And the man who in life shall treat the Fravashis of the faithful well, will become a ruler of the country with full power, and a chief most strong; so shall any man of you become, who shall treat Mithra well, the lord of wide pastures, and Arśtāṭ, who makes the world grow, who makes the world increase. {#XIII:18}

'Thus do I proclaim unto thee, O pure Spitama! the vigour and strength, the glory, the help, and the joy that are in the Fravashis of the faithful, [pg 185] the awful and overpowering Fravashis; and how they come to help me, how they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis of the faithful [^827].' {#XIII:19}

#### II.

Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathuśtra, saying: 'If in this material world, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! thou happenest to come upon frightful roads, full of dangers and fears, O Zarathuśtra! and thou fearest for thyself, then do thou recite these words, then proclaim these fiend-smiting words, O Zarathuśtra! {#XIII:20}

' "I praise, I invoke, I meditate upon, and we sacrifice unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful. We worship the Fravashis of the masters of the houses, those of the lords of the boroughs, those of the lords of the towns, those of the lords of the countries, those of the Zarathuśtrōtemas [^828]; the Fravashis of those that are, the Fravashis of those that have been, the Fravashis of those that will be; all the Fravashis of all nations [^829], and most friendly the Fravashis of the friendly nations; {#XIII:21}

' "Who maintain the sky, who maintain the waters, who maintain the earth, who maintain the cattle, who maintain in the womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does not die from the assaults of Vīdōtu, and develop in it the bones, the hair, the . . . ., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs [^830]; {#XIII:22}

' "Who are much-bringing, who move with [pg 186] awfulness, well-moving, swiftly moving, quickly moving, who move when invoked; who are to be invoked in the conquest of good, who are to be invoked in fights against foes, who are to be invoked in battles; {#XIII:23}

At once, wherever they come, we worship them, the good ones, the excellent ones, the good, the strong, the beneficent Fravashis of the faithful. They are to be invoked when the bundles of baresma are tied; they are to be invoked in fights against foes, in battles [^838], and there where gallant men strive to conquer foes. {#XIII:27}

[pg 187]

Mazda invoked them for help, when he fixed the sky and the waters and the earth and the plants; when Speṇta-Mainyu fixed the sky, when he fixed the waters, when the earth, when the cattle, when the plants, when the child conceived in the womb, so that it should not die from the assaults of Vīdōtu, and developed in it the bones, the hair, the . . . ., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs [^839]. {#XIII:28}

Speṇta-Mainyu maintained the sky, and they sustained it from below, they, the strong Fravashis, who sit in silence, gazing with sharp looks; whose eyes and ears are powerful, who bring long joy, high and high-girded; well-moving and moving afar, loud-snorting [^840], possessing riches and a high renown. {#XIII:29}

We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, who gallantly and bravely fight, causing havoc, wounding [^843], breaking to pieces all the malice of the malicious, Daēvas and men, and smiting powerfully in battle, at their wish and will. {#XIII:33}

You kindly deliver the Victory made by Ahura, and the crushing Ascendant, most beneficently, to those countries where you, the good ones, unharmed and rejoiced, unoppressed and unoffended, have been held worthy of sacrifice and prayer, and proceed the way of your wish. {#XIII:34}

#### VIII.

We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, of high renown, smiting in battle, most strong, shield-bearing and harmless to those who are true, whom both the pursuing and the fleeing invoke for help: the pursuer invokes [pg 189] them for a swift race, and for a swift race does the fleer invoke them; {#XIII:35}

Who give good glory to him who worships them with a sacrifice, as that man did worship them, the holy Zarathuśtra, the chief of the material world, the head of the two-footed race, in whatever struggle he had to enter, in whatever distress he did fear; {#XIII:41}

Who, when well invoked, enjoy bliss in the heavens; who, when well invoked, come forward from the heavens, who are the heads [^853] of that sky above, possessing the well-shapen Strength, the Victory made by Ahura, the crushing Ascendant, and Welfare [^854], the wealth-bringing, boon-bringing, holy, well fed, worthy of sacrifice and prayer in the perfection of holiness. {#XIII:42}

They shed Satavaēsa [^855] between the earth and the sky, him to whom the waters belong [^856], who listens to appeals and makes the waters flow and the plants grow up, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals [^857], and to help the faithful [^858]. {#XIII:43}

Satavaēsa comes down and flows between the earth and the sky, he to whom the waters belong, who listens to appeals and makes the waters and the plants grow up, fair, radiant, and full of [pg 191] light, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals, and to help the faithful. {#XIII:44}

#### XII.

We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful; with helms of brass, with weapons of brass, with armour [^859] of brass; who struggle in the fights for victory in garments of light, arraying the battles and bringing them forwards, to kill thousands of Daēvas. {#XIII:45}

When the wind blows from behind them [^860] and brings their breath unto men,

Then men know where blows the breath of victory: and they pay pious homage unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, with their hearts prepared and their arms uplifted. {#XIII:46}

It will be as if there were a thousand men watching over one man [^882]; {#XIII:71}

We worship the Fravashis of all the holy men and holy women whose souls are worthy of sacrifice [^1029], whose Fravashis are worthy of invocation. {#XIII:148}

We worship the Fravashis of all the holy men and holy women, our sacrificing to whom makes us good in the eyes of Ahura Mazda: of all of those we have heard that Zarathuśtra is the first and best, as a follower of Ahura and as a performer of the law.

We worship the spirit, conscience, perception, soul, and Fravashi [^1030] of men of the primitive law [^1031], of the first who listened to the teaching (of Ahura), holy men and holy women, who struggled for holiness [^1032]; we worship the spirit, conscience, perception, soul, and Fravashi of our next-of-kin, holy men and holy women, who struggled for holiness [^1032]. {#XIII:149}

We worship the men of the primitive law who will be in these houses, boroughs, towns, and countries; {#XIII:150}

We worship the men of the primitive law who have been in these houses, boroughs, towns, and countries;

We worship the men of the primitive law who are in these houses, boroughs, towns, and countries.

We worship the men of the primitive law [pg 229] in all houses, boroughs, towns, and countries, who obtained these houses, who obtained these boroughs, who obtained these towns, who obtained these countries, who obtained holiness, who obtained the Mãthra, who obtained the \[blessedness of the\] soul, who obtained all the perfections of goodness. {#XIII:151}

We worship Zarathuśtra, the lord and master of all the material world, the man of the primitive law; the wisest of all beings, the best-ruling of all beings, the brightest of all beings, the most glorious of all beings, the most worthy of sacrifice amongst all beings, the most worthy of prayer amongst all beings, the most worthy of propitiation amongst all beings, the most worthy of glorification amongst all beings, whom we call well-desired and worthy of sacrifice and prayer as much as any being can be, in the perfection of his holiness. {#XIII:152}

We worship this earth; {#XIII:153}

We worship those heavens;

We worship those good things that stand between (the earth and the heavens) and that are worthy of sacrifice and prayer and are to be worshipped by the faithful man.

We worship the souls of the wild beasts and of the tame [^1033]. {#XIII:154}

We worship the souls of the holy men and women, born at any time, whose consciences struggle, or will struggle, or have struggled, for the good.

[pg 230]

We worship the spirit, conscience, perception, soul, and Fravashi of the holy men and holy women who struggle, will struggle, or have struggled, and teach the Law, and who have struggled for holiness. {#XIII:155}

_Yēṇhē hātãm: All those beings to whom Ahura Mazda . . ._

_Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . ._

The Fravashis of the faithful, awful and overpowering, awful and victorious; the Fravashis of the men of the primitive law; the Fravashis of the next-of-kin; may these Fravashis come satisfied into this house; may they walk satisfied through this house! {#XIII:156}

May they, being satisfied, bless this house with the presence of the kind Ashi Vanguhi! May they leave this house satisfied! May they carry back from here hymns and worship to the Maker, Ahura Mazda, and the Amesha-Speṇtas! May they not leave this house of us, the worshippers of Mazda, complaining! {#XIII:157}

_Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . ._ {#XIII:158}

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of the awful, overpowering Fravashis of the faithful; of the Fravashis of the men of the primitive law; of the Fravashis of the next-of-kin.

_Ashem Vohū.: Holiness is the best of all good. . . ._

_\[Give\] unto that man [^1034] brightness and glory, . . . . give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones._

[^810]: The so-called paoiryō-ṭkaēsha: the primitive law is what 'is considered as the true Mazdayasnian religion in all ages, both before and after the time of Zaratūśt' (West, Pahlavi Texts, I, 242, note 1); cf. § 150.

[^811]: Cf. § 19.

[^812]: Reading mainyu-tāśtō; cf. Yt. X, 90,143, and in this very paragraph vanghanem mainyu-tāśtem.

[^813]: A division of the earth different from and older than the division into seven Karshvares; cf. Yasna XI, 7 \[21\]; this division was derived by analogy from the tripartite division of the universe (earth, atmosphere, and heaven).

[^814]: Yt. V, 1.

[^815]: §§ 5-8 = Yt. V, 2-5.

[^816]: §§ 4-8 = Yt. V, 1-5.

[^817]: There are five classes of animals: those living in waters (upāpa), those living under the ground (upasma = upa-zema), the flying ones (fraptarjat), the running ones (ravascarant), the grazing ones (cangranghāc); Vispērad I, 1 seq.; Yt. XIII, 74. The representatives of those several classes are the kar māhī fish, the ermine, the karśipt, the hare, and the ass-goat (Pahl. Comm. ad Visp. l. l.).

[^824]: Yō nāidhyanghō gaotemahē parō ayāu parśtōiṭ avāiti. This seems to be an allusion to controversies with the Buddhists or Gotama's disciples, whose religion had obtained a footing in the western parts of Iran as early as the second century before Christ. Nāidhyanghō means a heretic, an Ashemaogha (see Pahl. Comm. ad Yasna XXXIV, 8).

[^863]: The sixth and last Gāhambār (see Āfrīgān Gāhambār), or the last ten days of the year (10th-20th March), including the last five days of the last month, Sapendārmad, and the five complementary days. These last ten days should be spent in deeds of charity, religious banquets (jaśan), and ceremonies in memory of the dead. It was also at the approach of the spring that the Romans and the Athenians used to offer annual sacrifices to the dead; the Romans in February 'qui tunc extremus anni mensis erat' (Cicero, De Legibus, II, 21), the Athenians on the third day of the Anthesterion feast (in the same month). The souls of the dead were supposed to partake of the new life then beginning to circulate through nature, that had also been dead during the long months of winter.

[^864]: Perhaps: asking for help, thus.

[^865]: Frīnāṭ: who will pronounce the Āfrīn?

[^866]: To be given in alms to poor Mazdayasnians (ashō-dād).

[^867]: Asha-nasa: that makes him reach the condition of one of the blessed (ahlāyīh arzānīk, Vend. XVIII, 6 \[17\]): the Sanskrit translation has, 'that is to say, that makes him worthy of a great reward.'

[^868]: As in the invocations from § 87 to the end.

[^869]: An allusion to the formula: 'I sacrifice to the Fravashi of my own soul,' Yasna XXIII, 4 \[6\].

[^870]: Stāhyō: stutikaro (Sansk. tr.; cf. Ātash Nyāyiś, 10).

[^871]: §§ 49-52 are a part of the so-called Āfrīgān Dahmān (a prayer recited in honour of the dead); a Sanskrit translation of that Āfrīgān has been published by Burnouf in his Études zendes.

[^872]: In winter.

[^873]: Doubtful. The word is hvawrīra, which Aspendiārji makes synonymous with hvāpara, kind, merciful (Vispērad XXI \[XXIV\], 1).

[^874]: Bundahiś VI, 3.

[^875]: To keep the white Hōm there from the evil beings that try to destroy it (Minokhirad LXII, 28).

[^876]: See above, [p. 97](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2313.htm#page_97), note [4](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2313.htm#fn_479).

[^877]: Keresāspa lies asleep in the plain of Pēśyānsāi; 'the glory (far) of heaven stands over him for the purpose that, when Až-i-Dahāk becomes unfettered, he may arise and slay him; and a myriad guardian spirits of the righteous are as a protection to him' (Bundahiś XXIX, 8; tr. West).

[^878]: 'Zaratūśt went near unto Hvōv (Hvōgvi, his wife) three times, and each time the seed went to the ground; the angel Nēryōsang received the brilliance and strength of that seed, delivered it with care to the angel Anāhīḍ, and in time will blend it with a mother' (Bundahiś XXXII, 8). A maid, Eredaṭ-fedhri, bathing in Lake Kãsava, will conceive by that seed and bring forth the Saviour Saoshyaṇṭ; his two fore-runners, Ukhshyaṭ-ereta and Ukhshyaṭ-nemah, will be born in the same way of Srūtaṭ-fedhri and Vanghu-fedhri (Yt. XIII, 141-142).

[^879]: With alms.

[^886]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 10.

[^887]: There seems to be in this paragraph a distinction of five faculties of the soul, āsna, mana, daēna, urvan, fravashi. The usual classification, as given in this Yaśt, § 149, and in later Parsism (Spiegel, Die traditionelle Literatur der Parsen, p. 172), is: ahu, spirit of life (?); daēna, conscience; baodhō, perception; urvan, the soul; fravashi.

[^888]: The Fravashis, 'on war horses and spear in hand, were around the sky . . . . and no passage was found by the evil spirit, who rushed back' (Bund. VI, 3-4; tr. West).

[^889]: Cf. Ormazd et Ahriman, § 107.

[^890]: That is to say, after their different kinds (described in Yasna XXXVIII, 3, 5 \[7-9, 13-14\]; LXVIII, 8 \[LXVII, 15\]; and Bund. XXI).

[^891]: After their kinds (Bund. XXVII).

[^893]: The Vedic devayāna.

[^894]: Cf. Yt. XIX, 15, 17.

[^896]: At the hearth and the altar.

[^897]: See Yt. XI.

[^904]: Doubtful.

[^905]: The first man. On the myths of Gaya Maretan, see Ormazd et Ahriman, §§ 129-135.

[^907]: Doubtful.

[^908]: Cf. Yasna XXIX, 8.

[^909]: The divine Order, Asha.

[^910]: The wheel of sovereignty (?); cf. Yt. X, 67; this expression smacks of Buddhism.

[^911]: Who first pronounced the Ashem Vohū; cf. Yt. XXI.

[^912]: Material lord and spiritual master.

[^913]: The reciter of the Ashem Vohū.

[^914]: Cf. Vend. XIX, 46 \[143\].

[^915]: See Sīrōzah I, 9, note.

[^916]: Maidhyō-māungha was the cousin and first disciple of Zarathuśtra; Zarathuśtra's father, Pourushaspa, and Ārāsti were brothers (Bund. XXXII, 3); cf. Yasna LI \[L\], 19.

[^917]: Cf. [p. 33](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2306.htm#page_33), note [2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2306.htm#fn_173); Yt. XXII, 37.

[^918]: Another Parśaṭ-gāuś is mentioned § 126.

[^919]: Possibly, 'the holy falcon, praiser of the lord;' thus the Law was brought to the Var of Yima by the bird Karśipta (Vend. II, 42), who recites the Avesta in the language of birds (Bund. XIX, 16): the Saēna-bird (Sīmurgh) became in later literature a mythical incarnation of Supreme wisdom (see the Mantik uttair and Dabistān I, 55).

[^920]: Who was the first regular teacher, the first aēthrapaiti.

[^921]: 'By Zaratūśt were begotten three sons and three daughters; one son was Isaḍvāstar, one Aūrvataḍ-nar, and one Khūrshēḍ-cīhar; as Isaḍvāstar was chief of the priests he became the Mōbad of Mōbads, and passed away in the hundredth year of the religion; Aūrvataḍ-nar was an agriculturist, and the chief of the enclosure formed by Yim, which is below the earth (see Vend. II, 43 \[141\]); Khūrshēḍ-cīhar was a warrior, commander of the army of Pēshyōtanū, son of Viśtāsp (see Yt. XXIV, 4), and dwells in Kangdež; and of the three daughters the name of one was Frēn, of one Srīt, and of one Pōrucīst (see Yt. XIII, 139). Aūrvataḍ-nar and Khūrshēḍ-cīhar were from a serving (cakar) wife, the rest were from a privileged (pāḍakhshah) wife' (Bund. XXXII, 5-6; tr. West).

[^922]: According to Anquetil, 'the threefold seed of Spitama Zarathuśtra;' cf. above, § 62.

[^923]: The king of Bactra, the champion of Zoroastrism; cf. Yt. V, 98,108.

[^924]: Druja paurvaṇca, possibly, 'with the spear pushed forwards' (reading druca).

[^925]: Daēna, the religion.

[^926]: Cf. Yt. II, 15.

[^927]: A generic name of the people called elsewhere Varedhakas (Yt. IX, 31; XVII, 51) or Hvyaonas (ibid. and XIX, 87). The Hunus have been compared with the Hunni; but it is not certain that this is a proper name; it may be a disparaging denomination, meaning the brood (hunu = Sansk. sūnu; cf. Yt. X, 113).

[^928]: Zarīr, the brother of Vīśtāspa and son of Aurvaṭ-aspa (see Yt. V, 112). The ten following seem to be the names of the other sons of Aurvaṭ-aspa (Bund. XXXI, 29).

[^929]: Possibly the same with Pāt-Khosrav, a brother to Vīśtāspa in the Yāḍkār-ī Zarīrān, as Mr. West informs me.

[^930]: Gustahm, the son of Nodar; see Yt. V, 76. Strangely enough, Tusa is not mentioned here, unless he is the same with one of the preceding names: possibly the words 'the son of Naotara' (Naotairyāna) refer to all the four.

[^931]: Possibly Frashīdvard ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20600.jpg) (misspelt from a Pahlavi form Fraśānvard  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20601.jpg) (?); the Yāḍkār-ī Zarīrān, as Mr. West informs me, has  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20602.jpg) and  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20603.jpg)). Frashīdvard was a son of Guśtāsp: he was killed by one of Arjāsp's heroes and avenged by his brother Isfendyār (Speñtō-dāta). The following names would belong to his brothers: most of them contain the word Ātar, in honour of the newly-adopted worship of fire.

[^932]: Isfendyār, the heroic son of Gūśtāsp, killed by Rustem.

[^933]: In the Yāḍkār-ī Zarīrān, according to Mr. West, Bastvar, the son of Zairivairi, whose death he avenges on his murderer Vīdrafś. This makes Bastavairi identical with the Nastūr ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20700.jpg) of Firdausi (read Bastūr  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20701.jpg)).

[^934]: Kavārazem is the Gurezm of later tradition ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20702.jpg)), 'the jealous brother of Isfendyār, whom he slandered to his father and caused to be thrown into prison' (Burhān qāti’h). Firdausi (IV, 432) has only that he was a relation to Gūśtāsp:  ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/20703.jpg). See Études Iraniennes, II, 230.

[^935]: Who gave his daughter, Hvōvi, in marriage to Zarathuśtra (Yasna L \[XLIX\], 4, 17).

[^936]: See Yt. V, 68.

[^937]: Another brother to Frashaośtra (?).

[^938]: The son of Jāmāsp in the Shāh Nāmah is called Girāmī and Garāmīk-karḍ in the Yāḍkār-ī Zarīrān.

[^939]: ? Aoiwra.

[^940]: Aēthrapati, in Parsi hērbad, a priest, whose special function is to teach; his pupils were called aēthrya. Aēthrapati meant literally 'the master of the hearth' (cf. hērkodah, fire-temple). Hamidhpati is literally 'the master of the sacrificial log.'

[^941]: Doubtful.

[^942]: No temporal lord (ahu) and no spiritual master (ratu).

[^943]: Doubtful (avascasta-fravashinãm).

[^944]: The evil done by Zoroastrians. This Mãthravāka ('Proclaimer [pg 209] of the Holy Word') was apparently a great doctor and confounder of heresies.

[^945]: See above, § 95.

[^946]: Possibly the eponym of that great Kāren family, which played so great a part in the history of the Sassanian times, and traced its origin to the time of Gūśtāsp (Noeldeke, Geschichte der Perser zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 437).

[^947]: Cf. Yt. V, 64.

[^948]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 99.

[^949]: Amru and Camru are apparently the two mythical birds mentioned above under the names of Sīn-amru (the Amru-falcon) and Cãmrōś ([p. 173](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2317.htm#page_173), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2317.htm#fn_795)).

[^950]: Mr. West compares Ashāvanghu, the son of Bivaṇdangha, and Jarōdanghu, the son of Pairiśtīra, with the two high-priests of the Karshvares of Arezahi and Savahi, whose names are, in the [pg 211] Bundahiś, Ashāshagahaḍ-ē Hvaṇdcān and Hoazarōdathhri-ē Parēśtyarō (Bund. XXIX, 1, notes 4 and 5).

[^951]: Saoshyaṇṭ; cf. §§ 117, 128.

[^952]: Possibly, 'the holy Hãm-baretar vanghvãm, the son of Takhma.' His name means, 'the gatherer of good things.'

[^953]: This name means, 'the praiser of excellent holiness' (the reciter of the Ashem Vohū).

[^954]: See preceding paragraph.

[^955]: One of the seven immortals, rulers in Hvaniratha; cf. Yt. V, 72, text and notes, and Yt. XIII, 120, 124.

[^956]: See preceding paragraph.

[^957]: See Yt. V, 72. The text has 'the Fravashi;' cf. Yt. V, 116, note, and Yt. XIII, 115.

[^958]: Cf. Yt. XIII, 143. Possibly, the son of Tūra.

[^959]: Cf. § 112.

[^960]: There are two men of this name; one is the son of Katu (§ 114), the other is the son of Avāraośtri (§ 104).

[^961]: The text has 'the Fravashi;' cf. preceding page, note [^957].

[^962]: See § 105.

[^963]: Saoshyaṇṭ; cf. §§ 110, 128.

[^964]: Perhaps, Ukhshan, the conqueror of glory, known afar, son of Berezvaṇṭ.

[^965]: One of the immortals, rulers in Hvaniratha: he is said to belong to the Fryāna family (Dādistān XC, 3); he resides in the district of the river Nāīvtāk (Bund. XXIX, 5).

[^966]: See Yt. V, 81.

[^967]: Paitisrīra is perhaps an epithet (most beautiful?), added to distinguish Paēshatah from the hero mentioned in § 115.

[^968]: An allusion to some legend of domestic feud of which Paēshatah was the hero.

[^969]: The high-priest of the Fradadhafshu Karshvare (Spītoīḍ-i Aūspōsīnān; Bund. XXIX, 1; tr. West, note 6).

[^970]: The high-priest of the Vīdadhafshu Karshvare (Aīrīž-rāsp Aūspōsīnān; see ibid., note 7).

[^971]: Cf. §128.

[^972]: Probably the same with Huvāsp, the high-priest in the Vourubareśti Karshvare (Bund. XXIX, 1; tr. West, note 8).

[^973]: Possibly the same with the high-priest in the Vouru-jareśti karshvare, Cakhravāk (ibid., note 9). Cakhravāk is the generic name of the bird Karshipta (Pahl. Comm. ad II, 42 \[139\]); it must stand here by mistake for Cahārāsp.

[^974]: Or, 'the Turanian;' cf. § 113.

[^975]: The text has 'the Fravashi;' cf. §§ 113, 127.

[^976]: See Études Iraniennes, II, 142.

[^977]: The text has 'the Fravashi;' cf. § 113.

[^978]: Different from Jāmāspa, the son of Hvōva (§ 103).

[^979]: Different from Maidhyō-māungha, the son of Arāsti (§ 95).

'If a man holds a bone of that strong bird, or a feather of that strong bird, no one can smite or turn to flight that fortunate man. The feather of that bird of birds brings him help; it brings unto him the homage of men, it maintains in him his glory. {#XIV:36}

'Then the sovereign, the lord of countries, will no longer kill his [^1066] hundreds, though he is a killer of men; the . . . . [^1067] will not kill at one stroke; he alone smites and goes forwards. {#XIV:37}

'All tremble before him who holds the feather, they tremble therefore before me; all my enemies tremble before me and fear my strength and victorious force and the fierceness established in my body. {#XIV:38}

'He [^1068] carries the chariot of the lords; he carries the chariots of the lordly ones, the chariots of the sovereigns. He carried the chariot of Kavi [pg 242] Usa [^1069]; upon his wings runs the male horse [^1070], runs the burden-bearing camel, runs the water of the river. {#XIV:39}

'Where is it that we must invoke the name of Verethraghna, made by Ahura? Where is it that [pg 243] we must praise him? That we must humbly praise him?'

Ahura Mazda answered: 'When armies meet together in full array, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! (asking) which of the two is the party that conquers and is not crushed, that smites and is not smitten; {#XIV:43}

'Do thou throw [^1073] four feathers [^1074] in the way. Whichever of the two will first worship the well-shapen Strength, and Verethraghna, beautiful of form, made by Mazda, on his side will victory stand. {#XIV:44}

'O Zarathuśtra! let not that spell be shown to any one, except by the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother from the same womb, or by the Āthravan to his pupil [^1077]. These are words that are awful and powerful, awful and assembly-ruling, awful and victorious, awful and healing; these are words that save the head that was lost and chant away the uplifted weapon.' {#XIV:46}

#### XVII.

We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura: who goes along the armies arrayed, and goes here [pg 244] and there asking, along with Mithra and Rashnu: 'Who is it who lies unto Mithra? Who is it who thrusts \[his oath\] against Rashnu [^1078]? To whom shall I, in my might, impart illness and death [^1079]? {#XIV:47}

 [^1080]. Ahura Mazda said: 'If men sacrifice unto Verethraghna, made by Ahura, if the due sacrifice and prayer is offered unto him just as it ought to be performed in the perfection of holiness, never will a hostile horde enter the Aryan countries, nor any plague, nor leprosy, nor venomous plants, nor the chariot of a foe, nor the uplifted spear of a foe.' {#XIV:48}

 [^1081]. Zarathuśtra asked: 'What is then, O Ahura Mazda! the sacrifice and invocation in honour of Verethraghna, made by Ahura, as it ought to be performed in the perfection of holiness?' {#XIV:49}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Let the Aryan nations bring libations unto him; let the Aryan nations tie bundles of baresma for him; let the Aryan nations cook for him a head of cattle, either white, or black, or of any other colour, but all of one and the same colour. {#XIV:50}

'Let not a murderer take of those offerings, nor a whore, nor a . . . ., who does not sing the Gāthās, who spreads death in the world and withstands the law of Mazda, the law of Zarathuśtra. {#XIV:51}

'If a murderer take of those offerings, or a whore, or a . . . ., who does not sing the Gāthās, then Verethraghna, made by Ahura, takes back his healing virtues. {#XIV:52}

[pg 245]

'Plagues will ever pour upon the Aryan nations; hostile hordes will ever fall upon the Aryan nations; the Aryans will be smitten by their fifties and their hundreds, by their hundreds and their thousands, by their thousands and their tens of thousands, by their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.' {#XIV:53}

There Verethraghna, made by Ahura, proclaimed thus: 'The Soul of the Bull [^1082], the wise creature, does not receive from man due sacrifice and prayer; for now the Daēvas and the worshippers of the Daēvas make blood flow and spill it like water; {#XIV:54}

[^1104]: Cf. Yt. V, 21, [p. 58](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#page_58), note [2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#fn_295).

[^1105]: Cf. Yt. V, 21-23.

[^1106]: Introduced from § 4 into this and all similar clauses, except the one relating to Aži Dahāka (§ 21).

[^1107]: Takhma Urupa (in later legend Tahmūrāf) was a brother to Yima. He reigned for thirty years and rode Ahriman, turned into a horse. But at last his wife, deceived by Ahriman, revealed to him the secret of her husband's power, and Tahmūrāf was swallowed up by his horse. But Yima managed to take back his brother's body from the body of Ahriman and recovered thereby the arts and civilisation which had disappeared along with Tahmūrāf (see Minokhired XXVII, 32; Ravāet apud Spiegel, Einleitung in die traditionelle Literatur, pp. 317 seq.; Ormazd et Ahriman, § 137 seq.; cf. above, [p. 60](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#page_60), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#fn_302)).

[^1108]: Azinavaṇṭ or zaēnahvaṇṭ: he kept that epithet in later tradition: Zīnavend, 'quod cognomen virum significat armis probe instructum' (Hamza Ispahensis, p. 20, tr. Gottwaldt).

[^1109]: As told Yt. XIX, 29.

[^1110]: Cf. Yasna IX, 4-5 (11-20) and Yt. XIX, 31 seq.

[^1111]: This passage is interpolated from Yasna IX, 5 (17-10.

[^1112]: Or, 'his accursed palace of the Stork' (upa kviriṇtem duzitem). 'Aži Dahāka,' says Hamza (p. 32 in the text, p. 22 in the translation), 'used to live in Babylon (cf. Yt. V, 29), where he had built a palace in the form of a stork; he called it Kuleng Dīs ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/25300.jpg)), the fortress of the Stork; the inhabitants called it Dis Het ( ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/25301.jpg)).' Kuleng Dīs was in Zend Kviriṇta daēza and Dis Het is nothing else than Dužita. One may doubt [pg 254] whether Kviriṇta is the name of a place or the Zend form of Kuleng, a stork: in any case it was a palace in Bawri (Babylon). In the Shah Nāmah it is called Dižukht (duž-ukhta for duž-ita; see Études Iraniennes, II, 211).

[^1113]: Cf. Yt. V, 30 seq.

[^1114]: Yt. V, 34; IX, 14; XVII, 34.

[^1115]: Cf. Yt. V, 37 seq.

[^1116]: An unknown affluent of the Rangha (Tigris).

[^1117]: Sāma had two sons, Keresāspa, a warrior, and Urvākhshaya, a judge and law-giver (Yasna IX, 10 \[29 seq.\]). We have no further details about Urvākhshaya's legend than that he was killed by 'Hitāspa, the golden-crowned' (cf. Yt. XIX, 4I), and avenged by Keresāspa.

[^1118]: A disconnected allusion to the struggle of Keresāspa with the Gaṇdarewa (Yt. V, 38, text and notes; XIX, 41). On the words 'the son of Ahura . . . .' cf. Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 215, note 1.

[^1119]: No other mention is made of Aurvasāra in the Avesta, unless he is alluded to in Yt. V, 50. He does not appear to have been. known to Firdausi.

[^1120]: Spaētiniś razūra is called 'the chief of forests' (Bund. XXIV, 16). According to the Bahman Yaśt (III, 9), it was the seat of the last and decisive battle between Arjāsp and Gūśtāsp.

[^1121]: Cf. Yt. V, 49; IX, 21.

[^1122]: Cf. Yt. V, 50.

[^1123]: This line looks as if it should belong to a counter-prayer by Husravah, which was heard by Vayu, as appears from Yt. V, 50.

[^1124]: See Yt. IX, 26.

[^1125]: See [p. 77](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#page_77), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2310.htm#fn_381).

[^1126]: It may be doubted whether the allusion here is to a legend of marriage en masse, following the marriage of Hutaosa with Vīśtāspa, or whether the aorist is used with an indicative meaning: 'To him do the maids who have known no man . . . . They beg of him a boon, saying . . . .' Cf. Yt. XVI, 17.

[^1127]: Cf. § 5, note 5.

[^1128]: An attempt to an etymological explanation of the name Vayu. Cf. § 53.

[^1134]: Geredha is the burrow of an Ahrimanian creature (see Vend. III, to \[33\]; VII, 24 \[60: Vayu, in that half of him that belongs to the Evil Spirit, is the seat (the burrow) of Ahriman; but with his better half, he struggles against the fiend and destroys him.

Then Mithra seized that Glory, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, whose ear is quick to hear, who has a thousand senses. We sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of all countries, whom Ahura Mazda has created the most glorious of all the gods in the heavens.

The second time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima, the Glory went from Yima, the son of Vīvanghaṇṭ, in the shape of a Vāraghna bird. {#XIX:36}

Then Thraētaona seized that Glory, he, the heir of the valiant Āthwya clan, who was the most victorious of all victorious men next to Zarathuśtra;

Who smote Aži Dahāka, the three-mouthed, the three-headed, the six-eyed, who had a thousand senses, that most powerful, fiendish Druj; that demon baleful to the world, the strongest Druj that Angra Mainyu created against the material world, to destroy the world of the good principle [^1248]. {#XIX:37}

[pg 295]

The third time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima, that Glory went from Yima, the son of Vīvanghaṇṭ, in the shape of a Vāraghna bird. Then the manly-hearted Keresāspa [^1249] seized that Glory; he who was the sturdiest of the men of strength, next to Zarathuśtra, for his manly courage. {#XIX:38}

For Manly Courage clave unto him. We worship Manly Courage, firm or foot, unsleeping, quick to rise, and fully awake, that clave unto Keresāspa; {#XIX:39}

Who killed the snake Srvara, the horse-devouring, men-devouring, yellow, poisonous snake, over which yellow poison flowed a thumb's breadth thick. Upon him Keresāspa was cooking his food in a brass vessel: at the time of noon, the fiend felt the heat, and stood upon his feet: he rushed from under the brass vessel and upset the boiling water: the manly-hearted Keresāspa fell back affrighted [^1250]; {#XIX:40}

Who killed the golden-heeled Gaṇdarewa, that was rushing with open jaws, eager to destroy the living world of the good principle [^1251]; {#XIX:41}

Who killed the brood of Pathana, all the nine [^1252]; [pg 296] and the brood of Nivika, and the brood of Dāśtayana;

Who killed the golden-crowned Hitāspa [^1253], and Vareshava, the son of Dāna [^1254], and Pitaona, attended by many Pairikas [^1255];

Who killed Arezō-shamana, him of the manly courage, who was strong, well-beloved [^1256], hail, energetically rushing, fully awake, never falling back. . . . [^1257]; {#XIX:42}

Who killed Snāvidhaka, him who killed with his nails, the stone-handed: thus did he exclaim to all around: 'I am an infant still, I am not yet of age: if I ever grow of age, I shall make the earth a wheel, I shall make the heavens a chariot; {#XIX:43}

'I shall bring down the Good Spirit from the shining Garō-nmāna; I shall make the Evil Spirit rush up from the dreary Hell. They will carry my [pg 297] chariot, both the Good Spirit and the Evil One, unless the manly-hearted Keresāspa kill me.' {#XIX:44}

The manly-hearted Keresāspa killed him, his life went away, his spirit vanished [^1258].

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

#### VIII.

_We sacrifice unto the awful Glory, that cannot be forcibly seized [^1259], made by Mazda . . . ._ {#XIX:45}

For which the Good Spirit and the Evil One did struggle with one another [^1260]: for that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized [^1259] they flung each of them. their darts most swift. {#XIX:46}

The Good Spirit flung a dart, and so did Vohu-Manō, and Asha-Vahiśta and Ātar, the son of Ahura Mazda.

The Evil Spirit flung a dart, and so did Akem-Manō [^1261], and Aēshma of the wounding spear, and Aži Dahāka and Spityura, he who sawed Yima in twain [^1262].

[pg 298]

Then forward came Ātar [^1263], the son of Ahura Mazda, thinking thus in his heart: 'I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized.' {#XIX:47}

But Aži Dahāka, the three-mouthed, he of the evil law, rushed on his back, thinking of extinguishing it:

'Here give it up to me [^1264], O Ātar, son of Ahura Mazda: if thou seizest that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, I shall rush upon thee, so that thou mayest never more blaze on the earth made by Ahura and protect the world of the good principle.' {#XIX:48}

And Ātar took back his hands, as the instinct of life prevailed, so much had Aži affrighted him.

Then Aži, the three-mouthed, he of the evil law, rushed forward, thinking thus in his heart: 'I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized.' {#XIX:49}

But Ātar, the son of Ahura Mazda, advanced behind him, speaking in these words:

'There give it up to me [^1264], thou three-mouthed Aži Dahāka. If thou seizest that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, then I will enter thy hinder part, I will blaze up in thy jaws, so that thou mayest never more rush upon the earth made by Mazda and destroy the world of the good principle.' {#XIX:50}

Then Aži took back his hands, as the instinct of life prevailed, so much had Ātar affrighted him.

That Glory swells up and goes to the sea [pg 299] Vouru-Kasha. The swift-horsed Son of the Waters [^1265] seizes it at once: this is the wish of the Son of the Waters, the swift-horsed: 'I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, down to the bottom of the sea Vouru-Kasha, in the bottom of the deep rivers.' {#XIX:51}

We sacrifice unto the Son of the Waters, the swift-horsed, the tall and shining lord, the lord of females; the male god, who helps one at his appeal; who made man, who shaped man [^1266], a god who lives beneath waters, and whose ear is the quickest to hear when he is worshipped. {#XIX:52}

'And whosoever of you, O men,'—thus said Ahura Mazda,—'O holy Zarathuśtra! shall seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, he has the gifts [^1267] of an Āthravan [^1268]; whosoever shall long for the illumination of knowledge, he has the gifts of an Āthravan; whosoever shall long for fulness of knowledge, he has the gifts of an Āthravan; {#XIX:53}

'And Riches will cleave unto him, giving him full welfare, holding a shield before him, powerful, rich of cattle and garments; and Victory will cleave unto him, day after day; and likewise Strength, that smites more than a year. Attended by that Victory, he will conquer the havocking hordes; attended by that Victory, he will conquer all those who hate him.' {#XIX:54}

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

#### IX.

_We sacrifice unto the awful Glory, that cannot be forcibly seized, made by Mazda . . . ._ {#XIX:55}

Which the Turanian ruffian Frangrasyan tried to seize in the sea Vouru-Kasha. He stripped himself naked, wishing to seize that Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra [^1269]. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm of the sea Vouru-Kasha was produced, namely, that lake that is called Lake Husravah [^1270]. {#XIX:56}

 [^1271]. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! thinking evil thoughts: '. . . . [^1272] I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra. {#XIX:57}

'Then I will defile all corn and liquors [^1273], as to greatness, goodness, and fairness.' {#XIX:58}

—'Ahura Mazda will come against thee, ever eager to create new creatures [^1274].'

Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed down into the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathuśtra!

[pg 301]

A second time he stripped himself naked, wishing to seize that Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm of the sea Vouru-Kasha was produced, namely, that lake that is called Lake Vanghazdāu [^1275]. {#XIX:59}

 [^1276]. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! thinking evil thoughts: '. . . . [^1277] I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra. {#XIX:60}

'Then I will defile all corn and liquors, as to greatness, goodness, and fairness.' {#XIX:61}

—'Ahura Mazda will come against thee, ever eager to create new creatures.'

Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed down into the sea Vouru-Kasha.

A third time he stripped himself naked, wishing to seize the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm was produced in the sea Vouru-Kasha, namely, the water that is called Awž-dānva. {#XIX:62}

 [^1278]. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! thinking evil thoughts: '. . . . [^1279] I have [pg 302] not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra!' {#XIX:63}

He was not able to seize the Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathuśtra. {#XIX:64}

That cleaves unto him [^1280] who grows up there, where lies Lake Kãsava [^1281], along with the Haētumaṇṭ [^1282] river; there where stands Mount Ushidhāu [^1283], surrounded by waters, that run from the mountain. {#XIX:66}

It [^1284] runs unto him, it flows and swells unto him, bringing good pastures and fine horses, bringing plenty, full of glory; with beauty and weal; powerful and friendly, rich of pastures, prolific and golden. It runs unto him, it flows and swells unto him, bright and glorious, making the white . . . . [^1285] grow, smiting away all plagues. {#XIX:67}

And there comes with him a horse's strength, there comes with him a camel's strength, there [pg 303] comes with him a man's strength, there comes with him the kingly Glory: and there is in him, O holy Zarathuśtra! so much of kingly Glory as might extinguish at once all the non-Aryan nations. {#XIX:68}

And then (through it) living creatures may keep away [^1286] hunger and death, living creatures (may keep away) cold and heat [^1286]. Such is the kingly Glory, the keeper of the Aryan nations and of the five kinds of animals [^1287], made to help the faithful and the Law of the worshippers of Mazda. {#XIX:69}

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

That clave unto Kavi Kavāta, and unto Kavi Aipivōhu, and unto Kavi Usadha, and unto Kavi Arshan, and unto Kavi Pisina, and unto Kavi Byārshan, and unto Kavi Syāvarshan [^1288]; {#XIX:71}

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

#### XII.

_We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . ._ {#XIX:73}

 [^1289]. That clave unto Kavi Husravah for the well-shapen Strength, for the Victory made by Ahura, for the crushing Ascendant; for the righteousness of the law, for the innocence of the law, for the [pg 304] unconquerable power of the law; for the extermination of the enemies at one stroke; {#XIX:74}

And for the vigour of health, for the Glory made by Mazda, for the health of the body, and for a good, virtuous offspring, wise, chief in assemblies, bright, and clear-eyed, that frees \[their father\] from the pangs \[of hell\], of good intellect; and for that part in the blessed world that falls to wisdom and to those who do not follow impiety; {#XIX:75}

And for a dominion full of splendour, for a long, long life, and for all boons and remedies; {#XIX:76}

So that king Husravah \[had the lead\] all along the long race, and he could not pass through the forest, he [^1290], the murderer, who was fiercely striving against him on horseback; the lord Kavi Husravah prevailed over all; he put in bonds Frangrasyan and Keresavazda [^1291], to avenge the murder of his father Syāvarshāna, a man, and of Aghraēratha, a semi-man [^1292]. {#XIX:77}

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

#### XIII.

_We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . ._ {#XIX:78}

That clave unto the holy Zarathuśtra, so that he thought according to the Law, spake according [pg 305] to the Law, and did according to the Law; so that he was the holiest in holiness in all the living world, the best-ruling in exercising rule, the brightest in brightness, the most glorious in glory, the most victorious in victory. {#XIX:79}

At his sight the Daēvas rushed away; at his sight the (demoniac) malices were extinguished; at his sight the Jainis [^1293] drew back their ways from the mortals and, lamenting [^1294] and wailing, laid violent hands on the Daēvas. {#XIX:80}

And that one prayer, the Ahuna Vairya, which the holy Zarathuśtra sang and repeated four times, with a song that waxed louder and louder, drove back all the Daēvas beneath the earth, and took off from them sacrifice and prayer [^1295]. {#XIX:81}

It was it, the Glory of Zarathuśtra, that the Turanian ruffian Frangrasyan tried to seize to rule over all the Karshvares; round about the seven Karshvares did that ruffian Frangrasyan rush, trying to seize the Glory of Zarathuśtra [^1296]. But that Glory escaped to hidden inlets of the sea [^1297]; and there those two [^1298] made my will [^1299] roll on [^1300]; they entered my will, as it was my wish, Ahura Mazda's, and as it was the wish of the Law of Mazda. {#XIX:82}

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

#### XIV.

_We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda . . . ._ {#XIX:83}

That clave unto king Vīśtāspa, so that he thought according to the Law, spake according to the Law, and did according to the Law; so that he professed that Law, destroying his foes and causing the Daēvas to retire. {#XIX:84}

 [^1301]. Who, driving the Druj before him [^1302], sought wide room for the holy religion; who, driving the Druj before him, made wide room for the holy religion; who made himself the arm and support of this law of Ahura, of this law of Zarathuśtra; {#XIX:85}

Who took her, standing bound, from the hands of the Hunus, and established her to sit in the middle \[of the world\], high ruling, never falling back, holy, nourished with plenty of cattle and pastures, blessed with plenty of cattle and pastures. {#XIX:86}

The valiant king Vīśtāspa conquered all enemies, Tãthravaṇṭ of the evil law, Peshana, the worshipper of the Daēvas, and the fiendish wicked Arejaṭ-aspa and the other wicked Hvyaonas [^1303]. {#XIX:87}

When the creation will grow deathless,—the prosperous creation of the Good Spirit,—and the Druj shall perish, though she may rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord. {#XIX:90}

_For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . ._

It was that Glory that Thraētaona bore with him when Aži Dahāka was killed [^1309];

That Frangrasyan, the Turanian, bore when Drvāu [^1310] was killed, when the Bull was killed [^1311]; {#XIX:93}

That king Husravah bore when Frangrasyan, the Turanian, was killed [^1312]; [pg 308] That king Vīśtāspa bore, when he victoriously maintained Holiness against the host of the fiends and took off the Drub from the world of the good principle [^1313].

He [^1314], with the eye of intelligence [^1315], shall look down upon all the creatures of the Paēśiś [^1316], her of the evil seed: he shall look upon the whole living world with the eye of plenty, and his look shall deliver to immortality the whole of the living creatures. {#XIX:94}

And there shall his friends [^1317] come forward, the friends of Astvaṭ-ereta, who are fiend-smiting, well-thinking, well-speaking, well-doing, following the good law, and whose tongues have never uttered a word of falsehood. {#XIX:95}

Before them shall Aēshma of the wounding spear, who has no Glory, bow and flee; he shall smite the most wicked Druj, her of the evil seed, born of darkness.

Akem-Manō [^1318] smites, but Vohu-Manō shall smite him; the Word of falsehood smites, but the Word of truth shall smite it. Haurvatāṭ and Ameretāṭ [^1319] shall smite both hunger and thirst: Haurvatāṭ and Ameretāṭ shall smite the evil hunger and the evil thirst. The evil-doing Angra Mainyu bows and flees, becoming powerless. {#XIX:96}

For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice . . . .

Yathā ahū vairyō: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . . {#XIX:97}

[pg 309]

I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour of Mount Ushi-darena, made by Mazda, the seat of holy happiness; of the kingly Glory, made by Mazda; of the Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, made by Mazda [^1320].

[^1245]: Aži Dahāka and his followers.

[^1246]: The Glory is described as departing three times, because it is threefold, according as it belongs to the king considered as a priest, a warrior, or a husbandman. In that threefold character it is identical with Ādar Frobā, Ādar Gushasp, and Ādar Būrzīn Mihr ([p. 7](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_7), notes).

[^1251]: See Yt. V, 38.

[^1252]: Known in the Minokhired (XXVII, 50) as 'the wolf Kapōḍ' (perhaps 'the blue wolf,' as Mr. West suggests), 'which they also call Pehan.' Those nine sons of Pathana were nine highwaymen (the very word Pathana seems to have that meaning): their defeat is told by Keresāspa in a Pahlavi Rivāyat as follows: 'I have slain the highwaymen who were so big in body that, when they were [pg 296] walking, people considered in this way, that "below them are the stars and moon, and below them moves the sun at dawn, and the water of the sea reaches up to their knees." And I reached up to their legs, and they were smitten on the legs by me; they fell, and the hills on the earth were shattered by them' (West, Pahlavi Texts, II, 376). Keresāspa's Fravashi, accordingly, is invoked against thieves (Yt. XIII, 136). Perhaps the assimilation of the wolf Kapōḍ with Pehan is merely a guess of the author of the Minokhired.

[^1253]: The murderer of Keresāspa's brother, Urvākhshaya (Yt. XV, 28).

[^1254]: Doubtful: dānayana. Vāresha is the Pahlavi name of a bird of prey (Bund. XIV, 30), which might induce us to identify Vareshava with the gigantic bird Kamak, 'which overshadowed the earth and kept off the rain till the rivers dried up' (West, l.l. 378), and whose destruction was one of the feats of Keresāspa.

[^1255]: Like the Pairika Knãthaiti, who clave to Keresāspa (Vend. I, 10 \[36\]).

[^1256]: Doubtful: frāzuśtem.

[^1257]: The rest of the sentence is obscure, and the text seems to be corrupt.

[^1258]: Snāvidhaka reminds one vividly of the Titanic Otus and Ephialtes (Odyssea XI, 308):

    'Such were they youths! Had they to manhood grown,
     Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne:
     But ere the harvest of the beard began
     To bristle on the chin, and promise man,
     His shafts Apollo aim’d.' (Pope.)

[^1259]: The sacerdotal Glory; see [p. 11](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_11), note [6](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#fn_78), cf. § 53.

[^1260]: When it had departed from Yima.

[^1261]: Bad Thought, the demoniac counterpart of Vohu-Manō (Vend. Introd. IV, 34).

[^1262]: Spityura was a brother of Yima's (Bund. XXXI, 3: 'Spītūr was he who, with Dahāk, cut up Yim,' ibid. 5, tr. West). Nothing more is known of him, though he appears to have played a great part in the original Yima legend, and to have stood to his brother in the same relation as Barmāyūn and Katāyūn to Ferīdūn, or [pg 298] Shagād to Rustam. Firdausi does not mention him, and makes Dahāk himself saw Jemshīd.

[^1263]: Ādar Frobā (the Glory of the Priest) is meant here: 'when they sawed Yim, Ādar Frobā saved his Glory from the hand of Dahāk' (Bund. XVII, 5; Études Iraniennes, II, 70, 84).

[^1264]: Doubtful.

[^1265]: Apãm Napāṭ; see [p. 6](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#page_6), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2304.htm#fn_28).

[^1266]: An allusion to old myths on the igneous origin of life (Ormazd et Ahriman, § 78).

[^1267]: Doubtful.

[^1268]: As that Glory is the one that belongs to the Āthravan.

[^1269]: See Études Iraniennes, II, 227; cf. § 82.

[^1270]: Lake Husru is within fifty leagues (parasang) of Lake Cēcast' (Lake Urumiah, Bund. XXII, 8, tr. West).

[^1271]: Cf. §§ 60, 63.

[^1272]: Itha itha yathana ahmāi.

[^1273]: Tarshuca khshudraca, translated dhānyāni madhūnica (Sansk. tr. to Āfrīgān Gāhambār, § 12). Afrāsyāb was charged with having laid Iran waste by filling up or conducting away rivers (Hamzah Ispahensis, p. 34; cf. Bund. XXI, 6).

[^1274]: This looks like an answer to Afrāsyāb's threats.

[^1275]: The situation of that lake is not stated.

[^1276]: Cf. § 57, 63.

[^1277]: Itha itha yathana ahmāi avatha itha yathana ahmāi.

[^1278]: Cf. §§ 57, 60.

[^1279]: Itha itha yathana ahmāi avatha itha yathana ahmāi āvoya itha yathana ahmāi.

[^1280]: That is to say, to any one who . . . . The Kavis or Kings of Iran are meant: Lake Kãsava was supposed to be 'the home of the Kayān race' (Bund. XXI, 7). The Kavis are enumerated in the following clauses (§§ 71 seq.).

[^1281]: The present Zarah or Hamūn sea in Seistan.

[^1282]: The Helmend (Ἐτύμανδρος; cf. Vend. I, 14).

[^1283]: The seat of the Hvarenō; see [p. 33](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2306.htm#page_33), note [1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2306.htm#fn_172), , note [^1210], and Introduction to Yt. XVIII.

[^1284]: The water of the rivers in which the Glory lies, and in the midst of which the Kavi has been nourished.

[^1285]: ? Varemiś.

[^1286]: Doubtful.

[^1287]: See [p. 182](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2318.htm#page_182), note [2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2318.htm#fn_817).

[^1288]: See Yt. XIII, § 132.

[^1289]: §§ 74-76 = Yt. XIII, 133-135.

[^1290]: Aurvasāra; see Yt. XV, 32; cf. Yt. V, 50 (where the words all along the long race have been omitted in the translation). The words have the lead here have been supplied from Yt. V, 50: the text here has two words, tãm keresem, of which both the reading and the meaning are doubtful.

[^1291]: Keresavazda, the Karsīvaz of Firdausi, the brother of Afrāsyāb and the murderer of Syāvarshāna: he was put to death by Husravah in company with his brother (Études Iraniennes, II, 227).

[^1297]: Cf. §§ 56, 59, 62.

### XXI AND XXII. YAŚT FRAGMENTS.

_These two Yaśts or Yaśt fragments are known among the Parsis as the Hādhōkht Nask, though their context does not correspond to any part of the description of that Nask as given in the Dīn-kart (West, Pahlavi Texts, I, 224, note 8). A Pahlavi translation of these Yaśts has been edited by Haug and West (The Book of Ardā Vīrāf, p. 269 seq.)._

## XXI. YAŚT FRAGMENT.


Zarathuśtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! {#XXI:1}

What is the only word in which is contained the glorification of all good things, of all the things that are the offspring of the good principle?'

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the praise of Holiness [^1325], O Spitama Zarathuśtra! {#XXI:2}

'He who recites the praise of Holiness [^1325], in the fulness of faith and with a devoted heart, praises me, Ahura Mazda; he praises the waters, he praises the earth, he praises the cattle, he praises the plants, he praises all good things made by Mazda, all the things that are the offspring of the good principle. {#XXI:3}

'For the reciting of that word of truth, O Zarathuśtra! the pronouncing of that formula, the Ahuna Vairya, increases strength and victory in one's soul and piety. {#XXI:4}

[pg 312]

'For that only recital of the praise of Holiness is worth a hundred khshnaothras of the beings of Holiness [^1326], when delivered while going to sleep, a thousand when delivered after eating, ten thousand when delivered during cohabitation, or any number when delivered in departing this life.' {#XXI:5}

'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth ten others in greatness, goodness, and fairness? {#XXI:6}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathuśtra! that a man delivers when eating the gifts of Haurvatāṭ and Ameretāṭ [^1327], at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.' {#XXI:7}

'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth a hundred others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?' {#XXI:8}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathuśtra! that a man delivers while drinking of the Haoma strained for the sacrifice, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.' {#XXI:9}

'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth a thousand others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?' {#XXI:10}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathuśtra! that a man delivers when starting [pg 313] up from his bed or going to sleep again, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.' {#XXI:11}

'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth ten thousand others in greatness, goodness, and fairness?' {#XXI:12}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathuśtra! that a man delivers when waking up and rising from sleep, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.' {#XXI:13}

'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth this Karshvare of ours, Hvaniratha [^1328], with its cattle and its chariots, without its men, in greatness, goodness, and fairness?' {#XXI:14}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathuśtra! that a man delivers in the last moments of his life, at the same time professing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and rejecting evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.' {#XXI:15}

'What is the one recital of the praise of Holiness that is worth all that is between the earth and the heavens, and this earth, and that luminous space, and all the good things made by Mazda, that are the offspring of the good principle in greatness, goodness, and fairness?' {#XXI:16}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is that one, O holy Zarathuśtra! that a man delivers to renounce evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds [^1329].' {#XXI:17}

[^1325]: Asha: the Ashem Vohū.

[^1326]: A hundred times the formula: 'Be propitiation (khshnaothra) unto N. . . ., the holy and master of holiness' (cf. [p. 1](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2303.htm#page_1), note [2](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2303.htm#fn_3)).

## XXII. YAŚT XXII.


#### I.

Zarathuśtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! {#XXII:1}

'When one of the faithful departs this life, where does his soul abide on that night?'

Ahura Mazda answered:

'It takes its seat near the head, singing the Uśtavaiti Gātha [^1331] and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes!" On that night his soul tastes [^1332] as much of pleasure as the whole of the living world can taste.' [pg 315] 3\. —'On the second night where does his soul abide? {#XXII:2}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It takes its seat near the head, singing the Uśtavaiti Gātha and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes!" On that night his soul tastes as much of pleasure as the whole of the living world can taste.' {#XXII:4}

—'On the third night where does his soul abide? {#XXII:5}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It takes its seat near the head, singing the Uśtavaiti Gātha and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes!" On that night his soul tastes as much of pleasure as the whole of the living world can taste.' {#XXII:6}

At the end [^1333] of the third night, when the dawn appears, it seems to the soul of the faithful one as if it were brought amidst plants and scents: it seems as if a wind were blowing from the region of the south, from the regions of the south, a sweet-scented wind, sweeter-scented than any other wind in the world. {#XXII:7}

And it seems to the soul of the faithful one as if he were inhaling that wind with the nostrils, and he thinks: 'Whence does that wind blow, the sweetest-scented wind I ever inhaled with my nostrils? {#XXII:8}

And it seems to him as if his own conscience were advancing to him in that wind, in the shape of a maiden fair, bright, white-armed, strong, tall-formed, [pg 316] high-standing, thick-breasted, beautiful of body, noble, of a glorious seed [^1334], of the size of a maid in her fifteenth year, as fair as the fairest things in the world. {#XXII:9}

And the soul of the faithful one addressed her, asking: 'What maid art thou, who art the fairest maid I have ever seen?' {#XXII:10}

And she, being his own conscience, answers him: 'O thou youth of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion, I am thy own conscience! {#XXII:11}

'Everybody did love thee for that greatness, goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength and freedom from sorrow, in which thou dost appear to me;

'And so thou, O youth of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion! didst love me for that greatness, goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength, and freedom from sorrow, in which I appear to thee. {#XXII:12}

'When thou wouldst see a man making derision [^1335] and deeds of idolatry, or rejecting [^1336] (the poor) and shutting his door [^1337], then thou wouldst sit singing the Gāthas and worshipping the good waters and Ātar, the son of Ahura Mazda, and rejoicing [^1338] the faithful that would come from near or from afar. {#XXII:13}

[pg 317]

'I was lovely and thou madest me still lovelier; I was fair and thou madest me still fairer; I was desirable and thou madest me still more desirable; I was sitting in a forward place and thou madest me sit in the foremost place, through this good thought, through this good speech, through this good deed of thine; and so henceforth men worship me for my having long sacrificed unto and conversed with Ahura Mazda. {#XXII:14}

'The first step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Thought [^1339] Paradise; {#XXII:15}

'The second step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Word [^1340] Paradise;

'The third step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Deed [^1341] Paradise;

'The fourth step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Endless Lights [^1342].'

Then one of the faithful, who had departed before him, asked him, saying: 'How didst thou depart this life, thou holy man? How didst thou come, thou holy man! from the abodes full of cattle and full of the wishes and enjoyments of love? From the material world into the world of the spirit? From the decaying world into the undecaying one? How long did thy felicity last?' {#XXII:16}

And Ahura Mazda answered: 'Ask him not what thou askest him, who has just gone the dreary [pg 318] way, full of fear and distress, where the body and the soul part from one another. {#XXII:17}

'\[Let him eat\] of the food brought to him, of the oil of Zaremaya [^1343]: this is the food for the youth of good thoughts, of good words, of good deeds, of good religion, after he has departed this life; this is the food for the holy woman, rich in good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, well-principled and obedient to her husband, after she has departed this life.' {#XXII:18}

#### II.

Zarathuśtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! {#XXII:19}

'When one of the wicked perishes, where does his soul abide on that night?'

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It rushes and sits near the skull, singing the Kima [^1344] Gātha, O holy Zarathuśtra! {#XXII:20}

' "To what land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying?"

'On that night his soul tastes as much of suffering as the whole of the living world can taste.'

—'On the second night, where does his soul abide?' {#XXII:21}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It rushes and sits near the skull, singing the Kima Gātha, O holy [pg 319] Zarathuśtra! "To what land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying?" {#XXII:22}

'On that night his soul tastes as much of suffering as the whole of the living world can taste.'

—'On the third night, where does his soul abide?' {#XXII:23}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It rushes and sits near the skull, singing the Kima Gātha, O holy Zarathuśtra! "To what land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying?" {#XXII:24}

'On that night his soul tastes as much of suffering as the whole of the living world can taste.'

At the end of the third night, O holy Zarathuśtra! when the dawn appears, it seems to the soul of the faithless one as if it were brought amidst snow and stench, and as if a wind were blowing from the region of the north, from the regions of the north, a foul-scented wind, the foulest-scented of all the winds in the world. {#XXII:25}

-32. And it seems to the soul of the wicked man as if he were inhaling that wind with the nostrils, and he thinks: 'Whence does that wind blow, the foulest-scented wind that I ever inhaled with my nostrils [^1345]?' [pg 320] 33\. The first step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Evil-Thought Hell; {#XXII:26}

The second step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Evil-Word Hell;

The third step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Evil-Deed Hell;

The fourth step that the soul of the wicked man made laid him in the Endless Darkness.

Then one of the wicked who departed before him addressed him, saying: 'How didst thou perish, O wicked man? How didst thou come, O fiend! from the abodes full of cattle and full of the wishes and enjoyments of love? From the material world into the world of the Spirit? From the decaying [pg 321] world into the undecaying one? How long did thy suffering last?' {#XXII:34}

Angra Mainyu, the lying one, said: 'Ask him not what thou askest him, who has just gone the dreary way, full of fear and distress, where the body and the soul part from one another. {#XXII:35}

'Let him eat of the food brought unto him, of poison and poisonous stench [^1346]: this is the food, after he has perished, for the youth of evil thoughts, evil words, evil deeds, evil religion after he has perished; this is the food for the fiendish woman, rich in evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds, evil religion, ill-principled, and disobedient to her husband. {#XXII:36}

 [^1347]. 'We worship the Fravashi of the holy man, whose name is Asmō-hvanvaṇṭ [^1348]; then I will worship the Fravashis of the other holy Ones who were strong of faith [^1349]. {#XXII:37}

 [^1347]. 'We worship the memory of Ahura Mazda, to keep the Holy Word. {#XXII:38}

'We worship the understanding of Ahura Mazda, to study the Holy Word.

'We worship the tongue of Ahura Mazda, to speak forth the Holy Word.

'We worship the mountain that gives understanding, that preserves understanding; \[we worship [pg 322] it\] by day and by night, with offerings of libations well-accepted [^1350].

 [^1351]. 'O Maker! how do the souls of the dead, the Fravashis of the holy Ones, manifest [^1352] themselves [^1353]?' {#XXII:39}

Ahura Mazda answered: 'They manifest themselves from goodness of spirit and excellence of mind [^1354].' {#XXII:40}

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 [^1355]. Then towards the dawning of the dawn [^1356], that bird Parōdarś [^1357], that bird Karetō-dãsu [^1358] hears the voice of the Fire. {#XXII:41}

[pg 323]

Here the fiendish Būshyãsta, the long-handed, rushes from the region of the north, from the regions of the north, speaking thus, lying thus: 'Sleep on, O men! Sleep on, O sinners! Sleep on and live in sin.' {#XXII:42}

[^1330]: See , note [^1345].

[^1331]: The name of the second Gātha, which begins with the word uśta: the words in the text, 'Happy the man . . . .,' are its opening line (Yaśna XLII, 1).

[^1332]: Literally, sees, perceives.

[^1333]: Thraośta: in Pahlavi rōiśman.

[^1334]: 'That is to say, from the gods' (Pahl. Comm.).

[^1335]: Of holy things.

[^1336]: Doubtful. The Pahlavi commentary has the following gloss: 'He would not give his friends what they begged for.'

[^1337]: To the poor:—Urvarō-straya: urvar babāic kart (Pahl. Comm.): āighshān babā barā asrūnast (star, to tie, as in frastaretem baresma). Cf. Yt. XXIV, 37, 59.

[^1338]: With alms to the poor Mazdayasnians (ashō-dād).

[^1339]: The so-called Hūmat Paradise (cf. Yt. III, 3).

[^1340]: The so-called Hūkht Paradise.

[^1341]: The so-called Hvarsht Paradise.

[^1342]: The seat of the Garōthmān.

[^1343]: Zaremaya is the spring: the word translated oil (raoghna, Persian ![](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/img/31800.jpg)) might perhaps be better translated 'butter;' the milk made in the middle of spring was said to be the best (Vispērad I, 2; Pahl. Comm.; cf. Dādistān XXXI, 14).

[^1344]: The Gātha of lamenting, beginning with the word Kãm (Kãm nemē zãm: 'To what land shall I turn?'); Yasna XLVI (XLV).

[^1345]: A development similar to that in §§ 9-14 is to be supplied here: in the Ardā Vīrāf and the Minokhired the soul of the wicked is met by a horrid old woman, who is his own conscience: 'And in that wind he saw his own religion and deeds, as a profligate woman, naked, decayed, gaping, bandy-legged, lean-hipped, and unlimitedly spotted, so that spot was joined to spot, like the most hideous noxious creatures (khrafstar), most filthy and most stinking' (cf. § 9).

    Then that wicked soul spoke thus: 'Who art thou? than whom I never saw any one of the creatures of Aūharmazd and Akharman uglier, or filthier or more stinking' (cf. § 10).

    To him she spoke thus: 'I am thy bad actions, O youth of evil thoughts, of evil words, of evil deeds, of evil religion! It [pg 320] is on account of thy will and actions that I am hideous and vile, iniquitous and diseased, rotten and foul-smelling, unfortunate and distressed, as appears to thee (cf. §§ 11-12).

    'When thou sawest any one who performed the Yazishn and Drōn ceremonies, and praise and prayer and the service of God, and preserved and protected water and fire, cattle and trees, and other good creations, thou practisedst the will of Akharman and the demons, and improper actions. And when thou sawest one who provided hospitable reception, and gave something deservedly in gifts and charity, for the advantage of the good and worthy who came from far, and who were from near, thou wast avaricious, and shuttedst up thy door (cf. § 13).

    'And though I have been unholy (that is, I have been considered bad), I am made more unholy through thee; and though I have been frightful, I am made more frightful through thee; though I have been tremulous, I am made more tremulous through thee; though I am settled in the northern region of the demons, I am settled further north through thee; through these evil thoughts, through these evil words, and through these evil deeds, which thou practisedst. They curse me, a long time, in the long execration and evil communion of the Evil Spirit (cf. § 14).

    'Afterwards that soul of the wicked advanced the first footstep on Dūsh-hūmat (the place of evil thoughts), &c.' (The Book of Ardā Vīrāf, XVII, 12-27, as translated by Haug).

[^1346]: Cf. Yasna XXXI, 20: 'He who would deceive the holy One, to him afterwards (will be) a long weeping in the dark place, bad food and words of insult. O wicked! this is the place down which your own conscience will bring you through your own deeds.'

[^1347]: §§ 37-[38](http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/errata.htm#4), 39-40, 41-42 are separate fragments.

[^1348]: One of the first disciples of Zoroaster; cf. Yt. XIII, 96.

[^1350]: § 38 = Yt. I, 31.

[^1351]: A Pahlavi translation of the following two fragments is found in MS. 33, Paris, Supplément Persan (edited in Études Iraniennes, II).

[^1352]: Cithra (Paris MS. p. 255).

[^1353]: 'How do they manifest their assistance?' (Pahl. tr. ibid.); that is to say, when do they assist their relations and countrymen? (see Yt. XIII, 49 seq.)

[^1354]: When men are instinct with good spirit and good thought.

[^1355]: The Pahlavi translation of this fragment has here §§ 14-16 of the Ātash Nyāyiś, then §§ 18-19 of Vendīdād XVIII. Therefore the whole passage is to be restored as follows:

    Ātar looks at the hands of all those who pass by: 'What does the friend bring to his friend . . . .?' (Ātash N. 14.)

    And if that passer-by brings him wood holily brought, or bundles of baresma holily tied up . . . ., then Ātar . . . . will bless him thus:

    May herds of oxen grow for thee . . . . (Ātash N. 15-16).

    In the first part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, calls the master of the house for help, saying:

    'Up! arise, thou master of the house . . . .' (Vend. XVIII, 18-19).

    'Then towards the dawning of the dawn . . . .' (see the text).

[^1356]: Cf. Vend. XVIII, 23.

[^1357]: 'He who has knowledge made,' or 'He who has the knowledge of what is made' (kartak dānishn); his other name Parōdarś is 'He who foresees.'

[^1358]: Here again a large passage is omitted: it can only partly be [pg 323] supplied from the Pahlavi translation; the words in brackets refer to Zend texts lost to us:

    'Then he flaps his wings and lifts up his voice, saying: "Arise, O men! \[and also women, grown-up people, and children, &c . . . . Put on well your girdle and shirt, wash your hands, put your girdle around your body, go and give food to the cattle and recite aloud the five holy Gāthas of Spitama Zarathuśtra."\]

    'Here the fiendish Būshyãsta . . . .' (see the text). Then the Pahlavi translation has: 'Never care for the three excellent things, good thoughts, good words, good deeds' (cf. Vend. XVIII, 25).

[pg 324]

### XXIII-XXIV. ĀFRĪN PAIGHAMBAR ZARTŪŚT AND VĪŚTĀSP YAŚT.

_'God taught the Zendávasta to Zartusht—a sublime work . . . . God said to Zartusht, "Go and before Sháh Gushtásp read this book, that he may come into the faith . . . . keep all my counsel and repeat it word by word to Sháh Gushtásp [^1359]." '_

_Zartusht, in obedience to God, went to the court of Gushtásp: 'He came forward and called down a blessing on the Shāh [^1360].' Then he read to him the Zandávasta and said: 'Learn its statutes and walk therein. If your desire is towards its laws, your abode shall be in the paradise of heaven. But if you turn away from its commandments, you shall bring down your crowned head to the dust. Your God will be displeased with you, and will overthrow your prosperous condition. At the last you shall descend into hell, if you hear not the counsel of the Almighty [^1361].'_

_These lines of the Zartusht-Namah are a summary of the following two Yaśts. The first, entitled 'The blessing of the prophet Zartūśt,' contains the words of blessing addressed by Zarathuśtra when appearing before the king. These words seem to have followed a similar blessing pronounced by Jāmāspa [^1362], the prime minister of Vīśtāspa [^1363]._

_Yaśt XXIV contains the exhortations of the prophet to the king to follow and closely adhere to the Law of Mazda. It is a counterpart to the XIXth Fargard of the Vendīdād, as Zarathuśtra plays here the same part to Vīśtāspa as Ahura does there to Zarathuśtra. It is, therefore, a summary of the Law, of the duties it_ [pg 325] _enforces and of the rewards it promises. This accounts for the strange disconnection apparent in it, which makes it a crux interpretum, as, besides the very corrupt state of the text, the chief difficulty of this Yaśt arises from the fact that many passages in it are incomplete quotations from the Vendīdād, or allusions to statements therein [^1364], which, when supplied, help a good deal to relieve this Yaśt from its apparent state of utter incoherence._

_For this translation I was able to avail myself of a Pahlavi translation, of which a copy was kindly lent to me by Mr. West. That translation is apparently of late date and often manifestly wrong; yet it was very useful to me in several passages, besides its giving a Zend text generally more correct and more correctly divided than the text in Westergaard's edition [^1365]._

_Yaśt XXIII was originally no independent Yaśt, being nothing more than the beginning of Yaśt XXIV, detached from it, with one slight alterations and inversions._

## XXIV. VĪŚTĀSP YAŚT.

#### I.

'I am a pious man, who speaks words of blessing,' thus said Zarathuśtra to the young king Vīśtāspa [^1388].—'She [^1389] appears to me full of Glory, O Zarathuśtra!'—'O young king Vīśtāspa! \[I bless thee [^1390]\] with the living of a good life, of an exalted life, of a long life. May thy men live long! May thy women live long! May sons be born unto thee of thy own body [^1391]! {#XXIV:1}

'Mayest thou thyself [^1392] be holy, like Zarathuśtra! {#XXIV:2}

'Mayest thou be rich in cattle, like an Āthwyanide [^1393]!

'Mayest thou be rich in horses, like Pouruś-aspa [^1394]!

'Mayest thou have a good share of bliss [^1395], like king Husravah!

'Mayest thou have strength to reach the Rangha, whose way lies afar, as Vafra Navāza did [^1396].

[pg 329]

'May ten sons be born of thy own body [^1397]! three as Āthravans [^1398], three as warriors [^1399], three as tillers of the ground [^1400]! May one of them be like Jāmāspa [^1401], that he may bless thee with great and ever greater happiness [^1402]! {#XXIV:3}

'Mayest thou be freed from sickness and death, like Peshō-tanu [^1403]. {#XXIV:4}

'Mayest thou have piercing rays, like Mithra!

'Mayest thou be warm, like the moon!

'Mayest thou be [^1404] resplendent, like fire!

'Mayest thou be long-lived, as long-lived as an old man can be [^1405]!

'And when thou hast fulfilled a duration of a thousand years, \[mayest thou obtain\] the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones! {#XXIV:5}

_'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

[pg 330]

#### II.

 [^1406]. 'Give [^1407] him strength and victory! Give him welfare in cattle and bread [^1408]!' thus said Zarathuśtra to the young king Vīśtāspa! 'Give him a great number [^1409] of male children, praisers [^1410] \[of God\] and chiefs in assemblies, who smite and are not smitten, who smite at one stroke their enemies, who smite at one stroke their foes, ever in joy and ready to help. {#XXIV:6}

'Ye gods of full Glory, ye gods of full healing, let your greatness become manifest!' {#XXIV:7}

Zarathuśtra addressed him, saying: 'O young king Vīśtāspa! May their greatness become manifest as it is called for! {#XXIV:8}

'Ye Waters, impart and give your Glory to the man who offers you a sacrifice!

'This is the boon we beg (for thee) of Ashi Vanguhi [^1411], of Rāta [^1412], with eyes of love.'

Pāreṇdi [^1413], of the light chariot, follows: 'Mayest thou [^1414] become manifest unto him, the young king Vīśtāspa! {#XXIV:9}

'May plenty dwell in this house, standing upon high columns and rich in food [^1415]! Thou wilt never [pg 331] offer and give bad food to a priest: for a priest must be to thee like the brightest [^1416] offspring of thy own blood.'

Zarathuśtra spake unto him: 'O young king Vīśtāspa! {#XXIV:10}

'He who supports the Law of the worshippers of Mazda, as a brother or as a friend, he who treats her friendly in any way, looks to keep off want of food from her [^1417].'

The holy Zarathuśtra preached that law to Frashaośtra [^1418] and Jāmāspa: 'May ye practise holiness and thrive, O young Frashaośtra (and Jāmāspa)!' {#XXIV:11}

Thus said Ahura Mazda unto the holy Zarathuśtra, and thus again did Zarathuśtra say unto the young king Vīśtāspa: 'Have no bad priests or unfriendly priests; for bad priests or unfriendly priests will bring about much harm, and, though thou wish to sacrifice, it will be to the Amesha-Speṇtas as if no sacrifice had been offered [^1419]. {#XXIV:12}

_'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

#### III.

'When I teach thee, that thou mayest do the same to thy son [^1420], O Vīśtāspa! receive thou well that teaching; that will make thee rich in children and rich in milk; rich in seed, in fat, in milk [^1421]. {#XXIV:13}

[pg 332]

'Thus do we announce unto thee, Ahura Mazda, and Sraosha, and Ashi, and the Law of the worshippers of Mazda, with the whole of all her hymns, with the whole of all her deeds, with the whole of her performances; the Law of Mazda, who obtains her wishes, who makes the world grow, who listens to the songs and rejoices the faithful man at his wish; who protects the faithful man, who maintains the faithful man; {#XXIV:14}

'From whom come the knowledge of holiness and the increase in holiness of the world of the holy Principle, and without whom [^1422] no faithful man [^1423] can know holiness. {#XXIV:15}

'To thee [^1424] come every Hāvanan, every Ātare-vakhsha, every Frabaretar, every Ābereṭ, every Āsnātar, every Rathwiśkar, every Sraoshā-varez [^1425];

'Every priest, every warrior, every husbandman; every master of a house, every lord of a borough, every lord of a town, every lord of a province; {#XXIV:16}

'Every youth of good thoughts, good words, good deeds, and good religion; every youth who speaks the right words; every one who performs the next-of-kin marriage [^1426]; every itinerant priest; every mistress of a house; every wandering priest, obedient to the Law. {#XXIV:17}

'To thee come all the performers [^1427] (of holiness), all the masters of holiness, who, to the [pg 333] number of three and thirty [^1428], stand next to Hāvani, being masters of holiness. {#XXIV:18}

'May they be fully protected [^1429] in thee, O young king Vīśtāspa! While thou smitest thy adversaries, thy foes, those who hate thee, a hundred times a hundred for a hundred [^1430], a thousand times a thousand for a thousand, ten thousand times ten thousand for ten thousand, myriads of myriads for a myriad. {#XXIV:19}

'Proclaim thou that word, as we did proclaim it unto thee! {#XXIV:20}

'O Maker of the good world! Ahura Mazda, I worship thee with a sacrifice, I worship and forward thee with a sacrifice, I worship this creation of Ahura Mazda.'

 [^1431]. The young king Vīśtāspa asked Zarathuśtra: 'With what manner of sacrifice shall I worship, with what manner of sacrifice shall I worship and forward this creation of Ahura Mazda?' {#XXIV:21}

Zarathuśtra answered: 'We will make it known unto thee, O young king Vīśtāspa! {#XXIV:22}

'Go towards that tree that is beautiful, high-growing, and mighty amongst the high-growing trees, and say thou these words: "Hail to thee! O good, holy tree, made by Mazda! Ashem Vohū!"

'Let the faithful man cut off twigs of baresma, either one, or two, or three: let him bind them and [pg 334] tie them up according to the rites, being bound and unbound according to the rites. {#XXIV:23}

'The smallest twig of Haoma, pounded according to the rules, the smallest twig prepared for sacrifice, gives royalty to the man (who does it).'

_Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

#### IV.

 [^1432]. Zarathuśtra said: 'O young king Vīśtāspa! {#XXIV:24}

'Invoke Ahura Mazda, who is full of Glory, Ahura Mazda, and the sovereign Heaven, the boundless Time, and Vayu who works highly.

'Invoke the powerful Wind, made by Mazda, and Fate. {#XXIV:25}

'Repeat thou those words, that the god invoked may give thee the boon wished for; that thou, strong, and belonging to the creation of the good Spirit, mayest smite and take away the Druj and watch with full success those who hate thee; smite down thy foes, and destroy at one stroke thy adversaries, thy enemies, and those who hate thee [^1433].

'Proclaim thou those prayers: they will cleanse thy body from deeds of lust [^1434], O young king Vīśtāspa! {#XXIV:26}

'I will worship thee, O Fire, son of Ahura Mazda, who art a valiant warrior. He falls upon the fiend Kuṇda [^1435], who is drunken without drinking, upon the men of the Druj, the slothful ones [^1436], the wicked Daēva-worshippers, who live in sin.

[pg 335]

'He [^1437] trembles at the way [^1438] made by Time and open both to the wicked and to the righteous. {#XXIV:27}

'They [^1439] tremble at the perfume of his soul [^1440], as a sheep does on which a wolf is falling.

'Reciting the whole collection of the Staota Yēsnya [^1441] prayers brings one up all the way to the blessed Garō-nmāna, the palace beautifully made. That indeed is the way. {#XXIV:28}

'That man does not follow the way of the Law, O Zarathuśtra [^1442]! who commits the Baodhō-(varśta) crime [^1443] with a damsel and an old woman [^1444],' said Zarathuśtra to the young king Vīśtāspa. {#XXIV:29}

'Let him [^1445] praise the Law, O Spitama Zarathuśtra! and long for it and embrace the whole of the Law, as an excellent horse turns back from the wrong way and goes along the right one, smiting the many Drujes [^1446].

'Go forward with praises, go forward the way of the good Mazdean law and of all those who walk in her ways, men and women. {#XXIV:30}

[pg 336]

'He who wishes to seize the heavenly reward [^1447], will seize it by giving gifts to him who holds up (the Law) to us [^1448] in this world here below [^1449] . . .

'Let him [^1450] give (the Law) to him who is unfriendly to her, that he may become friendly. {#XXIV:31}

'Wash thy hands with water, not with gōmēz [^1451], and let thy son, who will be born of thy wife [^1452], do the same.

'Thus thy thought will be powerful to smite him [^1453], who is not so [^1454]; thy speech will be powerful to smite him, who is not so; thy deed will be powerful to smite him.

' "Hear me! Forgive me [^1455]!"—We, the Amesha-Speṇtas, will come and show thee, O Zarathuśtra! the way to that world [^1456], to long glory in the spiritual world, to long happiness of the soul in Paradise; {#XXIV:32}

'To bliss and Paradise, to the Garō-nmāna of Ahura Mazda, beautifully made and fully adorned, [pg 337] when his soul goes out of his body through the will of fate, when I, Ahura Mazda, when I, Ahura Mazda, gently show him his way as he asks for it. {#XXIV:33}

_'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

#### V.

'They [^1457] will impart to thee full brightness and Glory. {#XXIV:34}

'They will give him [^1458] quick [^1459] and swift horses, and good sons.

'He wishes to go to the Law, the young king Vīśtāspa.'

Zarathuśtra said: 'Let him who is unfriendly to her become a follower of the Law of Mazda, such as we proclaim it.

'Proclaim thou ever (unto the poor): "Ever mayest thou wait here for the refuse that is brought unto thee, brought by those who have profusion of wealth [^1460]!" Thus the Druj will not fall upon thee and throw thee away; thou wilt wield kingly power there [^1461]. {#XXIV:35}

'The Law of Mazda will not deliver thee unto pain [^1462]. Thou art entreated (for charity) by the whole of the living world, and she [^1463] is ever standing at thy door in the person of thy brethren in the faith: beggars are ever standing at the door of the stranger, amongst those who beg for bread. {#XXIV:36}

[pg 338]

'Ever will that bread be burning coal upon thy head [^1464].

'The good, holy Rāta [^1465], made by Mazda, goes and nurses thy bright offspring [^1466].'

Zarathuśtra addressed Vīśtāspa, saying: 'O young king Vīśtāspa! The Law of Mazda, O my son! will give thy offspring the victorious strength that destroys the fiends. {#XXIV:37}

'Let no thought of Angra Mainyu ever infect thee, so that thou shouldst indulge in evil lusts, make derision and idolatry, and shut (to the poor) the door of thy house [^1467].

 [^1468]. 'Ātar thus blesses the man who brings incense to him, being pleased with him and not angry, and fed as he required: "May herds of oxen grow for thee, and increase of sons! May fate and its decrees bring thee the boons thou wishest for! Therefore do thou invoke and praise (me) excellently in this glorious world! That I may have unceasing food, full of the glory of Mazda [^1469] and with which I am well pleased." {#XXIV:38}

'O Mazda! take for thyself the words of our praise: of these words I speak and speak again, the strength and victorious vigour, the power of health and healing, the fulness, increase, and growth. {#XXIV:39}

'Bring it together with the words of hymns up to the Garō-nmāna of Ahura Mazda. He will [^1470] first [pg 339] enter there. Therefore do thou pronounce these prayers.

_'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

#### VI.

'Converse ye with the Amesha-Speṇtas,' said Zarathuśtra unto the young king Vīśtāspa, and with the devout Sraosha, and Nairyō-sangha, the tall-formed, and Ātar, the son of Ahura Mazda, and the well-desired kingly Glory. {#XXIV:40}

'Men with lustful deeds address the body [^1471]; but thou, all the night long, address the heavenly Wisdom [^1472]; but thou, all night long, call for the Wisdom that will keep thee awake. {#XXIV:41}

'Three times a day raise thyself up and go to take care of the beneficent cattle.

'Of these men may the lordship [^1473] belong to the wisest of all beings, O Zarathuśtra! May their lord belong to the wisest, O Zarathuśtra! Let him show them the way of holiness, let him show them at once the way thereto, which the Law of the worshippers of Mazda enters victoriously. Thus the soul of man, in the joy of perfect holiness, walks over the bridge, known afar, the powerful Cinvaṭ-bridge [^1474], the well-kept, and kept by virtue. {#XXIV:42}

'How the worlds were arranged was said to thee first, O Zarathuśtra! Zarathuśtra said it again to the young king Vīśtāspa; therefore do thou [^1475] praise him [^1476] who keeps and maintains the moon and the sun. {#XXIV:43}

[pg 340]

'He who has little friendship for the Law, I have placed him down below to suffer.'

Thus said Angra Mainyu, he who has no Glory in him, who is full of death: 'This is an unbeliever, let us throw him down below; this is a liar, or a traitor to his relatives, and like a mad dog who wounds cattle and men; but the dog who inflicts wounds pays for it as for wilful murder [^1477]. {#XXIV:44}

'The first time he shall smite a faithful man, the first time he shall wound a faithful man, he shall pay for it as for wilful murder.

'Mayest thou receive [^1478], O holy young king Vīśtāspa! (a house) with a hundred . . . . [^1479], ten thousand large windows, ten thousand small windows, all the year long [^1480], O holy Vīśtāspa! never growing old, never dying, never decaying, never rotting, giving plenty of meat, plenty of food, plenty of clothes to the other worshippers of Mazda. {#XXIV:45}

'May all boons be bestowed upon thee, as I proclaim it unto thee! May the Amesha-Speṇtas impart to thee their brightness and glory and plenty [^1481]! May they give him quick and swift horses and good sons, strong, great in all things, powerful to sing the hymns. {#XXIV:46}

[pg 341]

'He wields his power according to the wish of Ahura Mazda, the Good Spirit, and for the destruction of the Evil Spirit, whichever of two men goes quicker to perform a sacrifice (to Ahura); but if he chooses to perform the sacrifice and prayer to us not in the right way, he does not wield the right power, he will not reign [^1482]. {#XXIV:47}

'He will receive bad treatment in the next world, though he has been the sovereign of a country, with good horses to ride and good chariots to drive. Give royalty to that man, O Zarathuśtra! who gives royalty unto thee with good will [^1483]. {#XXIV:48}

 [^1484]. 'Thou shalt keep away the evil by this holy spell: "Of thee \[O child!\] I will cleanse the birth and growth; of thee \[O woman!\] I will make the body and the strength pure; I make thee a woman rich in children and rich in milk; a woman rich in seed, in milk, and in offspring. For thee I shall make springs run and flow towards the pastures that will give food to the child." {#XXIV:49}

'Do not deliver me [^1485] into the hands of the fiend [^1486]; if the fiend take hold of me, then fever with loss of all joy will dry up the milk of the good Speṇta-Ārmaiti [^1487]. The fiend is powerful to distress, and to dry up the milk of the woman who indulges in lust and of all females. {#XXIV:50}

'The perfume of fire, pleasant to the Maker, [pg 342] Ahura Mazda, takes them [^1488] away from afar; . . . . [^1489]; and all those that harm the creation of the Good Spirit are destroyed [^1490]; {#XXIV:51}

'Whom Mithra, and Rashnu Raziśta, and the Law of the worshippers of Mazda wish to be taken far away, longing for a man who is eager to perform and does perform the ceremonies he has been taught; . . . [^1491] {#XXIV:52}

_'Ashem Vohū: Holiness is the best of all good . . . ._

#### VIII [^1492].

'The words of the Vahiśtōiśti [^1493] Gātha are to be sung: "Happy is he, O holy Vīśtāspa! happy the man, whoever he be, to whom Ahura Mazda gives the full accomplishment of his wishes." {#XXIV:53}

'Where does his soul abide on that night [^1494]?'

Ahura Mazda answered: 'O my son, Frashaośtra! It takes its seat near the head, singing the Uśtavaiti Gātha and proclaiming happiness: "Happy is he, happy the man whoever he be!" {#XXIV:54}

'On the first night, his soul sits in Good Words [^1495]; [pg 343] on the second night, it sits in Good Deeds; on the third night, it goes along the ways (to Garō-nmāna).

'At the end of the third night, O my son, Frashaośtra! when the dawn appears, it seems to the soul of the faithful one as if it were brought amidst plants \[and scents: it seems as if a wind were blowing from the region of the south, from the regions of the south\] [^1496], a sweet-scented wind, sweeter-scented than any other wind in the world, and it seems to his soul as if he were inhaling that wind with the nose, and it asks, saying: "Whence does that wind blow, the sweetest-scented wind I ever inhaled with my nose?" {#XXIV:55}

'And it seems to him as if his own conscience were advancing to him in that wind, in the shape of a maiden fair, bright, white-armed, strong, tall-formed, high-standing, thick-breasted, beautiful of body, noble, of a glorious seed, of the size of a maid in her fifteenth year, as fair as the fairest things in the world. {#XXIV:56}

'And the soul of the faithful one addressed her, asking: "What maid art thou, who art the fairest maid I have ever seen?" {#XXIV:57}

'And she, being his own conscience, answers him: "O thou youth, of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion! I am thy own conscience. {#XXIV:58}

' "Everybody did love thee for that greatness, goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength, and freedom from sorrow, in which thou [pg 344] dost appear to me; \[and so thou, O youth of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, of good religion! didst love me for that greatness, goodness, fairness, sweet-scentedness, victorious strength, and freedom from sorrow, in which I appear to thee.

' "When thou wouldst see a man [^1497]\] making derision and deeds of idolatry, or rejecting (the poor) and shutting (his door), then, thou wouldst sit, singing the Gāthas, and worshipping the good waters, and Ātar, the son of Ahura Mazda, and rejoicing the faithful that would come from near or from afar. {#XXIV:59}

' "I was lovely, and thou madest me still lovelier; I was fair, and thou madest me still fairer; I was desirable, and thou madest me still more desirable; I was sitting in a forward place, and thou madest me sit in the foremost place, through this good thought, through this good speech, through this good deed of thine; and so henceforth men worship me for my having long sacrificed unto and conversed with Ahura Mazda." {#XXIV:60}

'The first step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Thought Paradise; the second step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Word Paradise; the third step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Good-Deed Paradise; the fourth step that the soul of the faithful man made, placed him in the Endless Light. {#XXIV:61}

'Then one of the faithful, who had departed before him, asked, saying: "How didst thou depart this life, thou holy man? How didst thou come, [pg 345] thou holy man! from the abodes full of cattle and full of the wishes and enjoyments of love? from the material world into the world of the spirit? from the decaying world into the undecaying one? How long did thy felicity last?" ' {#XXIV:62}

And Ahura Mazda answered: 'Ask him not what thou askest him, who has just gone the dreary way, full of fear and distress, when the body and the soul part from one another. {#XXIV:63}

'\[Let him eat\] of the food brought to him, of the oil of Zaremaya: this is the food for the youth of good thoughts, of good words, of good deeds, of good religion, after he has departed this life; this is the food for the holy woman, rich in good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, well-principled, and obedient to her husband, after she has departed this life.' {#XXIV:64}

Spitama Zarathuśtra said to the young king Vīśtāspa: 'To what land shall I turn, O Ahura Mazda? To whom shall I go with praying [^1498]? {#XXIV:65}

[^1403]: Peshōtanu was a son of Vīśtāspa: Zarathuśtra made him drink of a certain sort of milk, and 'he forgot death.' He is one of the seven immortals, and reigns in Kangdež (Zartusht-Namah and Bundahiś XXIX, 5).

Comm.).

I cannot make anything of these words, nor reconcile them with the Pahlavi translation: 'It is not fair when he wishes weal for his own person; that is to say, when, being satisfied himself, he does not satisfy other people and wishes comfort for himself. (Make the Law of Mazda current, till the time when) the victorious Sōshyōsh will make it current.' The last three Zend words appear to be abridged from a longer passage.
