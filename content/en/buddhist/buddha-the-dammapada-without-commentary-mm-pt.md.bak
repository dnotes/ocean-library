## THE DHAMMAPADA

### CHAPTER I - THE TWIN-VERSES

All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage. {#1} [pg 4]

[^fn_3_1]: Dharma, though clear in its meaning, is difficult to translate. It has different meanings in different systems of philosophy, and its peculiar application in the phraseology of Buddhism has been fully elucidated by Burnouf, Introduction à l'Histoire du Buddhisme, p. 41 seq. He writes: 'Je traduis ordinairement ce terme par condition, d'autres fois par lois, mais aucune de ces traductions n'est parfaitement complète; il faut entendre par dharma ce qui fait qu'une chose est ce qu'elle est, ce qui constitue sa nature propre, comme l'a bien montré Lassen, à l'occasion de la célèbre formule, "Ye dharmâ hetuprabhavâ."' Etymologically the Latin for-ma expresses the same general idea which was expressed by dhar-ma. See also Burnouf, Lotus de la bonne Loi, p. 524. Fausböll translates: 'Naturae a mente principium ducunt,' which shows that he rightly understood dharma in the Buddhist sense. Gogerly (see Spence Hardy, Eastern Monachism, p. 28) translates: 'Mind precedes action,' which, if not wrong, is at all events wrongly expressed; while Professor Weber's rendering, 'Die Pflichten aus dem Herz folgern,' is quite inadmissible. D'Alwis (Buddhist Nirwana, p. 70 seq.), following the commentary, proposes to give a more technical interpretation of this verse, viz. 'Mind is the leader or all its faculties. Mind is the chief (of all its faculties). The very mind is made up of those (faculties). If one speaks or acts with a polluted mind, then affliction follows him as the wheel follows the feet of the bearer (the bullock).' To me this technical acceptation seems not applicable here, where we have to deal with the simplest moral precepts, and not with psychological niceties of Buddhist philosophy. It should be stated, however, that Childers, who first (s.v. dhamma) approved of my translation, seems afterwards to have changed his opinion. On p. 120 of his excellent Pâli Dictionary he said: 'Three of the five khandhas, viz. vedanâ, sa*ññ*â, and sankhâra, are collectively termed dhammâ (plur.), "mental faculties," and in the first verse of Dhammapada the commentator takes the word dhammâ to mean those three faculties. But this interpretation appears forced and unnatural, and I look upon Dr. Max Müller's translation, "All that we are is the result of what we have thought," as the best possible rendering of the spirit of the phrase mano pubbangamâ dhammâ.' But on p. 577 the same scholar writes: 'Of the four mental khandhas the superiority of vi*ññ*â*n*a is strongly asserted in the first verse of Dhammapada, "The mental faculties (vedanâ, sa*ññ*â, and sankhâra) are dominated by Mind," they are governed by Mind, they are made up of Mind." That this is the true meaning of the passage I am now convinced; see D'Alwis, Nirwana, pp. 70-75.' I do not deny that this may have been the traditional interpretation, at all events since the days of Buddhaghosa, but the very legend quoted by Buddhaghosa in illustration of this verse shows that its simpler and purely moral interpretation was likewise supported by tradition, and I therefore adhere to my original translation.

> 2. All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.

[^fn_4_2]: See Beal, Dhammapada, p. 169.

> 3. 'He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,'--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.

[^fn_4_3]: On akko*kkh*i, see Ka*kk*âyana VI, 4, 17. D'Alwis, Pâli Grammar, p. 38 note, 'When akko*kkh*i means "he abused," it is derived from kru*s*, not from krudh.' See Senart, Ka*kk*âyana, I. c. 

> 4. 'He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,'--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease. [pg 5]

> 5. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is an old rule.

> 6. The world does not know that we must all come to an end here; but those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.

[^fn_5_6]: Pare is explained by 'fools,' but it has that meaning by implication only. It is {Greek: *oi pólloi*}, cf. Vinaya, ed. Oldenberg, vol. i., p. 5, l. 4. Yamâmase, a 1 pers. plur. imp. Âtm., but really a Le*t* in Pâli. See Fausböll, Five *G*âtakas, p. 38.

> 7. He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled, immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mâra (the tempter) will certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.

[^fn_5_7]: Mâra must be taken in the Buddhist sense of 'tempter,' or 'evil spirit.' See Burnouf, Introduction, p. 76: 'Mâra est le démon de l'amour, du péché et de la mort; c'est le tentateur et l'ennemi de Buddha.' As to the definite meaning of vîrya, see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 548.

> 8. He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mâra will certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.

> 9. He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of the yellow dress.

[^fn_5_9]: The dark yellow dress, the Kâsâva or Kâshâya, is the distinctive garment of the Buddhist priests. See Vish*n*u-sûtra LXIII, 36. The play on the words anikkasâvo kâsâvam, or in Sanskrit anishkashâya*h* kâshâyam, cannot be rendered in English. Kashâya means 'impurity,' nish-kashâya, 'free from impurity,' anish-kashâya, 'not free from impurity,' while kâshâya is the name of the yellowish Buddhist garment. The pun is evidently a favourite one, for, as Fausböll shows, it occurs also in the Mahâbhârata, XII, 568:  
          
> Anishkashâye kâshâyam îhârtham iti viddhi tam,  
> Dharmadhva*g*ânâ*m* mu*nd*ânâ*m* v*ri*ttyartham iti me mati*h*.  

'Know that this yellow-coloured garment on a man who is not free from impurity, serves only for the purpose or cupidity; my opinion is, that it is meant to supply the means of living to those shavelings, who carry their virtue or the dharma like a flag.'

(I read v*ri*ttyartham, according to the Bombay edition, instead of k*ri*târtham, the reading of the Calcutta edition.)

On the exact colour of the dress, see Bishop Bigandet, The Life or Legend or Gaudama, the Budha of the Burmese, Rangoon, 1866, p. 504. Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. ii. p. 198. [pg 6]

In the Buddhistical Sanskrit, kusîda, 'idle,' is the exact counterpart of the Pâli kusîta; see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 548. On the change of Sanskrit d into Pâli t, see Kuhn, Beiträge zur Pali Grammatik, p. 40; Weber, Ind. Studien, XIII, p. 135.

> 10. But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of the yellow dress.

[^fn_6_10]: With regard to sîla, 'virtue,' see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 547.

> 11. They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.

11, 12. Sâra, which I have translated by 'truth,' has many meanings in Sanskrit. It means the sap of a thing, then essence or reality; in a metaphysical sense, the highest reality; in a moral sense, truth. It is impossible in a translation to do more than indicate the meaning of such words, and in order to understand them fully, we must know not only their definition, but their history. See Beal, Dhammapada, p. 64.

> 12. They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at truth, and follow true desires.

> 13. As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break through an unreflecting mind.

[^fn_6_13]: See Beal, Dhammapada, p. 65.

> 14. As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will not break through a well-reflecting mind.

> 15. The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he [pg 7] mourns in the next; he mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own work.

[^fn_6_15]: Kili*tth*a is klish*t*a, a participle of kli*s*. It means literally, what is spoilt. The abstract noun kle*s*a, 'evil or sin,' is contantly employed in Budddist works; see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 443.

   16. The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the purity of his own work.

[^fn_7_16]: Like klish*t*a in the preceding verse, vi*s*uddhi in the present has a technical meaning. One of Buddhaghosa's most famous works is called Visuddhi-magga. See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 844; Beal, Dhammapada, p. 67.

   17. The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he suffers more when going on the evil path.

17, 18. 'The evil path and the good path' are technical expressions for the descending and ascending scale of worlds through which all beings have to travel upward or downward, according to their deeds; see Bigandet; Life of Gaudama, p. 5, note 4, and p. 449; Burnouf, Introduction, p. 599; Lotus, p. 865, l. 7; l. 11. Fausböll translates 'heaven and hell,' which comes to the same; cf. vv. [126](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1011.htm#pp_126), [306] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1024.htm#pp_306).

   18. The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has done; he is still more happy when going on the good path.

   19. The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is like a cowherd counting the cows of others. [pg 8]

[^fn_7_19]: In taking sahitam in the sense of sa*m*hitam or sa*m*hitâ, I follow the commentator who says, Tepi*t*akassa Buddhava*k*anass' eta*m* nâma*m*, but I cannot find another passage where the Tipi*t*aka, or any portion of it, is called Sahita. Sa*m*hita in [vv. 100-102](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1010.htm#pp_100) has a different meaning. The fact that some followers of Buddha were allowed to learn short portions only of the sacred writings by heart, and to repeat them, while others had to learn a larger collection, is shown by the story of *K*akkhupâla, p. 3. of Mahâkâla, p. 26, &c. See Childers, s.v. sahita.

   20. The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness, possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.

[^fn_8_20]: Sâma*ññ*a, which I have rendered by 'priesthood,' expresses all that belongs to, or constitutes a real Sama*n*a or *S*rama*n*a, this being the Buddhist name corresponding to the Brâhma*n*a, or priest, of the orthodox Hindus. Buddha himself is frequently called the Good Sama*n*a. Fausböll takes the abstract word sâma*ññ*a as corresponding to the Sanskrit sâmânya, 'community,' but Weber has well shown that it ought to be taken as representing *s*râma*n*ya. He might have quoted the Sâma*ññ*a-phala-sutta, of which Burnouf has given such interesting details in his Lotus, p. 449 seq. Fausböll also, in his notes on v. 332, rightly explains sâma*ññ*atâ by *s*râma*n*yatâ. See Childers, s.v. sâma*ññ*a.

**CHAPTER II** [pg 9]

ON EARNESTNESS[^fn_9_1].

[^fn_9_1]: There is nothing in the tenth section of the Dhammapada, as translated by Beal, corresponding to the verses of this chapter.

> 21. Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvâ*n*a), thoughtlessness the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are thoughtless are as if dead already.

[^fn_9_21]: Apramâda, which Fausböll translates by 'vigilantia,' Gogerly by 'religion,' Childers by 'diligence,' expresses literally the absence of that giddiness or thoughtlessness which characterizes the state of mind of worldly people. It is the first entering into oneself, and hence all virtues are said to have their root in apramâda. (Ye ke*k*i kusalâ dhammâ sabbe te appamâdamûlakâ.) I have translated it by 'earnestness,' sometimes by 'reflection.' 'Immortality,' am*ri*ta, is explained by Buddhaghosa as Nirvâ*n*a. Am*ri*ta is used, no doubt, as a synonym of Nirvâ*n*a, but this very fact shows how many different conceptions entered from the very first into the Nirvâ*n*a of the Buddhists. See Childers, s.v. nibbâna, p. 269.

> 22. Those who are advanced in earnestness, having understood this clearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the knowledge of the Ariyas (the elect).

[^fn_9_22]: The Ariyas, the noble or elect, are those who have entered on the path that leads to Nirvâ*n*a; see Köppen, p. 396. Their knowledge and general status is minutely described; see Köppen, p. 436.

> 23. These wise people, meditative, steady, always possessed of strong powers, attain to Nirvâ*n*a, the highest happiness. [pg 10]

[^fn_9_23]: Childers, s.v. nibbâna, thinks that nibbâna here and in many other places means Arhatship.

This verse, as recited to A*s*oka; occurs in the Dîpava*m*sa VI, 53, and in the Mahâva*m*sa, p. 25. See also Sanatsu*g*âtîya, translated by Telang, Sacred Books of the East, vol. viii. p. 138.

> 24. If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not forgetful, if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he restrains himself, and lives according to law,--then his glory will increase.

> 25. By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the wise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.

[^fn_10_25]: Childers explains this island again as the state of an Arhat (arahatta-phalam).

> 26. Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps earnestness as his best jewel.

> 27. Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust! He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.

> 28. When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.

[^fn_10_28]: Cf. Childers, Dictionary, Preface, p. xiv. See Vinaya, ed. Oldenberg, vol. i. p. 5, s.f.

> 29. Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.

> 30. By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.

> 31. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with fear on thoughtlessness, [pg 11] moves about like fire, burning all his fetters, small or large.

[^fn_10_31]: Instead of saha*m*, which Dr. Fausböll translates by 'vincens,' Dr. Weber by 'conquering,' I think we ought to read *d*ahan, 'burning,' which was evidently the reading adopted by Buddhaghosa. Mr. R. C. Childers, whom I requested to see whether the MS. at the India Office gives saha*m* or *d*aha*m*, writes that the reading *d*aha*m* is as clear as possible in that MS. The fetters are meant for the senses. See [verse 370] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1027.htm#pp_370).

> 32. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he is close upon Nirvâ*n*a. [pg 12]

[^fn_11_1]: See Childers, Notes, p. 5.

**CHAPTER III**

THOUGHT.

> 33. As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man makes straight his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult to guard, difficult to hold back.

[^fn_12_33]: Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. i. p. 400.

> 34. As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on dry ground, our thought trembles all over in order to escape the dominion of Mâra (the tempter).

[^fn_12_34]: On Mâra, see [verses 7 and 8](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1003.htm#pp_7).

> 35. It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to hold in and flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind brings happiness.

35-39. Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. i. pp. 312, 400.

> 36. Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are difficult to perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list: thoughts well guarded bring happiness.

> 37. Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves about alone, is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the heart), will be free from the bonds of Mâra (the tempter).

> 38. If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not know the true law, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge will never be perfect.

> 39. If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if [pg 13] his mind is not perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil, then there is no fear for him while he is watchful. [pg 14]

[^fn_12_39]: Fausböll traces anavassuta, 'dissipated,' back to the Sanskrit root *s*yai, 'to become rigid;' but the participle of that root would be *s*îta, not *s*yuta. Professor Weber suggests that anavassuta stands for the Sanskrit anavasruta, which he translates unbefleckt, 'unspotted.' If avasruta were the right word; it might be taken in the sense of 'not fallen off, not fallen away,' but it could not mean 'unspotted;' cf. dhairya*m* no 'susruvat, 'our firmness ran away.' I have little doubt, however, that avassuta represents the Sanskrit ava*s*ruta, and is derived from the root *s*ru, here used in its technical sense, peculiar to the Buddhist literature, and so well explained by Burnouf in his Appendix XIV (Lotus, p. 820). He shows that, according to Hema*k*andra and the *G*ina-alankâra, â*s*ravakshaya, Pâli âsavasa*m*khaya is counted as the sixth abhi*gñ*â, wherever six of these intellectual powers are mentioned, instead of five. The Chinese translate the term in their Own Chinese fashion by 'stillationis finis,' but Burnouf claims for it the definite sense of destruction of faults or vices. He quotes from the Lalita-vistara (Adhyâya XXII, ed. Râjendra Lal Mittra, p. 448) the words uttered by Buddha when he arrived at his complete Buddhahood:--  
          
> *S*ushkâ â*s*ravâ na puna*h* *s*ravanti,  
> 'The vices are dried up, they will not flow again;'  
    
and he shows that the Pâli Dictionary, the Abhidhânappadîpikâ, explains âsava simply by kâma, 'love, pleasure of the senses.' In the Mahâparinibbâna-sutta, three classes of âsava are distinguished, the kâmâsavâ, the bhavâsavâ, and the avi*gg*âsavâ. See also Burnouf, Lotus, p. 665; Childers, s.v. âsavo.

That *s*ru means 'to run,' and is in fact a merely dialectic variety of sru, has been proved by Burnouf, while Boehtlingk thinks the substitution of *s* for s is a mistake. Â*s*rava therefore, or âsrava, meant originally 'the running out towards objects of the senses' (cf. sanga, âlara, &c.), and had nothing to do with âsrâva, 'a running, a sore,' Atharva-veda I, 2, 4. This conception of the original purport of â + *s*ru or ava-*s*ru is confirmed by a statement of Colebrooke's, who, when treating of the *G*ainas, writes (Miscellaneous Essays, I, 382); 'Âsrava is that which directs the embodied spirit (âsravayati purusham) towards external objects. It is the occupation and employment (v*ri*tti or pra*vr*itti) of the senses or organs on sensible objects. Through the means of the senses it, affects the embodied spirit with the sentiment of taction, colour, smell, and taste. Or it is the association or connection of body with right and wrong deeds. It comprises all the karmas, for they (âsravayanti) pervade, influence, and attend the doer, following him or attaching to him. It is a misdirection (mithyâ-prav*ri*tti) of the organs, for it is vain, a cause of disappointment, rendering the organs of sense and sensible objects subservient to fruition. Sa*m*vara is that which stops (sa*m*v*rin*oti) the course of the foregoing, or closes up the door or passage to it, and consists in self-command or restraint of organs internal and external, embracing all means of self-control and subjection of the senses, calming and subduing them.'

For a full account of the â*s*ravas, see Lalita-vistara, ed. Calc. pp. 445 and 552, where Kshî*n*â*s*rava is given as a name of Buddha. Â*s*râva occurs in Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtras II, 5, 9, where the commentator explains it by objects of the senses, by which the soul is made to run out. It is better, however, to take â*s*râva here, too, as the act of running out, the affections, appetites, passions. [pg 14]

> 40. Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and making this thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mâra (the tempter) with the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when conquered, and should never rest.

[^fn_14_40]: Anivesana has no doubt a technical meaning, and may signify, one who has left his house, his family and friends, to become a monk. A monk shall not return to his home, but travel about; he shall be anivesana, 'homeless,' anâgâra, 'houseless.' But I doubt whether this can be the meaning of anivesana here, as the sentence, let him be an anchorite, would come in too abruptly. I translate it therefore in a more general sense, let him not return or turn away from the battle, let him watch Mâra, even after he is vanquished, let him keep up a constant fight against the adversary, without being attached to anything or anybody.

> 41. Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth, despised, without understanding, like a useless log.

> 42. Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or [pg 15] an enemy to an enemy, a wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.

> 43. Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any other relative; a well-directed mind will do us greater service.

[^fn_15_43]: See Beal, Dhammapada, p. 73.

**CHAPTER IV** [pg 16]

FLOWERS[^fn_16_1].

[^fn_16_1]: See Beal, Dhammapada, p. 75.

> 44. Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama (the lord of the departed), and the world of the gods? Who shall find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower?

> 45. The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the world of the gods. The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower. [pg 17]

44, 45. If I differ from the translation of Fausböll and Weber, it is because the commentary takes the two verbs, vi*g*essati and pa*k*essati, to mean in the end the same thing, i.e. sa*kkh*i-karissati, 'he will perceive.' I have not ventured to take vi*g*essate for vi*g*anissati, though it should be remembered that the overcoming of the earth and of the worlds below and above, as here alluded to, is meant to be achieved by means of knowledge. Pa*k*essati, 'he will gather' (cf. vi-*k*i, Indische Sprüche, 4560), means also, like 'to gather' in English, 'he will perceive or understand,' and the dhammapada, or 'path of virtue,' is distinctly explained by Buddhaghosa as consisting of the thirty-seven states or stations which lead to Bodhi. (See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 430; Hardy, Manual, p. 497.) Dhammapada might, no doubt, mean also 'a law-verse,' and sudesita, 'well taught,' and this double meaning may be intentional here as elsewhere. Buddha himself is called Mârga-dar*s*aka and Mârga-de*s*ika (cf. Lal. Vist. p. 551). There is a curions similarity between these verses and verses 6540-41, and 9939 of the *S*ânti-parva:  
          
> Pushpâ*n*îva vi*k*invantam anyatragatamanasam,  
> Anavâpteshu kâmeshu m*ri*tyur abhyeti mânavam.  
    
'Death approaches man like one who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is turned elsewhere, before his desires have been fulfilled.'  
          
> Supta*m* vyâghra*m* mahaugho vâ m*ri*tyur âdâya ga*kkh*ati,  
> Sa*ñk*invânakam evaina*m* kâmânâm avit*ri*ptikam.  

'As a stream (carries off) a sleeping tiger, death carries off this man who is gathering flowers, and who is not satiated in his pleasures.'

This last verse, particularly, seems to me clearly a translation from Pâli, and the kam of sa*ñk*invânakam looks as if put in metri causâ.

> 46. He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of Mâra, and never see the king of death.

[^fn_17_46]: The flower-arrows of Mâra, the tempter, are borrowed from Kâma, the Hindu god of love. For a similar expression see Lalita-vistara, ed. Calc. p. 40, l. 20, mâyâmarî*k*isad*ri*sâ vidyutphenopamâ*s* *k*apalâ*h*. It is on account of this parallel passage that I prefer to translate marî*k*i by 'mirage,' and not by 'sunbeam,' as Fausböll, or by 'solar atom,' as Weber proposes. The expression, 'he will never see the king of death,' is supposed to mean Arhatship by Childers, s.v. nibbâna, p. 270.

> 47. Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

[^fn_17_47]: See Thiessen, Die Legende von Kisâgotamî, p. 9.

> 48. Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is distracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.

[^fn_17_48]: Antaka, 'death,' is given as an explanation of Mâra in the Amarakosha and Abhidhânappadîpika (cf. Fausböll, p. 210).

> 49. As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower, or its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in his village.

[^fn_17_49]: See Beal, Catena, p. 159, where vv. 49 and 50 are ascribed to Wessabhu, i.e. Vi*s*vabhû. See also Der Weise und der Thor, p. 134.

> 50. Not the perversities of others, not their sins [pg 18] of commission or omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice of.

> 51. Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the fine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.

[^fn_18_51]: [St. Matthew xxiii. 3] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/mat.htm#23:3), 'For they say, and do not.'

   52. But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.

   53. As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.

   54. The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallikâ flowers; but the odour of good people travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.

[^fn_18_54]: Tagara, a plant from which a scented powder is made. Mallaka or mallikâ, according to Benfey, is an oil vessel. Hence tagaramallikâ was supposed to mean a bottle holding aromatic powder, or oil made of the Tagara. Mallikâ, however, is given by Dr. Eitel (Handbook of Chinese Buddhism) as the name of a flower now called Casturi (musk) on account of its rich odour, and Dr. Morris informs me that he has found mallikâ in Pâli as a name of jasmine. See also Childers, s.v.; Notes, p. 6 ; and Beal, Dhammapada, p. 76.

   55. Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassikî, among these sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.

   56. Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.

   57. Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated [pg 19] through true knowledge, Mâra, the tempter, never finds the way.

   58., 59. As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.

[^fn_19_58]: 58, 59. Cf. Beal, Dhammapada, p. 76.

**CHAPTER V** [pg 20]

THE FOOL.

> 60. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.

[^fn_20_60]: 'Life,' sa*m*sâra, is the constant revolution of birth and death which goes on for ever until the knowledge of the true law or the true doctrine of Buddha enables a man to free himself from sa*m*sâra, and to enter into Nirvâ*n*a. See Buddhaghosha's Parables, Parable XIX, p. 134.

> 61. If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with a fool.

[^fn_20_61]: Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 46] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1033.htm#pp_46).

> 62. 'These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me,' with such thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how much less sons and wealth?

> 63. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.

[^fn_20_63]: Cf. Beal, Dhammapada, p. 77.

> 64. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.

> 65. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste of soup.

[^fn_20_65]: Cf. Beal, Dhammapada, p. 78.

> 66. Fools of little understanding have themselves [pg 21] for their greatest enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.

> 67. That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.

[^fn_21_67]: See Beal, l.c. p. 78.

> 68. No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.

> 69. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.

[^fn_21_69]: Taken from the Sa*m*yutta-nikâya, where, however, we read thânanhi instead of madhuvâ; see Feer, Comptes Rendus, 1871, p. 64.

> 70. Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the tip of a blade of Ku*s*a grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle of those who have well weighed the law.

[^fn_21_70]: The commentator clearly takes sankhâta in the sense of sankhyâta, 'reckoned,' for he explains it by *n*âtadhammâ, tulitadhammâ. The eating with the tip of Ku*s*a grass has reference to the fastings performed by the Brahmans, but disapproved of, except as a moderate discipline, by the followers of Buddha. This verse seems to interrupt the continuity of the other verses which treat of the reward of evil deeds, or of the slow but sure ripening of every sinful act. See Childers, s.v. sankhâto.

> 71. An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly); smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool. [pg 22]

[^fn_21_71]: I am not at all certain of the simile, unless mu*kk*ati, as applied to milk, can be used in the sense of changing or turning sour. In Manu IV, 172, where a similar sentence occurs, the commentators are equally doubtful: Nâdharma*s* *k*arito loke sadya*h* phalati gaur iva, 'for an evil act committed in the world does not bear fruit at once, like a cow;' or 'like the earth (in due season);' or 'like milk.' See Childers, Notes, p. 6.

> 72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.

[^fn_22_72]: I take *ñ*attam for *gñ*apitam, the causative of *gñ*âtam, for which in Sanskrit, too, we have the form without i, *gñ*aptam. This *gñ*aptam, 'made known, revealed,' stands in opppsition to the *kh*anna, 'covered, hid,' of the preceding verse. Sukka*m*sa, which Fausböll explains by *s*uklâ*m*sa, has probably a more technical and special meaning. Childers traces *ñ*attam to the Vedic *gñ*âtram, 'knowledge.' Fausböll refers to *G*âtaka, vol. i. p. 445, v. 118.

> 73. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!

> 74. 'May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be done or is not to be done,' thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire and pride increase.

> 75. 'One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads to Nirvâ*n*a;' if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this, he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the world. [pg 23]

[^fn_22_75]: Viveka, which in Sanskrit means chiefly understanding, has with the Buddhists the more technical meaning of separation, whether separation from the world and retirement to the solitude of the forest (kâya-viveka), or separalion from idle thoughts (*k*itta-viveka), or the highest separation and freedom (Nirvâ*n*a).

**CHAPTER VI**

THE WISE MAN (PA*ND*ITA).

> 76. If you see an intelligent man who tells you where true treasures are to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and administers reproofs, follow that wise man; it will be better, not worse, for those who follow him.

> 77. Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is improper!--he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.

> 78. Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of men.

[^fn_23_78]: It is hardly possible to take mitte kalyâ*n*e in the technical sense of kalyâ*n*a-mitra, 'ein geistlicher Rath,' a spiritual guide. Burnouf (Introd. p. 284) shows that in the technical sense kalyâ*n*a-mitra was widely spread in the Buddhist world.

> 79. He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage rejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).

[^fn_23_79]: Ariya, 'elect, venerable,' is explained by the commentator as referring to Buddha and other teachers.

> 80. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves. [pg 24]

[^fn_23_80]: See verses [33] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_33) and [145] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1012.htm#pp_145), the latter being a mere repetition of our verse. The nettikâs, to judge from the commentary and from the general purport of the verse, are not simply water-carriers, but builders of canals and aqueducts, who force the water to go where it would not go by itself. The Chinese translator says, 'the pilot manages his ship.' See Beal, l.c. p. 79.

> 81. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not amidst blame and praise.

> 82. Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.

> 83. Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle, longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people never appear elated or depressed.

[^fn_24_83]: The first line is very doubtful. I have adopted, in my translation, a suggestion of Mr. Childers, who writes, 'I think it will be necessary to take sabbattha in the sense of "everywhere," or "under every condition;" pa*ñk*akhandâdibhedesu, sabbadhammesu, says Buddhaghosha. I do not think we need assume that B. means the word vi*g*ahanti to be a synonym of va*g*anti. I would rather take the whole sentence together as a gloss upon the word va*g*anti:--va*g*antîti arahatta*ñ*ânena apaka*ddh*antâ *kh*andarâga*m* vi*g*ahanti; va*g*anti means that, ridding themselves of lust by the wisdom which Arhatship confers, they cast it away.' I am inclined to think the line means 'the righteous walk on (unmoved) in all the conditions of life.' Nindâ, pasa*m*sâ, sukha, dukkha are four of the eight lokadhammas, or earthly conditions; the remaining lokadhammas are lâbba, alâbha, yasa, ayasa.

In [v. 245] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_245), passatâ, 'by a man who sees,' means 'by a man who sees clearly or truly.' ln the same manner vra*g* may mean, not simply 'to walk,' but 'to walk properly,' or may be used synonymously with pravra*g*.

> 84. If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good, wise, and virtuous.

> 85. Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore. [pg 25]

[^fn_24_85]: 'The other shore' is meant for Nirvâ*n*a, 'this shore' for common life. On reaching Nirvâ*n*a, the dominion of death is overcome. The commentator supplies târitvâ, 'having crossed,' in order to explain the accusative ma*kk*udheyyam. Possibly pâram essanti should here be taken as one word, in the sense of overcoming.

> 86. But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to overcome.

> 87., 88. A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind.

[^fn_25_87-88]: Dark and bright are meant for bad and good; cf. [Sutta-nipâta, v. 526] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1035.htm#pp_526), and [Dhp. v. 167] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1015.htm#pp_167). Leaving one's home is the same as becoming a mendicant, without a home or family, an anâgâra, or anchorite. A man in that state of viveka, or retirement (see [v. 75] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1007.htm#pp_75), note), sees, that where before there seemed to be no pleasure there real pleasure is to be found, or vice versâ. A similar idea is expressed in [verse 99] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1009.htm#pp_99). See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 474, where he speaks of 'Le plaisir de la satisfaction, né de la distinction.'

> 89. Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of knowledge, who without clinging [pg 26] to anything, rejoice in freedom from attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of light, are free (even) in this world. [pg 27]

The five troubles or evils of the mind are passion, anger, ignorance, arrogance, pride; see Burnouf, Lotus, pp. 360, 443. As to pariyodapeyya, see [verse 183] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1016.htm#pp_183), and Lotus, pp. 523, 528; as to aki*ñk*ano, see Mahâbh. XII, 6568, 1240.

[^fn_25_89]: The elements of knowledge are the seven Sambodhvangas, on which see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 796. D'Alwis explains them as the thirty-seven Bodhipakkhiya-dhammâ. Khî*n*âsavâ, which I have translated by 'they whose frailties have been conquered,' may also be taken in a more metaphysical sense, as explained in the note to [v. 39](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_39). The same applies to the other terms occurring in this verse, such as âdâna, anupâdâya, &c. Dr. Fausböll seems inclined to take âsava in this passage, and in the other passages where it occurs, as the Pâli representative of â*s*raya. But â*s*raya, in Buddhist phraseology, means rather the five organs of sense with manas, 'the soul,' and these are kept distinct from the âsavas, 'the inclinations, the appetites, passions, or vices.' The commentary on the Abhidharma, when speaking of the Yogâ*k*âras, says, 'En réunissant ensemble les réceptacles (â*s*r ya), les choses reçues (â*s*rita) et les supports (âlambana), qui sont chacun composés de six termes, on a dix-huit termes qu'on appelle "Dhâtus" ou contenants. La collection des six réceptacles, ce sont les organes de la vue, de l'ouïe, de l'odorat, du goût, du toucher, et le "manas" (ou l'organe du coeur), qui est le dernier. La collection des six choses reçues, c'est la connaissance produite par la vue et par les autres sens jusqu'au "manas" inclusivement. La collection des six supports, ce sont la forme et les autres attributs sensibles jusqu'au "Dharma" (la loi ou l'être) inclusivement.' See Burnouf, Introduction, p. 449.

Parinibbuta is again a technical term, the Sanskrit pariniv*ri*ta meaning 'freed from all worldly fetters,' like vimukta. See Burnouf, Introduction, p. 590. See Childers, s.v. nibbâna, p. 270, and Notes on Dhammapada, p. 3; and D'Alwis, Buddhist Nirvâ*n*a, p. 75.\]

**CHAPTER VII**

THE VENERABLE (ARHAT).

> 90. There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all fetters.

> 91. They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they are not happy in their abode; like swans who have left their lake, they leave their house and home.

[^fn_27_91]: Satîmanto, Sanskrit sm*ri*manta*h*, 'possessed of memory,' but here used in the technical sense of sati, the first of the Bodhyangas. See Burnouf, Introduction, p. 797. Clough translates it by 'intense thought,' and this is the original meaning of smar, even in Sanskrit. See Lectures on the Science of Language, vol, ii. p. 332.

Uyyu*ñg*anti, which Buddhaghosa explains by 'they exert themselves,' seems to me to signify in this place 'they depart,' i.e. they leave their family, and embrace an ascetic life. See note to [verse 235] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_235). See also Rhys Davids, Mahâparinibbâna-sutta, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi. [p. 22] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe11/sbe1103.htm#page_22).

> 92. Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food, who have perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvâ*n*a), their path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air. [pg 28]

[^fn_27_92]: Su*ññ*ato and animitto are adjectives belonging to vimokho, one of the many names of Nirvâ*n*a, or, according to Childers, s.v. nibbâna, p, 270, Arhatship; see Burnouf, Introduction, pp. 442, 462, on *s*ûnya. The Sanskrit expression *s*ûnyatânimittâpra*n*ihitam occurs in L'enfant egaré, 5 a, l. 4. Nimitta is cause in the most general sense, i.e, what causes existence. The commentator explains it chiefly in a moral sense: Râgâdinimittâbhâvena animitta*m*, tehi *k*a vimuttan ti animitto vimokho, i.e. owing to the absence of passion and other causes, without causation; because freed from these causes, therefore it is called freedom without causation. See Childers, Pâli Dictionary, p. 270, col. 2, line 1.

The simile is intended to compare the ways of those who have obtained spiritual freedom to the flight of birds, it being difficult to understand how the birds move on without putting their feet on anything. This, at least, is the explanation of the commentator; The same metaphor occurs Mahâbh. XII, 6763. Childers translates, 'leaving no more trace of existence than a bird in the air.'

> 93. He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment, who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvâ*n*a), his path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.

> 94. The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by the driver, have been subdued, who is free from pride, and free from appetites.

> 95. Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth, like Indra's bolt; he is like a lake without mud; no new births are in store for him.

[^fn_28_95]: Without the hints given by the commentator, we should probably take the three similes of this verse in their natural sense, as illustrating the imperturbable state of an Arahanta, or venerable person. The earth is always represented as an emblem of patience; the bolt of Indra, if taken in its technical sense, as the bolt of a gate, might likewise suggest the idea of firmness; while the lake is a constant representative of serenity and purity. The commentator, however, suggests that what is meant is, that the earth, though flowers are cast on it,does not feel pleasure, nor the bolt of Indra displeasure, although less savoury things are thrown upon it; and that in like manner a wise person is indifferent to honour and dishonour.

> 96. His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has obtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus become a quiet man. [pg 29]

[^fn_28_96]: That this very natural threefold division, thought, word, and deed, the trividha-dvâra or the three doors of the Buddhists (Hardy, Manual, p. 494), was not peculiar to the Buddhists or unknown to the Brahmans, has been proved against Dr. Weber by Professor Köppen in his 'Religion des Buddha,' I, p. 445. He particularly called attention to Manu XII, 4-8; and he might have added Mahâbh. XII, 4059, 6512, 6549, 6554; XIII, 5677, &c. Dr. Weber has himself afterwards brought forward a passage from the Atharva-veda, VI, 96, 3 (ya*k* *k*akshushâ manasâ ya*k* *k*a vâ*k*â upârima), which, however, has a different meaning. A better one was quoted by him from the Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 12 (yan me manasâ, vâ*k*â, karma*n*â vâ dushk*ri*ta*m* k*ri*tam). Similar expressions have been shown to exist in the Zend-avesta, and among the Manichæans (Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, III, p. 414; see also Boehtlingk's Dictionary, s.v. kâya, and Childers, s.v. kâyo). There was no ground, therefore, for supposing that this formula had found its way into the Christian liturgy from Persia, for, as Professor Cowell remarks (Journal of Philology, vol. vii, p. 215), Greek writers, such as Plato, employ very similar expressions, e.g. Protag. p. 348, 30, {Greek: *pròs apan ergon kaì lógon kaì dianóhma*}. In fact, the opposition between words and deeds occurs in almost every writer, from Homer downwards;and the further distinction between thoughts and words is clearly implied even in such expressions as, 'they say in their heart.' That the idea of sin committed by thought was not a new idea, even to the Jews, may be seen from [Prov. xxiv. 9] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/pro.htm#24:9), 'the thought of foolishness is sin.' In the Âpastamba-sûtras, lately edited by Professor Bühler, we find the expression, atho yatki*ñk*a manasâ vâ*k*â *k*akshushâ vâ sankalpayan dhyâyaty âhâbhivipa*s*yati vâ tathaiva tad bhavatîtyupadi*s*anti, 'they say that whatever a Brahman intending with his mind, voice, or eye, thinks, says, or looks, that will be.' This is clearly a very different division, and it is the same which is intended in the passage from the Atharva-veda, quoted above. In the mischief done by the eye, we have, perhaps, the first indication of the evil eye. (Mahâbh. XII, 3417. See Dhammapada, [vv. 231-234] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1019.htm#pp_231).)

On the technical meaning of tâdi, see Childers, s.v. D'Alwis (p. 78) has evidently received the right interpretation, but has not understood it. Mâd*ri*sa also is used very much like tâd*ris*a, and from it mâriso, a venerable person, in Sanskrit mârsha.

> 97. The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the greatest of men. [pg 30]

> 98. In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land, wherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.

> 99. Forests are delightful; where the world finds no delight, there the passionless will find delight, for they look not for pleasures. [pg 31]

---

**CHAPTER VIII**

THE THOUSANDS.

> 100. Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word of sense is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

[^fn_31_100]: This Sahasravarga, or Chapter of the Thousands, is quoted by that name in the Mahâvastu (Minayeff, Mélanges Asiatiques, VI, p. 583): Teshâm Bhagavâ*ñ* *g*a*t*ilânâ*m* Dharmapadeshu sahasravargam bhâshati: 'Sahasram api vâkânâm anarthapadasa*m*hitânâm, ekârthavati *s*reyâ yâ*m* *s*rutvâ upa*s*âmyati. Sahasram api gâthânâm anarthapadasa*m*hitânâm, ekârthavati *s*reyâ yâ*m* *s*rutvâ upa*s*âmyati.' (MS. R. A. S. Lond.) Here the Pâli text seems decidedly more original and perfect.

> 101. Even though a Gâthâ (poem) be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word of a Gâthâ is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

> 102. Though a man recite a hundred Gâthâs made up of senseless words, one word of the law is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

> 103. If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if another conquer himself, he is the greatest of conquerors.

> 104., 105. One's own self conquered is better than all other people; not even a god, a Gandharva, not Mâra with Brahman could change into defeat the [pg 32] victory of a man who has vanquished himself, and always lives under restraint.

[^fn_31_104]: *G*ita*m*, according to the commentator, stands for *g*ito (lingavipallâso, i.e. viparyâsa); see also Senart in Journal Asiatique, 1880, p. 500.

The Devas (gods), Gandharvas (fairies), and other fanciful beings of the Brahmanic religion, such as the Nâgas, Sarpas, Garu*d*as, &c., were allowed to continue in the traditional language of the people who had embraced Buddhism. See the pertinent remarks of Burnouf, Introduction, pp. 134 seq., 184. On Mâra, the tempter, see v. 7. Sâstram Aiyar, On the *G*aina Religion, p. xx, says: 'Moreover as it is declared in the *G*aina Vedas that all the gods worshipped by the various Hindu sects, viz. *S*iva, Brahma, Vish*n*u, Ga*n*apati, Subramaniyan, and others, were devoted adherents of the above-mentioned Tîrthankaras, the *G*ainas therefore do not consider them as unworthy of their worship; but as they are servants of Arugan, they consider them to be deities of their system, and accordingly perform certain pû*g*âs in honour of them, and worship them also.' The case is more doubtful with orthodox Buddhists. 'Orthodox Buddhists,' as Mr. D'Alwis writes (Attanagalu-vansa, p. 55), 'do not consider the worship of the Devas as being sanctioned by him who disclaimed for himself and all the Devas any power over man's soul. Yet the Buddhists are everywhere idol-worshippers. Buddhism, however, acknowledges the existence of some of the Hindu deities, and from the various friendly offices which those Devas are said to have rendered to Gotama, Buddhists evince a respect for their idols.' See also Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 162.

> 106. If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after month with a thousand, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years.

> 107. If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in the forest, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than sacrifice for a hundred years.

> 108. Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit, the whole of it is not worth a quarter (a farthing); reverence shown to the righteous is better. [pg 33]

> 109. He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged, four things will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.

[^fn_33_109]: Dr. Fausböll, in a most important note, called attention to the fact that the same verse, with slight variations, occurs in Manu. We there read, II, 121:  
          
> Abhivâdana*s*îlasya nitya*m* v*ri*ddhopasevina*h*,  
> *K*atvâri sampravardhante âyur vidyâ ya*s*o balam.  

Here the four things are, life, knowledge, glory, power.

In the Âpastamba-sûtras, I, 2, 5, 15, the reward promised for the same virtue is svargam âyus *k*a, 'heaven and long life.' It seems, therefore, as if the original idea of this verse came from the Brahmans, and was afterwards adopted by the Buddhists. How largely it spread is shown by Dr. Fausböll from the Asiatic Researches, XX, p. 259, where the same verse of the Dhammapada is mentioned as being in use among the Buddhists of Siam.

> 110. But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life of one day is better if a man is virtuous and reflecting.

> 111. And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life of one day is better if a man is wise and reflecting.

> 112. And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a life of one day is better if a man has attained firm strength.

> 113. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing beginning and end, a life of one day is better if a man sees beginning and end.

> 114. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the immortal place, a life of one day is better if a man sees the immortal place.

> 115. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the highest law, a life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law. [pg 34]

**Chapter IX**

Evil.

> 116. If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his mind delights in evil.

> 117. If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.

> 118. If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in it: happiness is the outcome of good.

> 119. Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer see evil.

> 120. Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see happy days.

> 121. Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by little.

> 122. Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little by little.

> 123. Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions and carries much wealth, [pg 35] avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves life avoids poison.

> 124. He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand; poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one who does not commit evil.

> 125. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.

[^fn_35_125]: Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 661] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1035.htm#pp_661); Indische Sprüche, 1582; Kathâsaritsâgara, 49, 222.

> 126. Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvâ*n*a.

[^fn_35_126]: For a description of hell and its long, yet not endless sufferings, see Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 132. The pleasures of heaven, too, are frequently described in these Parables and elsewhere. Buddha himself enjoyed these pleasures of heaven, before he was born for the last time. It is probably when good and evil deeds are equally balanced, that men are born again as human beings; this, at least, is the opinion of the *G*ainas. Cf. Chintâma*n*i, ed. H. Bower, Introd. p. xv.

> 127. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).

> 128. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).  [pg 36]

**CHAPTER X**

PUNISHMENT.

> 129. All men tremble at punishment, all men fear death; remember that you are like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.

[^fn_36_129]: One feels tempted, no doubt, to take upama in the sense of 'the nearest (der Nächste), the neighbour,' and to translate, 'having made oneself one's neighbour,' i.e. loving one's neighbour as oneself. But as upamäm, with a short a, is the correct accusative of upamâ, we must translate, 'having made oneself the likeness, the image of others, having placed oneself in the place of others.' This is an expression which occurs frequently in Sanskrit; cf. Hitopade*s*a I, 11:  
          
> Prâ*n*â yathâtmano 'bhîsh*t*â bhûtânâm api te tathâ,  
> Âtmaupamyena bhûteshu dayâ*m* kurvanti sâdhava*h*.  
    
'As life is dear to oneself, it is dear also to other living beings: by comparing oneself with others, good people bestow pity on all beings.'

See also Hit. I, 12; Râm. V, 23, 5, âtmânam upamâ*m* k*ri*tvâ sveshu dâreshu ramyatâm, 'making oneself a likeness, i.e. putting oneself in the position of other people, it is right to love none but one's own wife.' Dr. Fausböll has called attention to similar passages in the Mahâbhârata, XIII, 5569 seq.

> 130. All men tremble at punishment, all men love life; remember that thou art like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.

[^fn_36_130]: Cf. [St. Luke vi. 31] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/luk.htm#6:31).

> 131. He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills beings who also long for happiness, will not find happiness after death. [pg 37]

[^fn_36_131]: Dr. Fausböll points out the striking similarity between this verse and two verses occurring in Manu and the Mahâbhârata:--  

Manu V, 45:  
          
> Yo 'hi*m*sakâni bhûtâni hinasty âtmasukhe*kkh*ayâ,  
> Sa *g*iva*ms* *k*a m*ri*tas *k*aiva na kva*k*it sukham edhate.  
    
Mahâbhârata XIII, 5568:  

> Ahi*m*sakâni bhûtâni da*nd*ena vinihanti ya*h*,  
> Âtmana*h* sukham i*kkh*an sa pretya naiva sukhî bhavet.  
    
If it were not for ahi*m*sakâni, in which Manu and the Mahâbhârata agree, I should say that the verses in both were Sanskrit modifications of the Pâli original. The verse in the Mahâbhârata presupposes the verse of the Dhammapada.

> 132. He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or kill beings who also long for happiness, will find happiness after death.

> 133. Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are spoken to will answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful, blows for blows will touch thee.

[^fn_37_133]: See Mahâbhârata XII, 4056.

> 134. If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter not, then thou hast reached Nirvâ*n*a; contention is not known to thee.

[^fn_37_134]: See Childers, s.v. nibbâna, p. 270, and s.v. kâ*m*so; D'Alwis, Buddhist Nirvâ*n*a, p. 35.

> 135. As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable, so do Age and Death drive the life of men.

> 136. A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds: but the wicked man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.

[^fn_37_136]: The metaphor of 'burning' for 'suffering' is very common in Buddhist literature. Everything burns, i.e. everything suffers, was one of the first experiences of Buddha himself. See [v. 146] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1013.htm#pp_146).

> 137. He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless persons, will soon come to one of these ten states: [pg 38]

> 138. He will have cruel suffering, loss, injury of the body, heavy affliction, or loss of mind,

[^fn_38_138]: 'Cruel suffering' is explained by sîsaroga, 'headache,' &c. 'Loss' is taken for loss of money. 'Injury of the body' is held to be the cutting off of the arm, and other limbs. 'Heavy afflictions' are, again, various kinds of diseases.

> 139. Or a misfortune coming from the king, or a fearful accusation, or loss of relations, or destruction of treasures,

[^fn_38_139]: Upasarga means 'accident, misfortune.' Dr. Fausböll translates râ*g*ato va upassaggam by 'fulgentis (lunae) defectionem;' Dr. Weber by 'Bestrafung vom König;' Beal by 'some governmental difficulty.' Abbhakkhânam, Sanskrit abhyâkhyânam, is a heavy accusation for high treason, or similar offences. Beal translates, 'some false accusation.' The 'destruction of pleasures or treasures' is explained by gold being changed to coals (see Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 98; Thiessen, Kisâgotamî, p. 6), pearls to cotton seed, corn to potsherds, and by men and cattle becoming blind, lame, &c.

> 140. Or lightning-fire will burn his houses; and when his body is destroyed, the fool will go to hell.

> 141. Not nakedness, not platted hair, not dirt, not fasting, or lying on the earth, not rubbing with dust, [pg 39] not sitting motionless, can purify a mortal who has not overcome desires.

[^fn_38_141]: Cf. Hibbert Lectures, p. 355. Dr. Fausböll has pointed out that the same or avery similar verse occurs in a legend taken from the Divyâvadâna, and translated by Burnouf (Introduction, p. 313 seq.) Burnouf translates the verse: 'Ce n'est ni la coutume de marcher nu, ni les cheveux nattés, ni l'usage d'argile, ni le choix des diverses espèces d'aliments, ni l'habitude de coucher sur la terre nue, ni la poussière, ni la malpropreté, ni l'attention à fuir l'abri d'un toit, qui sont capables de dissiper le trouble dans lequel nous jettent les désirs non-satisfaits; mais qu'un homme, maître de ses sens, calme, recueilli, chaste, évitant de faire du mal à aucune créature, accomplisse la Loi, et il sera, quoique paré d'ornements, un Brâhmane, un Çramana, un Religieux.' See also [Suttanipâta, v. 248]    (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_248).

Walking naked and the other things mentioned in our verse are outward signs of a saintly life, and these Buddha rejects because they do not calm the passions. Nakedness he seems to have rejected on other grounds too, if we may judge from the Sumâgadhâ-avadâna: 'A number of naked friars were assembled in the house of the daughter of Anâtha-pi*nd*ika. She called ber daughter-in-law, Sumâgadhâ, and said, "Go and see those highly respectable persons." Sumâgadhâ, expecting to see some of the saints, like *S*âriputra, Maudgalyâyana, and others, ran out full of joy. But when she saw these friars with their hair like pigeon wings, covered by nothing but dirt, offensive, and looking like demons, she became sad. "Why are you sad?" said her mother-in-law. Sumâgadhâ replied, "O mother, if these are saints, what must sinners be like?"

Burnouf (Introduction, p. 312) supposed that the *G*ainas only, and not the Buddhists, allowed nakedness. But the *G*ainas, too, do not allow it universally. They are divided into two parties, the *S*vetambaras and Digambaras. The *S*vetambaras, clad in white, are the followers of Par*s*vanâtha, and wear clothes. The Digambaras, i.e. sky-clad, disrobed, are followers of Mahâvîra, resident chiefly in Southern India. At present they, too, wear clothing, but not when eating. See Sâstram Aiyar, p. xxi.

The *g*a*t*â, or the hair platted and gathered up in a knot, was a sign of a *S*aiva ascetic. The sitting motionless is one of the postures assumed by ascetics. Clough explains ukku*t*ika as 'the act of sitting on the heels;' Wilson gives for utka*t*ukâsana, 'sitting on the hams.' See Fausböll, note on verse 140.

> 142. He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity, is quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to find fault with all other beings, he indeed is a Brâhma*n*a, an ascetic (*s*rama*n*a), a friar (bhikshu).

[^fn_39_142]: As to da*nd*anidhâna, see Mahâbh. XII, 6559, and [Sutta-nipâta, v. 34] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1033.htm#pp_34).

> 143. Is there in this world any man so restrained by humility that he does not mind reproof, as a well-trained horse the whip?

143, 144. I am very doubtful as to the real meaning of these verses. If their object is to show how reproof or punishment should be borne, my translation would be right, though alpabodhati in the sense of parvi facere is strange.

> 144. Like a well-trained horse when touched by [pg 40] the whip, be ye active and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof), perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.

> 145. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; good people fashion themselves. [pg 41]

---

**CHAPTER XI**

OLD AGE.

> 146. How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?

> 147. Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds, joined together, sickly, full of many thoughts, which has no strength, no hold!

> 148. This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death. [pg 42]

[^fn_41_148]: Dr. Fausböll informs me that Childers proposed the emendation mara*n*anta*m* hi *g*îvita*m*. The following extract from a letter, addressed by Childers to Dr. Fausböll, will be read with interest:--'As regards Dhp. v. 148, I have no doubt whatever. I quite agree with you that the idea (mors est vita ejus) is a profound and noble one, but the question is, Is the idea there? I think not. Mara*n*a*m* tamhi *g*îvita*m* is not Pâli, I mean not a Pâli construction, and years ago even it grated on my ear as a harsh phrase. The reading of your MSS. of the texts is nothing; your MSS. of Dhammapada are very bad ones, and it is merely the vicious Sinhalese spelling of bad MSS., like kamma*m*ta*m* for kammanta*m*. But the comment sets the question at rest at once, for it explains mara*n*anta*m* by mara*n*apariyosâna*m*, which is exactly the same. I see there is one serious difficulty left, that all your MSS. seem to have tamhi, and not ta*m* hi; but are you sure it is so? There was a Dhammapada in the India Office Library, and I had a great hunt for it a few days ago, but to my deep disappointment it is missing. I do not agree with you that the sentence "All Life is bounded by Death," is trivial: it is a truism, but half the noblest passages in poetry are truisms, and unless I greatly mistake, this very passage will be found in many other literatures.'

Dr. Fausböll adds:--

'I have still the same doubt as before, because of all my MSS. reading mara*n*a*m* tamhi. I do not know the readings of the London MSS. The explanation of the commentary does not settle the question, as it may as well be considered an explanation of my reading as of the reading which Childers proposed.--V. FAUSBÖLL.'

> 149. Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what pleasure is there in looking at them?

[^fn_42_149]: In the Rudrâya*n*âvadâna of the Divyâvadâna this verse appears as,  

> Yânîmâny apariddhâni vikshiptâni di*s*o di*s*a*h*,  
> Kapotavar*n*âny asthîni tâni d*ri*sh*t*vaiha kâ rati*h*. 

See Schiefner, Mél. Asiat. VIII, p. 589; *G*âtaka, vol. i. p. 322.

> 150. After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it is covered with flesh and blood, and there dwell in it old age and death, pride and deceit.

[^fn_42_150]: The expression ma*m*salohitalepanam is curiously like the expression used in Manu VI, 76, mâ*m*sa*s*o*n*italepanam, and in several passages of the Mahâbhârata, XII, 12462, 12053, as pointed out by Dr. Fausböll.

> 151. The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people never approaches destruction, thus do the good say to the good.

> 152. A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows, but his knowledge does not grow.

> 153., 154. Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him); and painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up [pg 43] this tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhâra, nirvâ*n*a), has attained to the extinction of all desires. [pg 44]

153, 154. These two verses are famous among Buddhists, for they are the words which the founder of Buddhism is supposed to have uttered at the moment he attained to Buddhahood. (See Spence Hardy, Manual; p. 180.) According to the Lalita-vistara, however, the words uttered on that solemn occasion were those quoted in the note to [verse 39] http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_39). In the commentary on the Brahma*g*âla this verse is called the first speech of Buddha, his last speech being the words in the Mabâparinibbâna-sutta, 'Life is subject to age; strive in earnest.' The words used in the Mahâparinibbâna-sutta, Chap. IV, 2, *K*atunna*m* dhammânam ananubodhâ appa*t*ivedhâ evam ida*m* dîgham addhâna*m* sandhâvita*m* sa*m*sârita*m* mama*ñ* *k*' eva tumhâka*ñ* *k*a, answer to the anticipation expressed in our verse.

The exact rendering of this verse has been much discussed, chiefly by Mr. D'Alwis in the Attanugaluvansa, p. cxxviii, and again in his Buddhist Nirvâ*n*a, p. 78; also by Childers, Notes on Dhammapada, p. 4, and in his Dictionary. Gogerly translated: 'Through various transmigrations I must travel, if I do not discover the builder whom I seek.' Spence Hardy: 'Through many different births I have run (to me not having found), seeking the architect of the desire-resembling house.' Fausböll: 'Multiplices generationis revolutiones percurreram, non inveniens, domus (corporis) fabricatorem quaerens.' And again (p. 322): 'Multarum generationum revolutio mihi subeunda esset, nisi invenissem domus fabricatorem.' Childers: 'I have run through the revolution of countless births, seeking the architect of this dwelling and finding him not.' D'Alwis: 'Through transmigrations of numerous births have I run, not discovering, (though) seeking the house-builder.' All depends on how we take sandhavissam, which Fausböll takes as a conditional, Childers, following Trenckner, as an aorist, because the sense imperatively requires an aorist. In either case, the dropping of the augment and the doubling of the s are, however, irregular. Sandhavissam is the regular form of the future, and as such I translate it, qualifying, however, the future, by the participle present anibbisan, i.e. not finding, and taking it in the sense of, if or so long as I do not find the true cause of existence. I had formerly translated anibbisan, as not resting (anirvi*s*an), but the commentator seems to authorise the meaning of not finding (avindanto, alabhanto), and in that case all the material difficulties of the verse seem to me to disappear.

'The maker of the tabernacle' is explained as a poetical expression for the cause of new births, at least according to the views of Buddha's followers, whatever his own views may have been. Buddha had conquered Mâra, the representative of worldly temptations, the father of worldly desires, and as desires (ta*m*hâ) are, by means of upâdâna and bhava, the cause of *g*âti, or 'birth,' the destruction of desires and the conquest of Mâra are nearly the same thing, though expressed differently in the philosophical and legendary language of the Buddhists. Ta*m*hâ,'thirst' or 'desire,' is mentioned as serving in the army of Mâra. (Lotus, p. 443.)

> 155. Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a lake without fish. [pg 45]

[^fn_44_155]: On *gh*âyanti, i.e. kshâyanti, see Dr. Bollensen's learned remarks, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XVIII, 834, and Boehtlingk-Roth, s.v. kshâ.

> 156. Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.

---

**CHAPTER XII**

SELF.

> 157. If a man hold himself dear, let him watch himself carefully; during one at least out of the three watches a wise man should be watchful.

[^fn_45_157]: The three watches of the night are meant for the three stages of life. Cf. [St. Mark xiii. 37] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/mar.htm#13:37), 'And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.'

> 158. Let each man direct himself first to what is proper, then let him teach others; thus a wise man will not suffer.

[^fn_45_158]: Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. ii. p. 441.

> 159. If a man make himself as he teaches others to be, then, being himself well subdued, he may subdue (others); one's own self is indeed difficult to subdue.

> 160. Self is the lord of self, who else could be the lord? With self well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find.

> 161. The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred, crushes the foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.

[^fn_45_161]: The Chinese translation renders va*g*iram by 'steel drill.'

> 162. He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state where his enemy wishes him to be, as a creeper does with the tree which it surrounds.

> 163. Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy to do; what is beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do. [pg 46]

> 164. The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable (Arahat), of the elect (Ariya), of the virtuous, and follows false doctrine, he bears fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of the Ka*tth*aka reed.

[^fn_46_164]: The reed either dies after it has borne fruit, or is cut down for the sake of its fruit.

Di*tth*i, literally 'view,' is used even by itself like the Greek 'hairesis,' in the sense of heresy (see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 444). In other places a distinction is made between mi*kkh*âdi*tth*i (vv. [167] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1015.htm#pp_167), [316](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1024.htm#pp_316)) and sammâdi*tth*i ([v. 319] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1024.htm#pp_319)). If arahata*m* ariyâna*m* are used in their technical sense, we should translate 'the reverend Arhats,'--Arhat being the highest degree of the four orders of Ariras, viz. Srotaâpanna, Sakadâgâmin, Anâgâmin, and Arhat. See note to [verse 178] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1015.htm#pp_178).

> 165. By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity belong to oneself, no one can purify another.

> 166. Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another's, however great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty, be always attentive to his duty. [pg 47]

[^fn_46_166]: Attha, lit. 'object,' must here be taken in a moral sense, as 'duty' rather than as 'advantage.' Childers rendered it by 'spiritual good.' The story which Buddhaghosa tells of the Thera Attadattha gives a clue to the origin of some of his parables, which seem to have been invented to suit the text of the Dhammapada rather than vice versâ. A similar case occurs in the commentary to verse 227.

**CHAPTER XIII**

THE WORLD.

> 167. Do not follow the evil law! Do not live on in thoughtlessness! Do not follow false doctrine! Be not a friend of the world.

> 168. Rouse thyself! do not be idle! Follow the law of virtue! The virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.

[fn_47_168-169]: See Rhys Davids, Buddhism, p. 65.

> 169. Follow the law of virtue; do not follow that of sin. The virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.

> 170. Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a mirage: the king of death does not see him who thus looks down upon the world.

[fn_47_170]: See [Suttanipâta, v. 1118] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1037.htm#pp_1118).

> 171. Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not touch it.

> 172. He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober, brightens up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.

> 173. He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.

> 174. This world is dark, few only can see here; a few only go to heaven, like birds escaped from the net.

> 175. The swans go on the path of the sun, they go through the ether by means of their miraculous [pg 48] power; the wise are led out of this world, when they have conquered Mâra and his train.

[fn_47_175]: Ha*m*sa may be meant for the bird, whether flamingo, or swan, or ibis (see Hardy, Manual, p. 17), but it may also, I believe, be taken in the sense of saint. As to iddhi, 'magical power,' i.e. *ri*ddhi, see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 310; Spence Hardy, Manual, pp. 498, 504; Legends, pp. 55, 177; and note to [verse 254] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_254).\]

> 176. If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies, and scoffs at another world, there is no evil he will not do.

> 177. The uncharitable do not go to the world of the gods; fools only do not praise liberality; a wise man rejoices in liberality, and through it becomes blessed in the other world.

> 178. Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the reward of the first step in holiness. [pg 49]

[^fn_48_178]: Sotâpatti, the technical term for the first step in thr path that leads to Nirvâ*n*a. There are four such steps, or stages, and on entering each, a man receives a new title:--

(1) The *S*rotaâpanna, lit. he who has got into the stream. A man may have seven more births before he reaches the other shore, i.e. Nirvâ*n*a.

(2) Sak*ri*dâgâmin, lit. he who comes back once, so called because, after having entered this stage, a man is born only once more among men or gods. Childers shows that this involves really two more births, one in the deva world, the other in the world of men: Burnouf says the same, Introduction, p. 293.

(3) Anâgâmin, lit. he who does not come back, so called because, after this stage, a man cannot be born again in a lower world; but can only be born into a Brahman world, before he reaches Nirvâ*n*a.

(4) Arhat, the venerable, the perfect, who has reached the highest stage that can be reached, and from which Nirvâ*n*a is perceived (sukkhavipassanâ, Lotus, p. 849). See Hardy, Eastern Monachism, p. 280; Burnouf, Introduction, p. 209; Köppen, p. 398; D'Alwis, Attanugaluvansa, p. cxxiv; Feer, Sutra en 42 articles, p. 6.

**CHAPTER XIV**

THE BUDDHA (THE AWAKENED).

> 179. He whose conquest is not conquered again, into whose conquest no one in this world enters, by what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?

> 180. He whom no desire with its snares and poisons can lead astray, by what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?

[^fn_49_179-180]: Buddha, the Awakened, is to be taken as an appellative rather than as the proper name of the Buddha (see v. 183). It means, anybody who has arrived at complete knowledge. Anantago*k*aram I take in the sense of, possessed of unlimited knowledge. Apadam, which Dr. Fausböll takes as an epithet of Buddha and translates by 'non investigabilis,' is translated 'trackless,' in order to show the play on the word pada; see Childers, s.v. The commentator says: 'The man who is possessed of even a single one of such conditions as râga, &c., him ye may lead forward; but the Buddha has not even one condition or basis of renewed existence, and therefore by what track will you lead this unconditioned Buddha?' Cf. Dhp. vv. [92] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1009.htm#pp_92), [420] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1028.htm#pp_420); and *G*âtaka, vol. i. pp. 79, 313.

> 181. Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not forgetful, who are given to meditation, who are wise, and who delight in the repose of retirement (from the world).

> 182. Difficult (to obtain) is the conception of men, difficult is the life of mortals, difficult is the hearing of the True Law, difficult is the birth of the Awakened (the attainment of Buddhahood). [pg 50]

[^fn_49_182]: Mr. Beal (Dhammapada, p. 110) states that this verse occurs in the Sûtra of the Forty-two Sections.\]

> 183. Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify one's mind, that is the teaching of (all) the Awakened.

[^fn_50_183]: This verse is again one of the most solemn verses among the Buddhists. According to Csoma Körösi, it ought to follow the famous Âryâ stanza, 'Ye dhammâ' (Lotus, p. 522), and serve as its complement. But though this may be the case in Tibet, it was not so originally. The same verse (ascribed to Kanakamuni) occurs at the end of the Chinese translation of the Prâtimoksha. (Beal, J. R. A. S. XIX, p. 473; Catena, p. 159); in the Tibetan translation of the Gâthâsangraha, v. 14 (Schiefner, Mél. Asiat. I VIII, pp. 568, 586; and Csoma Körösi, As. Res. XX, p. 79). Burnouf has fully discussed the metre and meaning of our verse on pp. 527, 528 of his 'Lotus.' He prefers sa*k*ittaparidamanam, which Csoma translated by 'the mind must be brought under entire subjection' (sva*k*ittaparidamanam), and the late Dr. Mill by 'proprii intellectus subjugatio.' But his own MS. of the Mahâpadhâna-sutta gave likewise sa*k*ittapariyodapanam, and this is no doubt the correct reading. (See D'Alwis, Attanugaluvansa, p. cxxix.) We found pariyodappeya in [verse 88] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1008.htm#pp_88), in the sense of purging oneself from the troubles of thought. From the same verb, (pari) ava + dai, we may derive the name Avadâna, a legend, originally a pure and virtuous act, an {Greek: *aridteia*}, afterwards a sacred story, and possibly a story the hearing of which purifies the mind. See Boehtlingk-Roth, s.v. avadâna.

> 184. The Awakened call patience the highest penance, long-suffering the highest Nirvâ*n*a; for he is not an anchorite (pravra*g*ita) who strikes others, he is not an ascetic (*s*rama*n*a) who insults others.

[^fn_50_184]: Childers, following the commentator, translates, 'Patience, which is long-suffering, is the best devotion, the Buddhas declare that Nirvâ*n*a is the best (of things).'

> 185. Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained under the law, to be moderate in eating, to sleep and sit alone, and to dwell on the highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the Awakened. [pg 51]

[^fn_50_185]: Cf. Suttanipâta, [v. 337] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1034.htm#pp_337). Pâtimokkhe, 'under the law,' i.e. according to the law, the law which leads to Moksha, or 'freedom.' Prâtimoksha is the title of the oldest collection of the moral laws of the Buddhists (Burnouf, Introduction, p. 300; Bigandet, The Life of Gaudama, p. 439; Rhys Davids, Buddhism, p. 162), and as it was common both to the Southem and the Northem Buddhists, pâtimokkhe in our passage may possibly be meant, as Professor Weber suggests, as the title of that very collection. The commentator explains it by ge*tth*akasîla and pâtimokkhasîla. Sayanâsam might stand for *s*ayanâ*s*anam, see Mahâbh. XII, 6684;but in Buddhist literature it is intended for *s*ayanâsanam; see also Mahâbh. XII, 9978, *s*ayyâsane. Fausböll now reads pânta instead of pattha*ñ*.

[^fn_50_187]: There is a curious similarity between this verse and verse 6503 (9919) of the *S*ântiparva:  
          
> Ya*k* *k*a kâmasukha*m* loke, ya*k* *k*a divyam mahat sukham,  
> T*ri*sh*n*âkshayasukhasyaite nârhata*h* sho*d*a*s*i*m* kalâm.

'And whatever delight of love there is on earth, and whatever is the great delight in heaven, they are not worth the sixteenth part of the pleasure which springs from the destruction of all desires.' The two verses 186, 187 are ascribed to king Mandhât*ri* shortly before his death (Mél. Asiat. VIII, p. 471; see also *G*âtaka, vol. ii. p. 113).

> 186. There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of gold pieces; he who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain, he is wise;

> 187. Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction, the disciple who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction of all desires.

> 188. Men, driven by fear, go to many a refuge, to mountains and forests, to groves and sacred trees.

[^fn_51_188-192]: These verses occur in Sanskrit in the Prâtihâryasûtra, translated by Burnouf, Introduction, pp. 162-189; see p. 186. Burnouf translates rukkha*k*etyâni by 'arbres consacrés;' properly, sacred shrines under or near a tree. See also *G*âtaka vol. i. p. 97.

> 189. But that is not a safe refuge, that is not the best refuge; a man is not delivered from all pains after having gone to that refuge.

> 190. He who takes refuge with Buddha, the Law, [pg 52] and the Church; he who, with clear understanding, sees the four holy truths:--

[^fn_51_190]: Budda, Dharma, and Sangha are called the Tri*s*ara*n*a (cf. Burnouf, Introd. p. 630). The four holy truths are the four statements that there is pain in this world, that the source of pain is desire, that desire can be annihilated, that there is a way (shown by Buddha) by which the annihilation of all desires can be achieved, and freedom be obtained. That way consists of eight parts. (See Burnouf, Introduction, p. 630.) The eightfold way forms the subject of Chapter XVIII. (See also Feer, Journal As. 1870, p. 418, and Chips from a German Workshop, 2nd ed. vol. i. p. 251 seq.)\]

> 191. Viz. pain, the origin of pain, the destruction of pain, and the eightfold holy way that leads to the quieting of pain;--

> 192. That is the safe refuge, that is the best refuge; having gone to that refuge, a man is delivered from all pain.

> 193. A supernatural person (a Buddha) is not easily found, he is not born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race prospers.

> 194. Happy is the arising of the awakened, happy is the teaching of the True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the devotion of those who are at peace.

> 195., 196. He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be measured by anybody. [pg 53]

---

**CHAPTER XV**

HAPPINESS.

> 197. Let us live happily then, not hating those who hate us! among men who hate us let us dwell free from hatred!

> 198. Let us live happily then, free from ailments among the ailing! among men who are ailing let us dwell free from ailments!

[^fn_53_198]: The ailment here meant is moral rather than physical. Cf. Mahâbh. XII, 9924, sa*m*pra*s*ânto nirâmaya*h*; 9925, yo 'sau prâ*n*ântiko rogas tâ*m* t*ri*sh*n*â*m* tya*g*ata*h* sukham.

> 199. Let us live happily then, free from greed among the greedy! among men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed!

> 200. Let us live happily then, though we call nothing our own! We shall be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness!

[^fn_53_200]: The words placed in the mouth of the king of Videha, while his residence Mithilâ was in flames, are curiously like our verse; cf. Mahâbh. XII, 9917,  
          
> Susukha*m* vata *g*îvâmi yasya me nâsti ki*ñk*ana,  
> Mithilâyâm pradîptâyâ*m* na me dahyati ki*ñk*ana.  
    
'I live happily, indeed, for I have nothing; while Mithilâ is in flames, nothing of mine is burning.' Cf. Muir, Religious sentiments, p. 106.

The âbhassara, i.e. âbhâsvara, 'the bright gods,' are frequently mentioned. Cf. Burnouf, Introd. p. 611.

> 201. Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has given up both victory and defeat, he, the contented, is happy. [pg 54]

[^fn_53_201]: This verse is ascribed to Buddha, when he heard of the defeat of A*g*âta*s*atru by Prasena*g*it. It exists in the Northern or Sanskrit and in the Southern or Pâli texts, i.e. in the Avadâna-*s*ataka, in the Sa*m*yutta-nikâya. See Feer, Comptes Rendus, 1871, p. 44. and Journal As. 1880, p. 509. In the Avadâna-*s*ataka, the Sanskrit version is--  
          
> *G*ayo vairam prasavati, du*h*kha*m* sete parâ*g*ita*h*  
> Upa*s*ânta*h* sukha*m* *s*ete hitvâ *g*ayaparâ*g*ayam.

> 202. There is no fire like passion; there is no losing throw like hatred; there is no pain like this body; there is no happiness higher than rest.

[^fn_54_202]: I take kali in the sense of an unlucky die which makes a player lose his game. A real simile seems wanted here, as in [verse 251] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_251), where, for the same reason, I translate graha by 'shark,' not by 'captivitas,' as Dr. Fausböll proposes. The same scholar translates kali in our verse by 'peccatum.' If there is any objection to translating kali in Pâli by 'unlucky die,' I should still prefer to take it in the sense of the age of depravity, or the demon of depravity. To judge from Abhidhânappadîpikâ, 1106, kali was used for parâ*g*aya, i.e. loss at game, a losing throw, and occurs in that sense again in [verse 252]  (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_252). The Chinese translation has, 'there is no distress (poison) worse than hate.' A similar verse occurs Mahâbh. *S*ântip. 175, v. 35.

'Body' for khandha is a free translation, but it is difficult to find any other rendering. The Chinese translation also has 'body.' According to the Buddhists each sentient being consists of five khandhas (skandha), or aggregates, the organized body (rûpakhandha) with its four internal capacities of sensation (vedanâ), perception (sa*ñgñ*â), conception (sa*m*skâra), knowledge (vi*gñ*âna). See Burnouf, Introd. pp. 589,634; Lotus, p. 335.

> 203. Hunger is the worst of diseases, the body the greatest of pains; if one knows this truly, that is Nirvâ*n*a, the highest happiness. [pg 55]

[^fn_54_203]: Sa*m*skâra is the fourth of the five khandhas, but the commentator takes it here, as well as in [verse 255] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_255), for the five khandhas together, in which case we can only translate it by 'body.' See also [verse 278] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1022.htm#pp_278). Childers proposes 'organic life'. (Notes on Dhammapada, p. 1). There is, however, another sa*m*skâra, that which follows inimediately upon avidyâ, 'ignorance,' as the second of the nidânas, or 'causes of existence,' and this too might be called the greatest pain, considering that it is the cause of birth, which is the cause of all pain. Sa*m*skâra seems sometimes to have a different and less techninal meaning, being used in the sense of conceptions, plans, desires, as, for instance, in [verse 368] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1027.htm#pp_368), where sankhârâna*m* khayam is used much like ta*m*hâkhaya. Again, in his comment on verse 75, Buddhaghosa says, upadhiviveko sankhârasanga*n*ika*m* vinodeti; and again, upadhiviveko *k*a nirupadhînâ*m* puggalâna*m* visankhâragatânâm.

For a similar sentiment, see Stanislas Julien, Les Avadânas, vol. i. p. 40, 'Le corps est la plus grande source de souffrance,' &c. I should say that the khandhas in verse 202 and the sankhâras in verse 203 are nearly, if not quite, synonymous. I should prefer to read *g*iga*kkh*â-paramâ as a compound. *G*iga*kkh*â, or as it is written in one MS., diga*kkh*â (Sk. *g*ighatsâ), means not only 'hunger,' but 'appetite; desire.'

> 204. Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches; trust is the best of relationships, Nirvâ*n*a the highest happiness.

[^fn_55_204]: Childers translates, 'the best kinsman is a man you can trust.'

> 205. He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity, is free from fear and free from sin, while he tastes the sweetness of drinking in the law.

[^fn_55_205]: Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 256] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1034.htm#pp_256).

> 206. The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with them is always happiness; if a man does not see fools, he will be truly happy.

> 207. He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way; company with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company with the wise is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.

> 208. Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the stars. [pg 56]

[^fn_55_208]: I should like to read sukho *k*a dhîrasa*m*vâso.

---

**CHAPTER XVI**

PLEASURE.

> 209. He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure, will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.

> 210. Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant. Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is unpleasant.

> 211. Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil. Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.

> 212. From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is free from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.

> 213. From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.

> 214. From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from lust knows neither grief nor fear.

[^fn_56_214]: See Beal, Catena, p. 200.

> 215. From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from love knows neither grief nor fear.

> 216. From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free from greed knows neither grief nor fear.

> 217. He who possesses virtue and intelligence, [pg 57] who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear.

> 218. He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvâ*n*a) has sprung up, who is satisfied in his mind, and whose thoughts are not bewildered by love, he is called ûrdhva*m*srotas (carried upwards by the stream).

[^fn_57_218]: Ûrdhva*m*srotas or uddha*m*soto is the technical name for one who has reached the world of the Av*ri*has (Aviha), and is proceeding to that of the Akanish*th*as (Akani*tth*a). This is the last stage before he reaches the formless world, the Arûpadhâtu. (See Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 123; Burnouf, Introduction, p. 599.) Originally ûrdhva*m*srotas may have been used in a less technical sense, meaning one who swims against the stream, and is not carried away by the vulgar passions of the world.

> 219. Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long away, and returns safe from afar.

> 220. In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and has gone from this world to the other;--as kinsmen receive a friend on his return. [pg 58]

---

**CHAPTER XVII**

ANGER.

> 221. Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name and form, and who calls nothing his own.

[^fn_58_221]: 'Name and form' or 'mind and body' is the translation of nâma-rûpa, the ninth of the Buddhist Nidânas. Cf. Burnouf, Introduction, p. 501; see also Gogerly, Lecture on Buddhism, and Bigandet, The Life of Gaudama, p. 454.

> 222. He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a real driver; other people are but holding the reins.

> 223. Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by good; let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth!

[^fn_58_223]: Mahâbh. XII, 3550, asâdhu*m* sadhunâ *g*ayet. Cf. Ten *G*âtakas, ed. Fausböll, p. 5.

> 224. Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.

> 225. The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body, they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvâ*n*a), where, if they have gone, they will suffer no more.

> 226. Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who strive after Nirvâ*n*a, their passions will come to an end.

> 227. This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of to-day: 'They blame him who sits silent, [pg 59] they blame him who speaks much, they also blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed.'

[^fn_58_227]: It appears from the commentary that porâ*n*am and a*gg*atanam are neuters, referring to what happened formerly and what happens to-day, and that they are not to be taken as adjectives referring to âsînam, &c. The commentator must have read atula instead of atulam, and he explains it as the name of a pupil whom Gautama addressed by that name. This may be so (see note to [verse 166]   (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1014.htm#pp_166)); but atula may also be taken in the sense of incomparable (Mahâbh. XIII, 1937), and in that case we ought to supply, with Professor Weber, some such word as 'saw' or 'saying.'

> 228. There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.

> 229., 230. But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the *G*ambû river? Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman.

[^fn_59_230]: The Brahman worlds are higher that the Deva worlds as the Brahman is higher than a Deva; see Hardy, Manual, p. 25; Burnouf, Introduction, pp. 134, 184.

> 231. Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the body, and with thy body practise virtue!

> 232. Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!

> 233. Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!

> 234. The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise who control their mind, are indeed well controlled. [pg 60]

---

**CHAPTER XVIII**

IMPURITY.

> 235. Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have come near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou hast no provision for thy journey.

[^fn_60_235]: Uyyoga seems to mean departure. See Buddhaghosa's commentary on verse 152, p. 319, l. 1; Fausböll, Five *G*âtakas, p. 35.

> 236. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the heavenly world of the elect (Ariya).

[^fn_60_236]: 'An island,' for a drowning man to save himself; (see verse 25.) Dîpankara is the name of one of the former Buddhas, and it is also used as an appellative of the Buddha, but is always derived from dîpo, 'a lamp.'

> 237. Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama), there is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou hast no provision for thy journey.

> 238. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into birth and decay.

> 239. Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith blows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by little, and from time to time.

[^fn_60_239]: This verse is the foundation of the thirty-fourth section of the Sûtra of the forty-two sections; see Beal, Catena, p. 201; [Sutta-nipâta, v. 962] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1036.htm#pp_962).

> 240. As the impurity which springs from the iron, [pg 61] when it springs from it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil path.

> 241. The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses, non- repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman, thoughtlessness.

> 242. Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a benefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and in the next.

> 243. But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is the greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become taintless!

> 244. Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.

[^fn_61_244]: Pakkhandin is identified by Dr. Fausböll with praskandin, one who jumps forward, insults, or, as Buddhaghosa explains it, one who meddles with other people's business, an interloper. At all events, it is a term of reproach, and, as it would seem, of theological reproach.

> 245. But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.

> 246. He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;

[^fn_61_246]: On the five principal commandments which are recapitulated in verses 246 and 247, see Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 153.

> 247. And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he, even in this world, digs up his own root.

> 248. O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long time! [pg 62]

[^fn_61_248]: Cf. Mahâbhârata XII, 4055, yeshâ*m* v*ri*ttis *k*a sa*m*yatâ. See also [verse 307]    (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1024.htm#pp_307).

> 249. The world gives according to their faith or according to their pleasure: if a man frets about the food and the drink given to others, he will find no rest either by day or by night.

[^fn_62_249]: This verse has evidently regard to the feelings of the Bhikshus or mendicants who receive either much or little, and who are exhorted not to be envious if others receive more than they themselves. Several of the Parables illustrate this feeling.

> 250. He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, finds rest by day and by night.

> 251. There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.

[^fn_62_251]: Dr. Fausböll translates gaho by 'captivitas,' Dr. Weber by 'fetter.' I take it in the same sense as grâha in Manu VI, 78; and Buddhaghosa does the same, though he assigns to grâha a more general meaning, viz. anything that seizes, whether an evil spirit (yakkha), a serpent (a*g*agara), or a crocodile (kumbhîla).

Greed or thirst is represented as a river in Lalita-vistara, ed. Calc. p. 482, trish*n*â-nadî tivegâ pra*s*oshitâ me *gñ*ânasûrye*n*a, 'the wild river of thirst is dried up by the sun of my knowledge.'

> 252. The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff, but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the gambler.

[^fn_62_252]: See Childers, Notes, p. 7; [St. Matthew vii. 3] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/kjv/mat.htm#7:3).

> 253. If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the destruction of passions.

[^fn_62_253]: As to âsava, 'appetite, passion,' see note to [verse 39] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_39).

> 254. There is no path through the air, a man is not a Sama*n*a  y outward acts. The world [pg 63] delights in vanity, the Tathâgatas (the Buddhas) are free from vanity.

[^fn_62_254]: I have translated this verse very freely, and not in accordance with Buddhaghosa's commentary. Dr. Fausböll proposed to translate, 'No one who is outside the Buddhist community can walk through the air, but only a Sama*n*a;' and the same view is taken by Professor Weber, though he arrives at it by a different construction. Now it is perfectly true that the idea of magical powers (*ri*ddhi) which enable saints to walk through the air, &c., occurs in the Dhammapada, see [v. 175] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1015.htm#pp_175), note. But the Dhammapada may contain earlier and later verses, and in that case our verse might be an early protest on the part of Buddha against the belief in such miraculous powers. We know how Buddha himself protested against his disciples being called upon to perform vulgar miracles. 'I command my disciples not to work miracles,' he said, 'but to hide their good deeds, and to show their sins' (Burnouf, Introd. p. 170). It would be in harmony with this sentiment if we translated our verse as I have done. As to bahira, I should take it in the sense of 'external,' as opposed to adhyâtmika, or 'internal;' and the meaning would be, 'a Sama*n*a is not a Sama*n*a by outward acts, but by his heart.' D'Alwis translates (p. 85): 'There is no footprint in the air; there is not a Sama*n*a out of the pale of the Buddhist community.'

Prapa*ñk*a, which I have here translated by 'vanity,' seems to include the whole host of human weaknesses; cf. [v. 196] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1016.htm#pp_196), where it is explained by ta*m*hâdi*tth*imânapapa*ñk*a; in our verse by ta*m*hâdisu papa*ñk*esu: cf. Lalita-vistara, p. 564, anâlaya*m* nishprapa*ñk*am anutpâdam asambhavam (dharma*k*akram). As to Tathâgata, a name of Buddha, cf. Burnouf, Introd. p. 75.

> 255. There is no path through the air, a man is not a Sama*n*a by outward acts. No creatures are eternal; but the awakened (Buddha) are never shaken. [pg 64]

**CHAPTER XIX**

THE JUST.

> 256., 257. A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no, he who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and leads others, not by violence, but by law and equity, and who is guarded by the law and intelligent, he is called just.

> 258. A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free from hatred and fear, he is called learned.

> 259. A man is not a supporter of the law because he talks much; even if a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he is a supporter of the law, a man who never neglects the law.

[^fn_64_259]: Buddhaghosa here takes law (dhamma) in the sense of the four great truths, see note to [verse 190]    (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1016.htm#pp_190). Could dhamma*m* kâyena passati mean, 'he observes the law in his acts?' Hardly, if we compare expressions like dhamma*m* vipassato, [v. 373] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1027.htm#pp_373).

> 260. A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be ripe, but he is called 'Old-in-vain.'

> 261. He in whom there is truth, virtue, love, restraint, moderation, he who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an elder.

> 262. An envious, greedy, dishonest man does not become respectable by means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion.

> 263. He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called respectable. [pg 65]

> 264. Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood become a Sama*n*a; can a man be a Sama*n*a who is still held captive by desire and greediness?

> 265. He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called a Sama*n*a (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil.

[^fn_65_265]: This is a curious etymology, because it shows that at the time when this verse was written, the original meaning of *s*rama*n*a had been forgotten. *S*rama*n*a meant originally, in the language br the Brahmans, a man who performed hard penances, from *s*ram, 'to work hard,' &c. When it became the name of the Buddhist ascetics, the language had changed, and *s*rama*n*a was pronounced sama*n*a. Now there is another Sanskrit root, *s*am, 'to quiet,' which in Pâli becomes likewise sam, and from this root sam, 'to quiet,' and not from *s*ram, 'to tire,' did the popular etymology of the day and the writer of our verse derive the title of the Buddhist priests. The original form *s*rama*n*a became known to the Greeks as {Greek: *Sarmanai*}, that of sama*n*a as {Greek: *Samanaioi*}; the former through Megasthenes, the latter through Bardesanes, 80-60 B.C. (See Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde, II, 700.) The Chinese Shamen and the Tungusian Shamen come from the same source, though the latter has sometimes been doubted. See Schott, Über die doppelte Bedeutung des Wortes Schamane, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Berlin Academy, 1842, p. 463 seq.

> 266. A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only begs.

266-270. The etymologies here given of the ordinary titles of the followers of Buddha are entirely fanciful, and are curious only as showing how the people who spoke Pâli had lost the etymological consciousness of their language. A Bhikshu is a beggar, i.e. a Buddhist friar who bas left his family and lives entirely on alms. Muni is a sage, hence *S*âkya-muni, a name of Gautama. Muni comes from man, 'to think,' and from muni comes mauna, 'silence.' Ariya, again, is the general name of those who embrace a religious life. It meant originally 'respectable, noble.' In verse 270 it seems as if the writer wished to guard against deriving ariya from ari, 'enemy.' See note to [verse 22] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1004.htm#pp_22).

> 267. He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.
 
> 268., 269. A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e. mauna), if he is foolish [pg 66] and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.

> 270. A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures; because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called Ariya.

> 271., 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning, not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the happiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not confident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires. [pg 67]

[^fn_66_272]: See Childers, Notes, p. 7.

**CHAPTER XX**

THE WAY.

> 273. The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of truths the four words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has eyes to see.

[^fn_67_273]: The eightfold or eight-membered way is the technical term for the way by which Nirvâ*n*a is attained. (See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 519.) This very way constitutes the fourth of the Four Truths, or the four words of truth, viz. Du*h*kha, 'pain ;' Samudaya, 'origin;' Nirodha,'destruction;' Mârga, 'road.' (Lotus, p. 517.) See note to [verse 178] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1015.htm#pp_178). For another explanation of the Mârga, or 'way,' see Hardy, Eastern Monachism, p. 280.

> 274. This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of intelligence. Go on this way! Everything else is the deceit of Mâra (the tempter).

[^fn_67_274]: The last line may mean, 'this way is the confusion of Mâra,' i.e. the discomfiture of Mâra.

> 275. If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way was preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns (in the flesh).

[^fn_67_275]: The *s*alyas, 'arrows or thorns,' are the *s*oka*s*alya, 'the arrows of grief.' Buddha himself is called mahâ*s*alya-hartâ, 'the great remover of thorns.' (Lalita-vistara, p. 550; Mahâbh. XII, 5616.)

> 276. You yourself must make an effort. The Tathâgatas (Buddhas) are only preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage of Mâra.

> 277. 'All created things perish,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way to purity. [pg 68]

[^fn_67_277]: See [v. 255] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1020.htm#pp_255).

> 278. 'All created things are grief and pain,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.

[^fn_68_278]: See [v. 203] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1017.htm#pp_203).

> 279. 'All forms are unreal,' he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.

[^fn_68_279]: Dhamma is here explained, like sankhâra, as the five khandha, i.e. as what constitutes a living body.

> 280. He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak, that lazy and idle man will never find the way to knowledge.

> 281. Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the wise.

[^fn_68_281]: Cf. Beal, Catena, p. 159.

> 282. Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal knowledge is lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place himself that knowledge may grow.

[^fn_68_282]: Bhûri was rightly translated 'intelligentia' by Dr. Fausböll. Dr. Weber renders it by 'Gedeihen,' but the commentator distinctly explains it as 'vast knowledge,' and in the technical sense the word occurs after vidyâ and before medhâ, in the Lalita-vistara, p. 541.

> 283. Cut down the whole forest (of lust), not a tree only! Danger comes out of the forest (of lust). When you have cut down both the forest (of lust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest and free! [pg 69]

[^fn_68_283]: A pun, vana meaning both 'lust' and 'forest.' See some mistaken remarks on this verse in D'Alwis, Nirvâ*n*a, p. 86, and some good remarks in Childers, Notes, p. 7.

> 284. So long as the love of man towards women, even the smallest, is not destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk is to its mother.

> 285. Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand! Cherish the road of peace. Nirvâ*n*a has been shown by Sugata (Buddha).

[^fn_69_285]: Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. i. p. 183.

> 286. 'Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.

[^fn_69_286]: Antarâya, according to the commentator, *g*ivitântarâya, i.e. interitus, death. In Sanskrit, antarita is used in the sense of 'vanished' or 'perished.'

> 287. Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.

> 288. Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.

> 289. A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly clear the way that leads to Nirvâ*n*a. [pg 70]

---

**CHAPTER XXI**

MISCELLANEOUS.

> 290. If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great pleasure, let a wise man leave the small pleasure, and look to the great.

> 291. He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain pleasure for himself, he, entangled in the bonds of hatred, will never be free from hatred.

> 292. What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are always increasing.

[^fn_70_292]: Cf. Beal, Catena, p. 264.

> 293. But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body, who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what ought to be done, the desires of such watchful and wise people will come to an end.

> 294. A true Brâhma*n*a goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two valiant kings, though he has destroyed a kingdom with all its subjects.

[^fn_70_294_295]: These two verses are either meant to show that a truly holy man who, by accident, commits all these crimes is guiltless, or they refer to some particular event in Buddha's history. The commentator is so startled that he explains them allegorically. Mr. D'Alwis is very indignant that I should have supposed Buddha capable of pardoning patricide. 'Can it be believed,' he writes, 'that a Teacher, who held life, even the life of the minutest insect, nay, even a living tree, in such high estimation as to prevent its wanton destruction, has declared that the murder of a Brâhma*n*a, to whom he accorded reverence, along with his own Sangha, was blameless?' D'Alwis, Nirvâ*n*a, p. 88. Though something might be said in reply, considering the antecedents of king A*g*âta*s*atru, the patron of Buddha, and stories such as that quoted by the commentator on the Dhammapada (Beal, l.c. p. 150), or in Der Weise und der Thor, p. 306, still these two verses are startling, and I am not aware that Buddha has himself drawn the conclusion, which has been drawn by others, viz. that those who have reached the highest Sambodhi, and are in fact no longer themselves, are outside the domain of good and bad, and beyond the reach of guilt. Verses like [39](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_39) and [412](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1028.htm#pp_412) admit of a different explanation. Still our verses being miscellaneous extracts, might possibly have been taken from a work in which such an opinion was advanced, and I find that Mr. Childers, no mean admirer of Buddha, was not shocked by my explanation. 'In my judgment,' he says, 'this verse is intended to express in a forcible manner the Buddhist doctrine that the Arhat cannot commit a serious sin.' However, we have met before wilh far-fetched puns in these verses, and it is not impossible that the native commentators were right after all in seeing some puns or riddles in this verse. D'Alwis, following the commentary, explains mother as lust, father as pride, the two valiant klngs as heretical systems, and the realm as sensual pleasure, while veyyaggha is taken by him for a place infested wilh the tigers of obstruction against final beatitude. Some confirmation of this interpretation is supplied by a passage in the third book of the Lankâvatâra-sûtra, as quoted by Mr. Beal in his translation of the Dhammapada, Introduction, p. 5. Here a stanza is quoted as having been recited by Buddha, in explanation of a similar startling utterance which he had made to Mahâmati:  

> 'Lust, or carnal desire, this is the Mother,  
> Ignorance, this is the Father,  
> The highest point of knowledge, this is Buddha,  
> All the kle*s*as, these are the Rahats,  
> The five skandhas, these are the Priests;  
> To commit the five unpardonable sins  
> Is to destroy these five  
> And yet not suffer the pains of hell.'  
    
The Lankâvatâra-sûtra was translated into Chinese by Bodhiru*k*i (508-511); when it was written is doubtful. See also *G*âtaka, vol. ii. p. 263.

> 295. A true Brâhma*n*a goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides. [pg 71]

> 296. The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha.

> 297. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on the law.

> 298. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on the church.

> 299. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on their body. [pg 72]

> 300. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights in compassion.

> 301. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights in meditation.

> 302. It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses; painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common), and the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.

[^fn_72_302]: This verse is difficult, and I give my translation as tentative only. Childers (Notes, p. 11) does not remove the difficulties, and I have been chiefly guided by the interpretation put on the verse by the Chinese translator; Beal, Dhammapada, p. 137.

> 303. Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated, and wealthy man chooses, there he is respected.

> 304. Good people shine from afar, like the snowy [pg 73] mountains; bad people are not seen, like arrows shot by night.

> 305. He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty of sitting alone and sleeping alone, he, subduing himself, will rejoice in the destruction of all desires alone, as if living in a forest. [pg 74]

---

**CHAPTER XXII**

THE DOWNWARD COURSE.

> 306. He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men with evil deeds in the next world.

[^fn_74_306]: I translate niraya, 'the exit, the downward course, the evil path,' by 'hell,' because the meaning assigned to that ancient mythological name by Christian writers comes so near to the Buddhist idea of niraya, that it is difficult not to believe in some actual contact between these two streams of thought. See also Mahâbh. XII, 7176. Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. ii. p. 416; [Suttanipâta, v. 660](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1035.htm#pp_660).

> 307. Many men whose shoulders are covered with the yellow gown are ill-conditioned and unrestrained; such evil-doers by their evil deeds go to hell.

307, 308. These two verses are said to be taken frorn the Vinaya-pi*t*aka I, 4, 1; D'Alwis, Nirvâ*n*a; p. 29.

> 308. Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball, like flaring fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on the charity of the land.

[^fn_74_308]: The charity of the land, i.e. the alms given, from a sense of religious duty, to every mendicant that asks for it.

> 309. Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets his neighbour's wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and lastly, hell. [pg 75]

309, 310. The four things rnentioned in verse 309 seem to be repeated in verse 310. Therefore, apu*ññ*alâbha, 'bad fame,' is the same in both: gati pâpikâ must be niraya; da*nd*a must be nindâ, and râtî thokikâ explains the anikâmaseyya*m*. Buddhaghosa takes the same view of the meaning of anikâmaseyya, i.e. yathâ i*kkh*ati eva*m* seyyam alabhitvâ, ani*kkh*ita*m* parittakam eva kâla*m* seyya*m* labhati, 'not obtaining the rest as he wishes it, he obtains it, as he does not wish it, for a short time only.'

> 310. There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to hell), there is the short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened, and the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man think of his neighbour's wife.

> 311. As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised asceticism leads to hell.

> 312. An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience to discipline, all this brings no great reward.

> 313. If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions more widely.

[^fn_75_313]: As to ra*g*a meaning 'dust' and 'passion,' see Buddhaghosha's Parables, pp. 65, 66.

> 314. An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents of it afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done it, one does not repent.

> 315. Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences within and without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should escape, for they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain when they are in hell.

> 316. They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be ashamed of, and are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of, such men, embracing false doctrines enter the evil path.

> 317. They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear not when they ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path. [pg 76]

> 318. They who forbid when there is nothing to be forbidden, and forbid not when there is something to be forbidden, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path.

> 319. They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and what is not forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter the good path. [pg 77]

**CHAPTER XXIII**

THE ELEPHANT.

> 320. Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in battle endures the arrow sent from the bow: for the world is ill-natured.

[^fn_77_320]: The elephant is with the Buddhists the emblem of endurance and self-restraint. Thus Buddha himseIf is called Nâga, 'the Elephant' (Lal. Vist. p. 553), or Mahânâga, 'the great Elephant' (Lal. Vist. p. 553), and in one passage (Lal. Vist. p. 554) the reason of this name is given, by stating that Buddha was sudânta, 'well-tamed,' like an elephant. He descended from heaven in the form of an elephant to be born on earth.
Cf. Manu VI, 47, ativâdâ*m*s titiksheta.

> 321. They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures abuse.

> 322. Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still.

> 323. For with these animals does no man reach the untrodden country (Nirvâ*n*a), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal, viz. on his own well-tamed self.

[^fn_77_323]: I read, as suggested by Dr. Fausböll, yath' attanâ sudantena danto dantena ga*kkh*ati' (cf. [verse 160]   (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1014.htm#pp_160)). The India Office MS. reads na hi etehi *th*ânehi ga*kkh*eya agata*m* disam, yath' attâna*m* sudantena danto dantena ga*kkh*ati. As to *th*ânehi instead of yânehi, see [verse 224]    (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1019.htm#pp_224).

> 324. The elephant called Dhanapâlaka, his temples running with sap, and difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound; the elephant longs for the elephant grove. [pg 78]

> 325. If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is sleepy and rolls himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on wash, is born again and again.

> 326. This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as the rider who holds the hook holds in the furious elephant.

[^fn_78_326]: Yoniso, i.e. yoni*s*a*h*, is rendered by Dr. Fausböll 'sapientiâ,' and this is the meaning ascribed to yoni by many Buddhist authorities. But the reference to Hema*k*andra (ed. Boehtlingk and Rieu, p. 281) shows clearly that it meant 'origin,' or 'cause.' Yoniso occurs frequently as a mere adverb, meaning 'thoroughly, radically' (Dhammapada, p. 359), and yoniso manasikâra (Dhammapada, p. 110) means 'taking to heart' or 'minding thoroughly,' or, what is nearly the same, 'wisely.' In the Lalita-vistara, p. 41, the commentator has clearly mistaken yoni*s*a*h*, changing it to ye 'ni*s*o, and explaining it by yamni*s*am, whereas M. Foucaux has rightly translated it by 'depuis l'origine.' Professor Weber suspected in yoni*s*a*h* a double entendre, but even grammar would show that our author is innocent of it. In Lalita-vistara, p. 544, l. 4, ayoni*s*a occurs in the sense of error.

> 327. Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.

> 328. If a man find a prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all dangers, happy, but considerate.

328, 329. Cf. [Suttanipâta, vv. 44, 45] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1033.htm#pp_44).

> 329. If a man find no prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who has left his conquered country behind,--like an elephant in the forest.

> 330. It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a fool; let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes, like an elephant in the forest. [pg 79]

> 331. If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is pleasant, whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the giving up of all grief is pleasant.

> 332. Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother, pleasant the state of a father, pleasant the state of a Sama*n*a, pleasant the state of a Brâhma*n*a.

[^fn_79_332]: The commentator throughout takes these words, like matteyyatâ, &c., to signify, not the status of a mother, or maternity, but reverence shown to a mother.

> 333. Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is a faith firmly rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant is avoiding of sins. [pg 80]

**CHAPTER XXIV**

THIRST.

> 334. The thirst of a thoughtless man grows like a creeper; he runs from life to life, like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.

[^fn_80_334]: This is explained by a story in the Chinese translation. Beal, Dhammapada, p. 148.

> 335. Whomsoever this fierce thirst overcomes, full of poison, in this world, his sufferings increase like the abounding Bîra*n*a grass.

[^fn_80_335]: Bîra*n*a grass is the Andropogon muricatum, and the scented root of it is called U*s*îra (cf. verse 337).

> 336. He who overcomes this fierce thirst, difficult to be conquered in this world, sufferings fall off from him, like water-drops from a lotus leaf.

> 337. This salutary word I tell you, 'Do ye, as many as are here assembled, dig up the root of thirst, as he who wants the sweet-scented U*s*îra root must dig up the Bîra*n*a grass, that Mâra (the tempter) may not crush you again and again, as the stream crushes the reeds.'

> 338. As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is firm so long as its root is safe, and grows again, thus, unless the feeders of thirst are destroyed, the pain (of life) will return again and again.

[^fn_80_338]: On Anusaya, i.e. Anu*s*aya (Anlage), see Wassiljew, Der Buddhismus, p. 240 seq.

> 339. He whose thirst running towards pleasure is exceeding strong in the thirty-six channels, the [pg 81] waves will carry away that misguided man, viz. his desires which are set on passion.

[^fn_80_339]: The thirty-six channels, or passions, which are divided by the commentator into eighteen external and eighteen internal, are explained by Burnouf (Lotus, p. 649), from a gloss of the *G*ina-alankâra 'L'indication précise des affections dont un Buddha acte indépendant,affections qui sont au nombre de dix-huit, nous est fourni par la glose d'un livre appartenant aux Buddhistes de Ceylan,' &c. Subhûti gives the right reading as manâpassavanâ; cf. Childers, Notes, p. 12.
Vâhâ, which Dr. Fausböll translates by 'equi,' may be vahâ, 'undae.' Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 1034] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1037.htm#pp_1034).

> 340. The channels run everywhere, the creeper (of passion) stands sprouting; if you see the creeper springing up, cut its root by means of knowledge.

> 341. A creature's pleasures are extravagant and luxurious; sunk in lust and looking for pleasure, men undergo (again and again) birth and decay.

> 342. Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare; held in fetters and bonds, they undergo pain for a long time, again and again.

> 343. Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared hare; let therefore the mendicant drive out thirst, by striving after passionlessness for himself.

> 344. He who having got rid of the forest (of lust) (i.e. after having reached Nirvâ*n*a) gives himself over to forest-life (i.e. to lust), and who, when removed from the forest (i.e. from lust), runs to the forest (i.e. to lust), look at that man! though free, he runs into bondage. [pg 82]

[^fn_81_344]: This verse seems again full of puns, all connected with the twofold meaning of vana, 'forest and lust.' By replacing 'forest' by 'lust,' we may translate: 'He who, when free from lust, gives himself up to lust, who, when removed from lust runs into lust, look at that man,' &c. Nibbana, 'though with a short a, may be intended to remind the hearer of Nibbâna. The right reading is nibbanatho; see Childers, Notes, p. 8.

> 345. Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which is made of iron, wood, or hemp; far stronger is the care for precious stones and rings, for sons and a wife.

[^fn_82_345]: Apekhâ, apekshâ, 'care;' see Manu VI, 41, 49; [Suttanipâta, v. 37] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_37); and *G*âtaka, vol. ii. p. 140.

> 346. That fetter wise people call strong which drags down, yields, but is difficult to undo; after having cut this at last, people leave the world, free from cares, and leaving desires and pleasures behind.

[^fn_82_346]: Paribba*g*, i.e. parivra*g* ; see Manu VI, 41.

> 347. Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself; when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from cares, leaving all affection behind.

[^fn_82_347]: The commentator explains the simile of the spider as follows: 'As a spider, after having made its thread-web, sits in the middle, and after killing with a violent rush a butterfly or a fly which has fallen in its circle, drinks its juice, returns, and sits again in the same place, in the same manner creatures who are given to passions, depraved by hatred, and maddened by wrath, run along the stream of thirst which they have made themselves, and cannot cross it,' &c.

> 348. Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.

> 349. If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong passions, and yearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will grow more and more, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.

> 350. If a man delights in quieting doubts, and, always reflecting, dwells on what is not delightful [pg 83] (the impurity of the body, &c.), he certainly will remove, nay, he will cut the fetter of Mâra.

> 351. He who has reached the consummation, who does not tremble, who is without thirst and without sin, he has broken all the thorns of life: this will be his last body.

> 352. He who is without thirst and without affection, who understands the words and their interpretation, who knows the order of letters (those which are before and which are after), he has received his last body, he is called the great sage, the great man.

[^fn_83_352]: As to nirutti, and its technical meaning among the Buddhists, see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 841. Fausböll translates 'niruttis vocabulorum peritus,' which may be right, if we take nirutti in the sense of the language of the Scriptures. See note to [verse 363](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1027.htm#pp_363). Could not sannipâta mean sa*m*hitâ or sannikarsha? Sannipâta occurs in the *S*âkala-prâti*s*âkhya, but with a different meaning.

> 353. 'I have conquered all, I know all, in all conditions of life I am free from taint; I have left all, and through the destruction of thirst I am free; having learnt myself, whom shall I teach?'

[^fn_83_353]: Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 210] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1018.htm#pp_210).

> 354. The gift of the law exceeds all gifts; the sweetness of the law exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the law exceeds all delights; the extinction of thirst overcomes all pain.

[^fn_83_354]: The dhammadâna, or 'gift of the law,' is the technical term for instruction in the Buddhist religion. See Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 160, where the story of the Sakkadevarâ*g*a is told, and where a free rendering of our verse is given.

> 355. Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for the other shore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys himself, as if he were his own enemy. [pg 84]

> 356. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by passion: therefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings great reward.

> 357. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by hatred: therefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate brings great reward.

> 358. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by vanity: therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from vanity brings great reward.

> 359. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust: therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from lust brings great reward. [pg 85]

**CHAPTER XXV**

THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT).

> 360. Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the tongue.

> 361. In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu, restrained in all things, is freed from all pain.

> 362. He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls his speech, he who is well controlled, he who delights inwardly, who is collected, who is solitary and content, him they call Bhikshu.

> 363. The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and calmly, who teaches the meaning and the law, his word is sweet.

[^fn_85_363]: On artha and dharma, see Stanislas Julien, Les Avadânas, I, 217, note; 'Les quatre connaissances sont; 1&deg; la connaissance du sens (artha); 2&deg; la connaissance de la Loi (dharma); 3&deg; la connaissance des explications (niroukti); 4&deg; la connaissance de l'intelligence (prâtibhâna).'

> 364. He who dwells in the law, delights in the law, meditates on the law, follows the law, that Bhikshu will never fall away from the true law.

[^fn_85_364]: The expression dhammârâmo, 'having his garden or delight (Lustgarten) in the law,' is well matched by the Brahmanic expression ekârâma, i.e. nirdvandva (Mahâbh. XIII, 1930). Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 326] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1034.htm#pp_326); [Dhammapada, v. 32] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1004.htm#pp_32).

> 365. Let him not despise what he has received, [pg 86] nor ever envy others: a mendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.

> 366. A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he has received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if he is not slothful.

> 367. He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.

[^fn_86_367]: Nâmarûpa is here used again in its technical sense of mind and body, neither of which, however, is with the Buddhists âtman, or 'self.' Asat, 'what is not,' may therefore mean the same as nâmarûpa, or we may take it in the sense of what is no more, as, for instance, the beauty or youth of the body, the vigour of the mind, &c.

> 368. The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirvâ*n*a), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.

[^fn_86_368]: See Childers, Notes, p. 11.

> 369. O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go quickly; having cut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to Nirvâ*n*a.

> 370. Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A Bhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called Oghati*nn*a, 'saved from the flood.'

> 371. Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy thought to what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to swallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when burning, 'This is pain.' [pg 87]

[^fn_86_371]: The swallowing of hot iron balls is considered as a punishment in hell; see [verse 308]   (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1024.htm#pp_308). Professor Weber has perceived the right meaning of bhavassu, which can only be bhâvayasva, but I doubt whether the rest of his rendering is right, for who would swallow an iron ball by accident?

> 372. Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto Nirvâ*n*a.

[^fn_87_372]: Cf. Beal, Catena, p. 247.

> 373. A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the law clearly.

> 374. As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong to those who know the immortal (Nirvâ*n*a).

> 375. And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.

[^fn_87_375]: Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 337] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1034.htm#pp_337).

> 376. Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in the fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.

> 377. As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed passion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!

> 378. The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called quiet.

> 379. Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!

> 380. For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse. [pg 88]

> 381. The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha will reach the quiet place (Nirvâ*n*a), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.

[^fn_88_381]: See [verse 368] (#pp_368). D'Alwis translates, 'dissolution of the sankhâras (elements of existence).'

> 382. He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds. [pg 89]

---

**CHAPTER XXVI**

THE BRÂHMA*N*A (ARHAT).

> 383. Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires, O Brâhma*n*a! When you have understood the destruction of all that was made, you will understand that which was not made.

> 384. If the Brâhma*n*a has reached the other shore in both laws (in restraint and contemplation), all bonds vanish from him who has obtained knowledge.

> 385. He for whom there is neither this nor that shore, nor both, him, the fearless and unshackled, I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a.

[^fn_89_385]: The exact meaning of the two shores is not quite clear, and the commentator who takes them in the sense of internal and external organs of sense can hardly be right. See [verse 86] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1008.htm#pp_86).

> 386. He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without passions, and who has attained the highest end, him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a.

> 387. The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior is bright in his armour, the Brâhma*n*a is bright in his meditation; but Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.

> 388. Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brâhma*n*a; because he walks quietly, therefore he is called Sama*n*a; because he has sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called Pravra*g*ita (Pabba*g*ita, a pilgrim). [pg 90]

[^fn_89_388]: These would-be etytmologies are again interesting as showing the decline of the etymlological life of the spoken language of India at the time when such etymologies became possible. In order to derive Brâhma*n*a from vâh, it must have been pronounced bâhma*n*o; vâh, 'to remove,' occurs frequently in the Buddhistical Sanskrit. Cf. Lal. Vist. p. 551, l. 1; 553, l. 7. See note to [verse 265](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1021.htm#pp_265).

> 389. No one should attack a Brâhma*n*a, but no Brâhma*n*a (if attacked) should let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a Brâhma*n*a, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!

> 390. It advantages a Brâhma*n*a not a little if he holds his mind back from the pleasures of life; when all wish to injure has vanished, pain will cease.

[^fn_90_390]: I am afraid I have taken too much liberty with this verse. Dr. Fausböll translates, 'Non Brâhma*n*ae hoc paulo melius, quando retentio fit mentis a jucundis.'

> 391. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who does not offend by body, word, or thought, and is controlled on these three points.

> 392. After a man has once understood the law as taught by the Well-awakened (Buddha), let him worship it carefully, as the Brâhma*n*a worships the sacrificial fire.

> 393. A man does not become a Brâhma*n*a by his platted hair, by his family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is blessed, he is a Brâhma*n*a.

[^fn_90_393]: Fausböll proposes to read *g*a*kk*â (*g*âtyâ). 'Both' in the first edition of my translation was a misprint for 'birth.'

> 394. What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest clean.

[^fn_90_394]: I have not copied the language of the Bible more than I was justified in. The words are abbhantaran te gahana*m*, bâhira*m* parima*gg*asi, 'interna est abyssus, externum mundas.' Cf. *G*âtaka, vol. i. p. 481.

> 395. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is [pg 91] emaciated and covered with veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a.

[^fn_90_395]: The expression Kisan dhamanisanthatam is the Sanskrit k*ri*sa*m* dhamanîsantatam, the frequent occurrence of which in the Mahâbhârata has been pointed out by Boehtlingk, s.v. dhamani. It looks more like a Brâhmanic than like a Buddhist phrase.

> 396. I do not call a man a Brâhma*n*a because of his origin or of his mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a.

[^fn_91_396]: From verse 396 to the first half of verse 423, the text of the Dhammapada agrees with the text of the Vasish*th*a-Bharadvâ*g*asûtra. These verses are translated by D'Alwis in his Nirvâ*n*a, pp. 113-118, and again by Fausböll, Suttanipâta, [v. 620 seq] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1035.htm#pp_620).
The text contains puns on ki*ñk*ana, which means 'wealth,' but also 'attachment;' cf. Childers, s.v.

> 397. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who has cut all fetters, who never trembles, is independent and unshackled.

> 398. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who has cut the strap and the thong, the chain with all that pertains to it, who has burst the bar, and is awakened.

[^fn_91_398]: D'Alwis points out a double entendre in these words. Nandhi may be either the strap that goes round a drum, or enmity; varatta may be either a thong or attachment; sandâna either chain or scepticism; sabanakkamam either due order or all its concomitants; paligha either bar or ignorance.

> 399. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who, though he has committed no offence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes, who has endurance for his force, and strength for his army.

[^fn_91_399]: The exact meaning of balânîka is difficult to find. Does it mean, possessed of a strong army, or facing a force, or leading a force?

> 400. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who is free from anger, dutiful, virtuous, without appetite, who is subdued, and has received his last body. [pg 92]

> 401. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who does not cling to pleasures, like water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.

> 402. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who, even here, knows the end of his suffering, has put down his burden, and is unshackled.

> 403. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a whose knowledge is deep, who possesses wisdom, who knows the right way and the wrong, and has attained the highest end.

> 404. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who keeps aloof both from laymen and from mendicants, who frequents no houses, and has but few desires.

> 405. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who finds no fault with other beings, whether feeble or strong, and does not kill nor cause slaughter.

[^fn_92_405]: On tasa and thâvara, see Childers, s.v., and D'Alwis, Nirvâ*n*a, p. 115. On da*nd*a, 'the rod,' see Hibbert Lectures, p. 355, note.

> 406. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who is tolerant with the intolerant, mild with fault-finders, and free from passion among the passionate.

> 407. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a from whom anger and hatred, pride and envy have dropt like a mustard seed from the point of a needle.

> 408. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who utters true speech, instructive and free from harshness, so that he offend no one.

> 409. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who takes nothing in the world that is not given him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.

> 410. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who fosters no desires for this world or for the next, has no inclinations, and is unshackled. [pg 93]

> 411. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who has no interests, and when he has understood (the truth), does not say How, how? and who has reached the depth of the Immortal.

[^fn_93_411]: Akathankathi is explained by Buddhaghosa as meaning, 'free from doubt or hesitation.' He also uses kathankathâ in the sense of 'doubt' (verse 414). ln the Kâvyâdar*s*a, III, 17, the commentator explains akatham by kathârahitam, nirvivâdam, which would mean, 'without a kathâ, a speech, a story without contradiction, unconditionally.' From our passage, however, it seems as if kathankathâ was a noun derived from kathankathayati, 'to say How, how?' so that neither the first nor the second element had anything to do with kath, 'to relate;' and in that case akatham, too, ought to be taken in the sense of 'without a Why.'

> 412. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who in this world is above good and evil, above the bondage of both, free from grief from sin, and from impurity.

[^fn_93_412]: See [verse 39] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1005.htm#pp_39). The distinction between good and evil vanishes when a man has retired from the world, and has ceased to act, longing only for deliverance.

> 413. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who is bright like the moon, pure, serene, undisturbed, and in whom all gaiety is extinct.

> 414. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who has traversed this miry road; the impassable world and its vanity, who has gone through, and reached the other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free from doubts, free from attachment, and content.

> 415. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who in this world, leaving all desires, travels about without a home, and in whom all concupiscence is extinct.

> 416. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who, leaving all longings, travels about without a home, and in whom all covetousness is extinct.

> 417. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who, after leaving all bondage to men, has risen above all [94] bondage to the gods, and is free from all and every bondage.

> 418. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who has left what gives pleasure and what gives pain, who is cold, and free from all germs (of renewed life), the hero who has conquered all the worlds.

[^fn_94_418]: Upadhi, if not used in a technical sense, is best translated by 'passions or affections.' Technically there are four upadhis or substrata, viz. the kandhas, kâma, 'desire,' kilesa, 'sin,' and kamma, 'work.' The Brâhmana may be called nirupadhi, as being free from desire, misery, and work and its consequences, but not yet of the kandhas, which end through death only. The commentator explains nirupadhi by nirupakkilesa, 'free from sin.' See Childers, s.v. nibbâna, p. 268 a.

> 419. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who knows the destruction and the return of beings everywhere, who is free from bondage, welfaring (Sugata), and awakened (Buddha). [pg 95]

[^fn_94_419]: Sugata is one of those many words in Buddhist literature which it is almost impossible to translate, because they have been taken in so many acceptations by the Buddhists themselves. Sugata etymologically means 'one who has fared well,' sugati means 'happiness and blessedness.' It is wrong to translate it literally by 'welcome,' for that in Sanskrit is svâgata; and we cannot accept Dr. Eitel's staternent (Handbook, p. 138) that sugata stands incorrectly for svâgata. Sugata is one of the not very numerous technical terms in Buddhism for which hitherto we know of no antecedents in earlier Brahmanism. It may have been used in the sense of 'happy and blessed,' but it never became a title, while in Buddhism it has become, not only a title, but almost a proper name of Buddha. The same applies to tathâgata, lit. 'thus come,' but used in Sanskrit very much like tathâvidha, in the sense of talis, while in Buddhism it means a Buddha. There are of course many interpretations of the word, and many reasons are given why Buddhas should be called Tathâgata (Burnouf, Introduction, p. 75, &c.) Boehtlingk s.v. supposed that, because Buddha had so many predicates, he was, for the sake of brevity, called 'such a one as he really is.' I think we may go a step further. Another word, tâd*ris*a, meaning talis, becomes in Pâli, under the form of tâdi, a name of Buddha's disciples, and afterwards of Buddha himself. If applied to Buddha's disciples, it may have meant originally 'such as he,' i.e. his fellows; but when applied to Buddha himself, it can only mean 'such a one,' i.e. 'so great a man.' The Sanskrit mârsha is probably the Pâli mâriso, which stands for mâdiso, Sk. mâd*ris*a, 'like me,' used in Pâli when a superior addresses others as his equals, and afterwards changed into a mere title of respect.

> 420. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a whose path the gods do not know, nor spirits (Gandharvas), nor men, whose passions are extinct, and who is an Arhat (venerable).

> 421. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who calls nothing his own, whether it be before, behind, or between, who is poor, and free from the love of the world.

> 422. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a, the manly, the noble, the hero, the great sage, the conqueror, the impassible, the accomplished, the awakened.

> 423. Him I call indeed a Brâhma*n*a who knows his former abodes, who sees heaven and hell, has reached the end of births, is perfect in knowledge, a sage, and whose perfections are all perfect.
