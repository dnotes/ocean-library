description: >-
  The Heart Sutra is probably the most widely used Mahayana Buddhist text. The
  earliest dated inscription of the Sutra is a Chinese translation by Xuanzang,
  from a stone tablet dated 661 C.E. The tablet exists in two versions, a long
  version and a short version, with the long version containing additional
  introductory and closing paragraphs, which are common features in Buddhist
  sutras. The short version is used in most East Asian Buddhist traditions,
  while the long version is still used in Tibetan Buddhism. 

  This translation is a modern interpretive translation by Thich Nhat Hanh.
  "Prajñā Pāramitā" from the Sanskrit, often translated as "Perfection of
  Wisdom," is here rendered as "the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore."
  The last three lines, "gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, svaha!"
  constitute a mantra often used in Buddhist chanting, which can be translated
  as "gone, gone, everyone gone to the other shore, awakening, svaha!"

# The Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore

Avalokiteshvara
while practicing deeply with
the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore,
suddenly discovered that
all of the five Skandhas are equally empty,
and with this realisation
he overcame all Ill-being. {.verse}

“Listen Sariputra,
this Body itself is Emptiness
and Emptiness itself is this Body.
This Body is not other than Emptiness
and Emptiness is not other than this Body.
The same is true of Feelings,
Perceptions, Mental Formations,
and Consciousness. {.verse}

“Listen Sariputra,
all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness;
their true nature is the nature of
no Birth no Death,
no Being no Non-being,
no Defilement no Purity,
no Increasing no Decreasing. {.verse}

“That is why in Emptiness,
Body, Feelings, Perceptions,
Mental Formations and Consciousness
are not separate self entities. {.verse}

The Eighteen Realms of Phenomena
which are the six Sense Organs,
the six Sense Objects,
and the six Consciousnesses
are also not separate self entities. {.verse}

The Twelve Links of Interdependent Arising
and their Extinction
are also not separate self entities.
Ill-being, the Causes of Ill-being,
the End of Ill-being, the Path,
insight and attainment,
are also not separate self entities. {.verse}

Whoever can see this
no longer needs anything to attain. {.verse}

Bodhisattvas who practice
the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore
see no more obstacles in their mind,
and because there
are no more obstacles in their mind,
they can overcome all fear,
destroy all wrong perceptions
and realize Perfect Nirvana. {.verse}

“All Buddhas in the past, present and future
by practicing
the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore
are all capable of attaining
Authentic and Perfect Enlightenment. {.verse}

“Therefore Sariputra,
it should be known that
the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore
is a Great Mantra,
the most illuminating mantra,
the highest mantra,
a mantra beyond compare,
the True Wisdom that has the power
to put an end to all kinds of suffering.
Therefore let us proclaim
a mantra to praise
the Insight that Brings Us to the Other Shore. {.verse}

*Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!*
*Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!*
*Gate, Gate, Paragate, Parasamgate, Bodhi Svaha!*” {.verse}
