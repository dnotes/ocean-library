  The Forty Ḥadít_h of Nawawí is the most well-known example of the "arbaʿíniyyát" (Forty Hadith) genre of Ḥadít_h literature. It was compiled by the Imam Nawawí (1234–1277 C.E.), an eminent scholar in the field of Islamic jurisprudence, as a distillation of the principles that form the foundation of Islamic Sharí‘ah law. This translation, of unknown provenance, was found on 40hadith.com; the subject headings for the ḥadít_h were taken from 40hadithnawawi.com.

## Ḥadít_h 1

On the authority of Omar bin Al-Khattab, who said: I heared the messenger of Alláh *salla Alláh u alihi wa sallam* say:

"Actions are but by intention and every man shall have but that which he intended. Thus he whose migration was for Alláh and His messenger, his migration was for Alláh and His messenger, and he whose migration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his migration was for that for which he migrated."

## Ḥadít_h 2

Also on the authority of Omar, who said: One day while we were sitting with the messenger of Alláh there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of journeying were to be seen on him and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the prophet. Resting his knees against his and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs, he said: "O Muḥammad, tell me about Islam." The messenger of Alláh said: "Islam is to testify that there is no god but Alláh and Muḥammad is the messenger of Alláh, to perform the prayers, to pay the zakat, to fast in Ramaḍán, and to make the pilgrimage to the House if you are able to do so." He said: "You have spoken rightly," and we were amazed at him asking him and saying that he had spoken rightly. He said: "Then tell me about *eman*." He said: "It is to believe in Alláh, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day, and to believe in divine destiny, both the good and the evil thereof." He said: "You have spoken rightly." He said: "Then tell me about *ehsan*." He said: "It is to worship Alláh as though you are seeing Him, and while you see Him not yet truly He sees you." He said: "Then tell me about the Hour." He said: "The one questioned about it knows no better than the questioner." He said: "Then tell me about its signs." He said: "That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute herdsman competing in constructing lofty buildings." Then he took himself off and I stayed for a time. Then he said: "O Omar, do you know who the questioner was?" I said: "Alláh and His messenger know best". He said: "He was Jebreel (Gabriel), who came to you to teach you your religion."

narrated by Muslim {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 3

On the authority of Ibn Omar, the son of Omar bin Al-Khattab, may Alláh be pleased with both, who said: I heared the messenger of Alláh say:

"Islam has been built on five \[pillars\]: testifying that there is no god but Alláh and that Muḥammad is the messenger of Alláh, performing the prayers, paying the zakat, making the pilgrimage to the House, and fasting in Ramaḍán."

related by Bukhari and Muslim {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 4

On the authority of ‘Abdu’lláh bin Masud, who said: the messenger of Alláh, and he is the truthful, the believed narrated to us:

"Verily the creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother's belly for forty days in the form of seed, then he is a clot of blood for a like period, then a morsel of flesh for a like period, then there is sent to him the angel who blows the breath of life into him and who is commanded about four matters: to write down his means of livelihood, his life span, his actions, and whether happy or unhappy. By Alláh, other than Whom there is no god, verily one of you behaves like the people of Paradise until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has been written over takes him and so he behaves like the people of Hell-fire and thus he enters it; and one of you behaves like the people of Hell-fire until there is but an arm's length between him and it, and that which has been written over takes him and so he behaves like the people of Paradise and thus he enters it."

## Ḥadít_h 6

On the authority of Al-Numan bin Bas_hír, who said: I heared the messenger of Alláh say:

"That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain and between the two of them are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Alláh's sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it be whole, all the body is whole and which, if it be diseased, all of it is diseased. Truly it is the heart."

narrated by Bukhari and Muslim {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 7

‘Abdu’lláh bin Omar narrated that the messenger of Alláh said:

## Ḥadít_h 9

On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: I heared the messenger of Alláh say:

related by Bukhari and Muslim {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 10

On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: the messenger of Alláh said:

"Alláh the Almighty is good and accepts only that which is good. Alláh has commanded the faithful to do that which he commanded the messengers, and the Almighty has said: "O ye messengers! Eat of the good things and do right." And Alláh the Almighty has said: "O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you" Then he mentioned \[the case of\] a man who, having journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his hands to the sky \[saying\]: "O Lord! O Lord!" - while his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful, his clothing unlawful, and he is nourished unlawfully, so how can he be answered!"

it was related by Bukhari and Muslim {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 15

On the authority of ‘Abdu’lláh bin ‘Abbás, who said: One day I was behind the prophet and he said to me: "Young man, I shall teach you some words \[of advice\]: Be mindful of Alláh, and Alláh will protect you. Be mindful of Alláh, and you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, ask of Alláh; if you seek help, seek help of Alláh. Know that if the Nation were to gather together to benefit you with anything, it would benefit you only with something that Alláh had already prescribed for you, and that if they gather together to harm you with anything, they would harm you only with something Alláh had already prescribed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried."

narrated by Termithi, who said it is true and fine hadith {.italic}

In a version other than that of Tirmithi it reads: {.italic}

"...Be mindful of Alláh, you will find Him before you. Get to know Alláh in prosperity and He will know you in adversity.

## Ḥadít_h 22

On the authority of Abu Malik Al-Harith bin Asim Al-Ashari said that the messenger of Alláh said:

"Purity is half of faith. *alhamdu-lillah* \[Praise be to Alláh\] fills the scales, and *subhana-Alláh* \[How far is Alláh from every imperfection\] and *alhamdu-lillah* \[Praise be to Alláh\] fill that which is between heaven and earth. Prayer is light; charity is a proof; patience is illumination; and the Qur’án is an argument for or against you. Everyone starts his day and is a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or bringing about its ruin."

related by Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 23

On the authority of Abu Dharr Al-Ghafari, of the prophet is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord is that He said:

"O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you. O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefiting Me so as to benefit Me. O my servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to become as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more than a needle decreases the sea if put into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him who finds good praise Alláh, and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself."

related by Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 24

On the authority of Abu Dharr:

Some of the companions of the messenger of Alláh said: "O Messenger of Alláh, the affluent have made of with the rewards, they pray as we pray they fast as we fast, and they give away in charity the superfluity of their wealth." He said: "Has not Alláh made things for you to give away in charity? Every tasbihah is a charity, every takbirah is a charity, every tahmidah is a charity, and every tahlilah is a charity, to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action is a charity, and in the sexual act of each of you there is a charity." They said: "O Messenger of Alláh, when one of us fulfils his sexual desire will he have some reward for that?" He said: "Do you not think that were he to act upon it unlawfully he would be sinning? Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward."

related by Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 25

On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: The messenger of Alláh said:

"Each person's every joint must perform a charity every day the sun comes up: to act justly between two people is a charity; to help a man with his mount, lifting him onto it or hoisting up his belongings onto it is a charity: a good word is a charity, every step you take to prayers is a charity and removing a harmful thing from the road is a charity."

related by Bukhari and Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 26

On the authority of Al-Nawwas bin Samaan, that the prophet said:

"Righteousness is good morality, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in your soul and which you dislike people finding out about."

related by Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 27

And on the authority of Wabisa bin Mabad, may Alláh be pleased with him, who said:

I came to the messenger of Alláh and he said: "You have come to ask about righteousness?" I said: "Yes." He said: "Consult your heart. Righteousness is that about which the soul feels tranquil and the heart feels tranquil, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in the soul and moves to and fro in the breast even though people again and again have given you their legal opinion \[in its favor\]."

a good hadith transmetted from the Musnads of the two Imams, Aḥmad bin Hanbal and Al-Darimi, with a good chain of authorities. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 28

On the authority of Abu Najih Al-Erbadh bin Sariah, who said:

The messenger of Alláh gave us a sermon by which our hearts were filled with fear and tears came to our eyes. We said: "O Messenger of Alláh, it is as though this is a farewell sermon, so councel us." He said: "I councel you to fear Alláh and to give absolute obedience even if a slave becomes your leader. Verily he among you who lives \[long\] will see great controversy, so you must keep to my sunnah and to the sunnah of the rightly-guided Khalifahs—cling to them stubbornly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray, and every going astray is in Hell-fire."

related by Abu Dawud and Al-Tirmithi, who said that it was a fine and true Ḥadít_h. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 29

On the authority of Muadh bin Jabal, who said:

I said: "O Messenger of Alláh, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will keep me away from Hell fire." He said: "You have asked me about a major matter, yet it is easy for him for whom Alláh Almighty makes it easy. You should worship Alláh, associating nothing with Him, you should perform the prayers, you should pay the zakat, you should fast in Ramaḍán, and you should make the pilgrimage to the House." Then he said: "Shall I not show you the gates of goodness? Fasting \[which\] is a shield, charity \[which\] extigueshes sin as water extebgueshes fire; and the praying of a man in the deapth of night." Then he recited: **"Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of that We have bestowed on them. No soul knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy, as a reward for what they used to do".** *(Qur’án 32:16-17)* Then he said: "Shall I not tell you of the peak of the matter, its pillar, and its topmost part?" I said: "Yes, O Messenger of Alláh." He said: "The peak of the matter is Islam; the pillar is prayer; and its topmost part is jihad." Then he said: "Shall I not tell you of the controling of all that?" I said: "Yes, O Messenger of Alláh," and he took hold of his tongue and said: "Restrain this." I said: "O Prophet of Alláh, will what we say be held against us?" He said: "May your mother be bereaved of you, Muadh! Is there anything that topples people on their faces—or he said on their noses into Hell-fire other than the jests of their tongues?"

related by Al-Tirmithi, who said it was a fine and true hadlth. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 30

On the authority of Jurthum bin Nashir that the messenger of Alláh said:

"Alláh the Almighty has laid down religious duties, so do not neglict them. He has set boundaries, so do not over step them. He has prohibited some things, so do not violate them; about some things He was silent—out of compassion for you, not forgetfulness, so seek not after them."

a fine hadith related by Al-Daraqutni and others. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 31

On the authority of Sahl bin Saad Al-Saedi, who said:

A man came to the prophet and said: "O Messenger of Alláh, direct me to an act which, if I do it, \[will cause\] Alláh to love me and people to love me." He said: "Renounce the world and Alláh will love you, and renounce what people possess and people will love you."

a fine Ḥadít_h related by Ibn Majah and others with good chains of authorities. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 32

"There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm."

a fine hadith related by Ibn Majah, Al-Daraqutni and others {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 33

On the authority of Ibn ‘Abbás that the Messenger of Alláh said:

"Were people to be given in accordance with their claim, men would claim the fortunes and lives of \[other\] people, but the onus of proof is on the claimant, and the taking of an oath is incumbent upon him who denies."

a fine hadith related by Al-Baihaqi and others {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 34

On the authority of Abu Saeed Al-Khurdari, who said: I heard the messenger of Alláh say:

"Whosoever of you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand; and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if he is not able to do so, then with his heart; and that is the weakest of faith."

related by Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 35

On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: the messenger of Alláh said:

"Do not envy one another; do not inflate prices one to another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another; and do not undercut one another, but be you, O servants of Alláh, brothers. A muslim is the brother of a muslim: he neither oppresses him nor does he fail him, he neither lies to him nor does he hold him in contempt. Piety is right here—and he pointed to his breast three times. It is evil enough for a man to hold his brother muslim in contempt. The whole of a muslim for another muslim is inviolable: his blood, his property, and his honor."

related by Muslim. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 36

On the authority of Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said:

"Whosoever removes a worldly grief from a believer, Alláh will remove from him one of the griefs of the Day of Judgment. Whosoever alleviates \[the lot of\] a needy person, Alláh will alleviate \[his lot\] in this world and the next. Whosoever shields a Muslim, Alláh will shield him in this world and the next. Alláh will aid a servant \[of His\] so long as the servant aids his brother. Whosoever follows a path to seek knowledge therein, Alláh will make easy for him a path to Paradise. No people gather together in one of the houses of Alláh, reciting the Book of Alláh and studying it among themselves, without tranquility descending upon them, mercy enveloping them, the angels surrounding them, and Alláh making mention of them amongst those who are with Him. Whosoever is slowed down by his actions will not be hastened forward by his lineage."

related by Muslim in these words. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 37

On the authority of Ibn ‘Abbás that the messenger of Alláh, among the sayings he relates from his Lord is:

"Alláh has written down the good deeds and the bad ones." Then he explained it \[by saying that\]: "He who has intended a good deed and has not done it, Alláh writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Alláh writes it down with Himself as from ten good deeds to seven hundred times, or many times over. But if he has intended a bad deed and has not done it, Alláh writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Alláh writes it down as one bad deed."

related by Bukhari and Muslim in their two salihs {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 38

On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: the messenger of Alláh said:

Alláh the Almighty has said: "Whosoever shows enmity to a friend of Mine, I shall be at war with him. My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have imposed upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask \[something\] of Me, I would surely give it to him and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it."

related by Bukhari. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 39

The son of Omar used to say: "At evening do not expect \[to live till\] morning, and at morning do not expect \[to live till\] evening. Take from your health for your illness and from your life for your death."

related by Bukhari {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 41

On the authority of Abu Muḥammad ‘Abdu’lláh bin Amr bin Al-Aas, who said: The messenger of Alláh, said:

"None of you \[truly\] believes until his inclination is accordance with what I have brought."

a fine and true hadith which we have transmitted from the book of Hujjah with a sound chain of authorities. {.italic}

## Ḥadít_h 42

On the authority of Anas, who said: I heard the messenger of Alláh say:

Alláh the Almighty has said: "O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as its."

related by Al-Tirmithi, who said that it was a good and sound Ḥadít_h. {.italic}
