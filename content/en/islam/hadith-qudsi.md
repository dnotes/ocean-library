*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 1:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said:

When Alláh decreed the Creation He pledged Himself by writing in His book which is laid down with Him: My mercy prevails over my wrath.

It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 2:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said: Alláh Almighty has said:

The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the initial creation \[of him\] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: Alláh has taken to Himself a son, while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.
 i.e., bring me back to life after death.

It was related by al-Bukhari (also by an-Nasa'i).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 3:*

On the authority of Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhaniyy (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said:

The Messenger of Alláh (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be upon him) led the morning prayer for us at al-Hudaybiyah following rainfall during the night. When the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be upon him) finished, he faced the people and said to them: Do you know what your Lord has said? They said: Alláh and his Messenger know best. He said: This morning one of my servants became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said: We have been given rain by virtue of Alláh and His mercy, that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the stars; and as for him who said: We have been given rain by such-and-such a star, that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the stars.
 The pre-Islamic Arabs believed that rain was brought about by the movement of stars. This Ḥadít_h draws attention to the fact that whatever be the direct cause of such natural phenomena as rain, it is Alláh the Almighty who is the Disposer of all things.

It is related by al-Bukhari (also by Malik and an-Nasa'i).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 4:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said: Alláh said:

Sons of Adam inveigh against \[the vicissitudes of\] Time, and I am Time, in My hand is the night and the day.
 As the Almighty is the Ordainer of all things, to inveigh aginst misfortunes that are part of Time is tantamount to inveighing against Him.

It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 5:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said: Alláh (glorified and exalted be He) said:

I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for someone else's sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.

It was related by Muslim (also by Ibn Majah).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 6:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) say:

The first of people against whom judgment will be pronounced on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who died a martyr. He will be brought and Alláh will make known to him His favours and he will recognize them. \[ The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I fought for you until I died a martyr. He will say: You have lied - you did but fight that it might be said \[of you\]: He is courageous. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire. \[Another\] will be a man who has studied \[religious\] knowledge and has taught it and who used to recite the Qur’án. He will be brought and Alláh will make known to his His favours and he will recognize them. \[The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I studied \[religious\] knowledge and I taught it and I recited the Qur’án for Your sake. He will say: You have lied - you did but study \[religious\] knowledge that it might be said \[of you\]: He is learned. And you recited the Qur’án that it might be said \[of you\]: He is a reciter. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire. \[Another\] will be a man whom Alláh had made rich and to whom He had given all kinds of wealth. He will be brought and Alláh will make known to his His favours and he will recognize them. \[The Almighty\] will say: And what did you do about them? He will say: I left no path \[untrodden\] in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. He will say: You have lied - you did but do so that it might be said \[of you\]: He is open-handed. And so it was said. Then he will be ordered to be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hell-fire.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 7:*

On the authority of Uqbah ibn Amir (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said: I heard the messenger of Alláh (PBUH) say:

Your Lord delights at a shepherd who, on the peak of a mountain crag, gives the call to prayer and prays. Then Alláh (glorified and exalted be He) say: Look at this servant of Mine, he gives the call to prayer and performs the prayers; he is in awe of Me. I have forgiven My servant \[his sins\] and have admitted him to Paradise.

It was related by an-Nasa'i with a good chain of authorities.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 8:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH), who said:

A prayer performed by someone who has not recited the Essence of the Qur’án during it is deficient (and he repeated the word three times), incomplete. Someone said to Abu Hurayrah: \[Even though\] we are behind the imam? He said: Recite it to yourself, for I have heard the Prophet (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be up on him) say: Alláh (mighty and sublime be He), had said: I have divided prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, and My servant shall have what he has asked for. When the servant says: Al-hamdu lillahi rabbi l-alamin, Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) says: My servant has praised Me. And when he says: Ar-rahmani r-rahim, Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) says: My servant has extolled Me, and when he says: Maliki yawmi d-din, Alláh says: My servant has glorified Me - and on one occasion He said: My servant has submitted to My power. And when he says: Iyyaka na budu wa iyyaka nasta in, He says: This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for. And when he says: Ihdina s-sirata l- mustaqim, siratal ladhina an amta alayhim ghayril-maghdubi alayhim wa la d-dallin, He says: This is for My servant, and My servant shall have what he has asked for.
 Surat al-Fatihah, the first surah (chapter) of the Qur’án.
 i.e. standing behind the imam (leader) listening to him reciting al-Fatihah.
 "Praise be to Alláh, Lord of the Worlds."
 "The Merciful, the Compassionate".
 "Master of the Day of Judgement".
 "It is You we worship and it is You we ask for help".
 "Guide us to the straight path, the path of those upon whom You have bestowed favors, not of those against whom You are angry, nor of those who are astray".

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 9:*

On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) says:

The fist of his actions for which a servant of Alláh will be held accountable on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayers. If they are in order, then he will have prospered and succeeded: and if they are wanting, then he will have failed and lost. If there is something defective in his obligatory prayers, the Lord (glorified and exalted be He) will say: See if My servant has any supererogatory prayers with which may be completed that which was defective in his obligatory prayers. Then the rest of his actions will be judged in like fashion.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 10:*

On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) says:

Fasting is Mine and it I who give reward for it. \[A man\] gives up his sexual passion, his food and his drink for my sake. Fasting is like a shield, and he who fasts has two joys: a joy whin he breaks his fast and a joy when he meets his Lord. The change in the breath of the mouth of him who fasts is better in Alláh's estimation than the smell of musk.

It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim, Malik, at-Tirmidhi, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 11:*

On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH), who said: Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) said:

Spend (on charity), O son of Adam, and I shall spend on you.

####

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 12:*

On the authority of Abu Mas'ud al-Ansari (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be upon him) said:

A man from among those who were before you was called to account. Nothing in the way of good was found for him except that he used to have dealings with people and, being well-to-do, he would order his servants to let off the man in straitened circumstances \[from repaying his debt\]. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said that Alláh said: We are worthier than you of that (of being so generous). Let him off.

It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari and an-Nasa'i).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 13:*

On the authority of Adiyy ibn Hatim (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said:

I was with the Messenger of Alláh (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be upon him) and there came to him two men: one of them was complaining of penury (being very poor), while the other was complaining of brigandry (robbery). The Messenger of Alláh (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be upon him) said: As for brigandry, it will be but a short time before a caravan will \[be able to\] go out of Mecca without a guard. As for penury, the Hour (Day of Judgement) will not arrive before one of you takes his charity around without finding anyone to accept it from him. Then one of you will surely stand before Alláh, there being no screed between Him and him, nor an interpreter to translate for him. Then He will say to him: Did I not bring you wealth? And he will say: Yes. Then He will say: Did I not send to you a messenger? And he will say: Yes. And he will look to his right and will see nothing but Hell-fire, then he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire, so let each of you protect himself against Hell-fire, be it with even half a date - and if he finds it not, then with a kind word.
 i.e. at the time of the Hour. It was related by al-Bukhari.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 14:*

On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH), who said:

Alláh (glorified and exalted be He) has supernumerary angels who rove about seeking out gatherings in which Alláh's name is being invoked: they sit with them and fold their wings round each other, fillin that which is between them and between the lowest heaven. When \[the people in the gathering\] depart, \[the angels\] ascend and rise up to heaven. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h.) said: Then Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) asks them - \[though\] He is most knowing about them: From where have you come? And they say: We have come from some servants of Yours on Earth: they were glorifying You (Subhana llah), exalting you (Allahu akbar), witnessing that there is no god but You (La ilaha illa llah), praising You (Al-Hamdu lillah), and asking \[favours\] of You. He says: And what do they ask of Me? They say: They ask of You Your Paradise. He says: And have they seen My Paradise? They say: No, O Lord. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Paradise! They say: And they ask protection of You. He says: From what do they ask protection of Me? They say: From Your Hell-fire, O Lord. He says: And have they seen My Hell-fire? They say: NO. He says: And how would it be were they to have seen My Hell-fire: They say: And they ask for Your forgiveness. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said: Then He says: I have forgiven them and I have bestowed upon them what they have asked for,and I have granted them sanctuary from that from which they asked protection. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said: They say: O Lord, among then is So-and-so, a much sinning servant, who was merely passing by and sat down with them. He (the Prophet p.b.u.h) said: And He says: And to him \[too\] I have given forgiveness: he who sits with such people shall not suffer.

It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, at-Tirmidhi, and an-Nasa'i).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 15:*

On the authority of Abu Harayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (PBUH) said: Alláh the Almighty said:

I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with him when he makes mention of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in an assemble better than it. And if he draws near to Me an arm's length, I draw near to him a fathom's length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed.
 Another possible rendering of the Arabic is: "I am as My servant expects Me to be". The meaning is that forgiveness and acceptance of repentance by the Almighty is subject to His servant truly believing that He is forgiving and merciful. However, not to accompany such belief with right action would be to mock the Almighty.

It was related by al-Buhkari (also by Muslim, at-Tirmidhi and Ibn-Majah).

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 16:*

On the authority of son of ‘Abbás (may Alláh be pleased with them both), from the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH), among the sayings he related from his Lord (glorified and exalted be He) is that He said:

Alláh has written down the good deeds and the bad ones. Then He explained it \[by saying that\] he who has intended a good deed and has not done it, Alláh writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Alláh writes it down with Himself as from ten good deeds to seven hundred times, or many times over. But if he has intended a bad deed and has not done it, Alláh writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Alláh writes it down as one bad deed.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 17:*

On the authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH) is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord (may He be glorified) is that He said:

O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you, O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him finds good praise Alláh and let him who finds other that blame no one but himself.

O son of Adam, I fell ill and you visited Me not. He will say: O Lord, and how should I visit You when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: Did you not know that My servant So-and-so had fallen ill and you visited him not? Did you not know that had you visited him you would have found Me with him? O son of Adam, I asked you for food and you fed Me not. He will say: O Lord, and how should I feed You when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: Did you not know that My servant So-and-so asked you for food and you fed him not? Did you not know that had you fed him you would surely have found that (the reward for doing so) with Me? O son of Adam, I asked you to give Me to drink and you gave Me not to drink. He will say: O Lord, how should I give You to drink whin You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: My servant So-and-so asked you to give him to drink and you gave him not to drink. Had you given him to drink you would have surely found that with Me.

My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask \[something\] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about \[seizing\] the soul of My faithful servant: he hates death and I hate hurting him.

Then the Prophet (pbuh) rapped his hand and said: Death will have come early to him, his mourners will have been few, his estate scant.
 i.e. he has not been ostentatious in his obedience.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 27:*

On the authority of Masruq, who said:

We asked ‘Abdu’lláh (i.e. Ibn Masud) about this verse: And do not regard those who have been killed in the cause of Alláh as dead, rather are they alive with their Lord, being provided for (Qur’án Chapter 3 Verse 169). He said: We asked about that and the Prophet (pbuh) said: Their souls are in the insides of green birds having lanterns suspended from the Throne, roaming freely in Paradise where they please, then taking shelter in those lanterns. So their Lord cast a glance at them and said: Do you wish for anything? They said: What shall we wish for when we roam freely in Paradise where we please? And thus did He do to them three times. When they say that they would not be spared from being asked \[again\], they said: O Lord, we would like for You to put back our souls into our bodies so that we might fight for Your sake once again. And when He saw that they were not in need of anything they were let be.
 i.e. at those who had been killed in the cause of Alláh.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 30:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said: Alláh (mighty and sublime be He) said:

If My servant likes to meet Me, I like to meet him; and if he dislikes to meet Me, I dislike to meet him. Prophetic explanation of this Sacred Ḥadít_h: He who likes to meet Alláh, Alláh likes to meet him; and he who dislikes to meet Alláh, Alláh dislikes to meet him. Aishah (may Alláh be pleased with her) said: O Prophet of Alláh, is it because of the dislike of death, for all of us dislike death? The Prophet (pbuh) said: It is not so, but rather it is that when the believer is given news of Alláh's mercy, His approval and His Paradise, he likes to meet Alláh and Alláh likes to meet him; but when the unbeliever is given news of Alláh's punishment and His displeasure, he dislikes to meet Alláh and Alláh dislikes to meet him.

It was related by al-Bukhari and Malik. The Prophetic version is related by Muslim.

 A similar Ḥadít_h, which is given by Abu Dawud, indicates that the person referred to was a goldly man whose previous good deeds were brought to nought through presuming to declare that Alláh would not forgive someone's bad deeds.

Then he sinned again and said: O Lord, forgive me my sin. And He (glorified and exalted be He) said: My servant has committed a sin and has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for them. Then he sinned again and said: O Lord, forgive me my sin. And He (glorified and exalted be He) said: My servant has committed a sin and has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for sins. Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 34:*

On the authority of Anas (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said: I heard the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) say: Alláh the Almighty said:

O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great at it.

It was related by at-Tirmidhi (also by Aḥmad ibn Hanbal). Its chain of authorities is sound.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 35:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said:

Our Lord (glorified and exalted be He) descends each night to the earth's sky when there remains the final third of the night, and He says: Who is saying a prayer to Me that I may answer it? Who is asking something of Me that I may give it him? Who is asking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?

It was related by al-Bukhari (also by Muslim, Malik, at-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud).

In a version by Muslim the Ḥadít_h ends with the words:

And thus He continues till \[the light of\] dawn shines.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 36:*

On the authority of Anas (may Alláh be pleased with him) from the Prophet (PBUH), who said:

The believers will gather together on the Day of Resurrection and will say: Should we not ask \[someone\] to intercede for us with our Lord? So they will come to Adam and will say: You are the Father of mankind; Alláh created you with His hand He made His angels bow down to you and He taught you the names of everything, so intercede for us with you Lord so that He may give us relief form this place where we are. And he will say: I am not in a position \[to do that\] - and he will mention his wrongdoing and will feel ashamed and will say: Go to Noah, for he is the first messenger that Alláh sent to the inhabitants of the earth. So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position \[to do that\] - and he will mention his having requested something of his Lord about which he had no \[proper\] knowledge (Qur’án Chapter 11 Verses 45-46), and he will feel ashamed and will say: Go to the Friend of the Merciful (Abraham). So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position \[to do that\]. Go to Moses, a servant to whom Alláh talked and to whom He gave the Torah. So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position \[to do that\] - and he will mention the talking of a life other that for a life (Qur’án Chapter 28 Verses 15-16), and he will fell ashamed in the sight of his Lord and will say: Go to Jesus, Alláh's servant and messenger, Alláh's word and spirit. So they will come to him and he will say: I am not in a position \[to do that\]. Go to Muḥammad (may the blessings and peace of Alláh be upon him), a servant to whom Alláh has forgiven all his wrongdoing, past and future. So they will come to me and I shall set forth to ask permission to come to my Lord, and permission will be given, and when I shall see my Lord I shall prostrate myself. He will leave me thus for such time as it pleases Him, and then it will be said \[to me\]: Raise your head. Ask and it will be granted. Speak and it will be heard. Intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So I shall raise my head and praise Him with a form of praise that He will teach me. Then I shall intercede and HE will set me a limit \[as to the number of people\], so I shall admit them into Paradise. Then I shall return to Him, and when I shall see my Lord \[I shall bow down\] as before. Then I shall intercede and He will set me a limit \[as to the number of people\]. So I shall admit them into Paradise. Then I shall return for a third time, then a fourth, and I shall say: There remains in Hell-fire only those whom the Qur’án has confined and who must be there for eternity. There shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said: There is no god but Alláh and who has in his heart goodness weighing a barley-corn; then there shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said: There is no god but Alláh and who has in his heart goodness weighing a grain of wheat; then there shall come out of Hell-fire he who has said: There is no god but Alláh and who has in his heart goodness weighing an atom.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 37:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said: Alláh said:

I have prepared for My righteous servants what no eye has seen and no ear has heard, not has it occurred to human heart. Thus recite if you wish: And no soul knows what joy for them (the inhabitants of Paradise) has been kept hidden (Qur’án Chapter 32 Verse 17).
 The words "Thus recite if you wish" are those of Abu Harayrah.

*Ḥadít_h Qudsi 38:*

On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Alláh be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Alláh (PBUH) said:

When Alláh created Paradise and Hell-fire, He sent Gabriel to Paradise, saying: Look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet (pbuh) said: So he came to it and looked at it and at what Alláh had prepared therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet (pbuh) said: So he returned to Him and said: By your glory, no one hears of it without entering it. So He ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and He said: Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants. The Prophet (pbuh) said: So he returned to it and found that it was encompassed by forms of hardship. Then he returned to Him and said: By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it. He said: Go to Hell-fire and look at it and what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants, and he fount that it was in layers, one above the other. Then he returned to Him and said: By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it. So He ordered that it be encompassed by lusts. Then He said: Return to it. And he returned to it and said: By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.
 The Arabic word used here is "makarih", the literal meaning of which is "things that are disliked". In this context it refers to forms of religious discipline that man usually finds onerous.

Paradise and Hell-fire disputed together, and Hell-fire said: In me are the mighty and the haughty. Paradise said: In me are the weak and the poor. So Alláh judged between them, \[saying\]: You are Paradise, My mercy; through you I show mercy to those I wish. And you are Hell-fire, My punishment; through you I punish those I wish, and it is incumbent upon Me that each of you shall have its fill.

Alláh will say to the inhabitant of Paradise: O inhabitants of Paradise! They will say: O our Lord, we present ourselves and are at Your pleasure, and goodness rests in Your hands. Then He will say: Are you contented? And they will say: And how should we not be contented, O Lord, when You have given to us that which You have given to no one else of Your creation? Then He will say: Would not like Me to give you something better than that? And they will say: O Lord and what thing is better than that? And He will say: I shall cause My favour to descend upon you and thereafter shall never be displeased with you.
